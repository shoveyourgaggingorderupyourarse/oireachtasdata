This means that there is no need for anyone to attend in person. All required documentation should be scanned and included in the electronic application.</p><p>Where a permission is granted, applicants will still be required to register when they have returned to Ireland or when appointments are available. </p><p>This temporary measure will be in place until 28 February 2021 and will be kept under review in light of the restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>All other eligibility criteria set out in the 2017 Revision of this Scheme will continue to apply. Full details are available on the Immigration Service website.  </p><p>Non-EEA students have also benefitted from the rolling extensions of immigration permissions announced by my predecessor and I during the pandemic. This ensures that students enrolled in a course of study can continue to be able to work part-time. The most recent extension is currently in place until 20 January 2021 and is being kept under review in my Department. </p></reply>

These are truly devastating events for families, friends and communities and the very real people and real heartache behind such terrible tragedies can never be forgotten.</p>  <p>  This is why the introduction of legislation to provide for Domestic Homicide Reviews is such an important commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  One of the key elements that will feed into delivering on this commitment is the independent study commissioned by the Department of Justice into familicide and domestic homicide reviews. This independent specialist research is looking at international best practice in the conduct of domestic homicide reviews with a view to making recommendations in relation to their application in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Ms Maura Butler, who is a solicitor and has been a member of the Study&rsquo;s Advisory Group since its establishment, agreed to take responsibility for leading completion of the study, following the sad and untimely death of Norah Gibbons, who was previously responsible. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee recently met with Ms Butler to receive an update in relation to this work. I would stress the importance of recognising that the Advisory Group and their work is independent, and the Department is not involved in the work of the study nor is it a member of the Advisory Group.   </p>  <p>  Ms Butler will provide a further update on progress made and we expect to receive the report from the Group in early 2021.  We look forward to examining the report in detail and will consider any recommendations made as a priority.</p>  <p>  I am aware Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan proposed a Private Members Bill seeking to ensure that perpetrators of domestic homicides could not benefit through inheritance. I know that Bill has lapsed, but I can inform the Deputy that I am progressing work to amend Section 120 of the Succession Act which will achieve the same objective. </p>  <p>  In parallel to this study, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently conducting a review of the investigation of certain homicides, which includes a number of domestic homicides, and is developing policies and procedures to inform the overall policing approach to domestic homicides.</p></reply>

Substance abuse and addiction affects people from all walks of life. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue, we can better help individuals, their families, and the communities in which we all live. </p><p>The National Drugs Strategy, <i>Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025</i>, provides a roadmap to achieving these aims by promoting a more compassionate approach to people who use drugs, with addiction treated firstly as a health issue.</p><p>In line with the recommendations of the Working Group to Consider Alternative Approaches to the Possession of Drugs for Personal Use, the previous Minister for Justice, along with the then Minister for Health and Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, announced the Health Diversion Approach in August 2019.</p><p>This approach allows for persons who are found to be in possession of controlled drugs which are, in the opinion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for personal use to be referred to the HSE for a mandatory health screening and brief intervention in the first offence. For a second offence, at the discretion of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in consultation with the DPP, the option of the issue of an adult caution instead of prosecution will be available. </p><p>An implementation, monitoring and evaluation group, chaired by the Department of Health, is implementing the health diversion programme. The Group is developing proposals to commence implementation of the programme on an administrative basis in a number of locations throughout the country in 2021. As outlined in the Programme for Government, a review of the programme will take place following the first full year of implementation, to ensure that it is meeting all of its aims. </p><p>I have been advised by the Courts Service that figures relating to convictions as requested cannot be broken down by Garda division as the Courts record data by Court venue. The Courts Service have advised that Section 3 offences for unlawful possession of drugs for the years specified were as follows:</p><p>2015 - 2,625</p><p>2016 - 3,726</p><p>2017 - 3,514</p><p>2018 - 4,915</p><p>2019 - 4,195</p><p>2020 (to end of October) - 3,438</p><p>It is important to note that these are the number of convictions secured and that the number of persons convicted differs as multiple charges or appearances in different Court venues are recorded. A report providing a full breakdown of these figures, as well as convictions for other offences relating to possession for sale or supply, will be provided for the Deputy's information. </p></reply>

As I said the last time I spoke on this issue, I understand that he was an exceptional young man and his death was a terrible tragedy. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, is currently conducting the scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of the late Shane O'Farrell. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to my predecessor last November and following consultations between the Judge, Shane's family and the Attorney General, the interim report was published on 17 December 2019. </p>  <p>  In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress. In this correspondence, the Judge requested a further extension of the timeline to 29 January 2021 and set out a clear and detailed rationale for this extension.  I understand the Judge has also provided a copy of this letter to the O'Farrell family and I have written to the family to inform them of the extension.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret this further delay I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible and this requires additional time.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that it is of course open to the Judge to make any recommendation he sees fit in his final report, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is appropriate to await the recommendation of the final report of this scoping exercise before making any decision in relation to further inquiries into this matter.</p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that it is my intention to publish the outcome of the scoping exercise, subject to the advice of the Attorney General. </p></reply>

The significant level of funding provided over recent years is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, there are now some 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide. Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to<b></b>620 new Garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff<b>.</b></p><p>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the general management and administration of Garda business, including decisions on operational deployment of members and resources. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.</p><p>However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Winter Phase of Operation Thor commenced on 1st October 2020 and will run until the end of March 2021. Operation Thor is designed to specifically tackle the anticipated increase in the number of burglaries and associated criminal activity that usually occur in winter months by undertaking targeted enforcement and preventative activity. This initiative has successfully reduced the rate of winter burglaries, leading to a significant decline of 40% in property related crime since its introduction in 2015.</p><p>With regard to organised crime, sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition. In the first six months of 2020, Garda operations to counter organised crime resulted in the seizure of &euro;13.6m in illicit drugs, 13 firearms and 2,000 rounds of ammunition. </p><p>This work has continued throughout the autumn and winter months including the seizure of approximately &euro;7 million of cannabis on 23rd October. The Deputy may also be interested to note an operation on 3rd November whereby the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) seized cannabis with an estimated street value of &euro;1 million in the Kildare area.  </p><p>Finally, I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the bureau seized over &euro;7.5 million in cash from the start of the year up until the 31st October.</p></reply>

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction. Consequently, the Programme for Government commits to prioritising visible policing in rural and urban communities.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. </p><p>There are now some 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide and Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to 620 new Garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff. There will also be continued investment in the Garda Fleet of &euro;8 million in addition to the highest ever investment of approximately &euro;15 million in the Garda Transport Fleet in 2020 &ndash; a proportion of which relates to the Garda Covid response. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Mayo Division has increased, from 3 at the end of 2017, to 12 as of 31 October 2020. </p><p>The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing whilst performing their duties. This has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have provided exceptional service in assisting the national effort to combat the threat of COVID-19, ordinary policing has also continued unabated throughout the pandemic. </p><p>The Winter Phase of Operation Thor began on 1 October 2020 and will run until the end of March 2021. Operation Thor is designed to specifically tackle the increase in the number of burglaries and associated criminal activity that usually occurs in the winter months by undertaking targeted enforcement and preventative activity.  This initiative has successfully reduced the rate of winter burglaries, leading to a significant decline in property related crime since its introduction in 2015. </p><p>This initiative has successfully reduced the rate of residential burglaries at this time of year by 41% since its introduction in 2015.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, it was necessary to suspend physical visits to prisons, firstly in March and again in October, following public health guidance.  The Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and a new video visit system was introduced which has allowed families to continue to support those in custody and the feedback from both prisoners and their families about this has been generally positive. The Prison Service fully appreciate how important contact with family and friends are to people in custody. When physical visits recommence, the Service will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners. </p>  <p>  I understand that additional phone calls have been also been facilitated. </p>  <p>  The IPS has announced arrangements to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between 16 December and 6 January.  Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit, limited to two people, which is limited to 15 minutes in duration.  I understand this time limit is necessary to ensure that the maximum number of visits can be facilitated, having regard to the need to reduce the number of booths in use for distancing purposes and the need to fully sanitise surfaces between visitors.  All visits will be behind clear screens and visitors and prisoners will be required to wear a face mask at all times. No physical contact will be permitted.</p>  <p>  All visitors will also be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedures which have been in place since March and visitors are requested not to attend if they have any symptoms, have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing, if they themselves have tested positive for Covid and have yet to be cleared by their doctor, or if they have been abroad in the preceding fortnight.</p>  <p>  Prisoners will continue to be able to avail of a 20 minute video visit and an additional daily phone call is also being facilitated during the Christmas period. </p>  <p>  I understand this is very difficult for the families concerned, particularly after such a difficult year.  However, the IPS have worked tirelessly to safeguard prisoners and staff and this continues to be the primary consideration.  We are all hoping next year will be a very different year but for now IPS must continue to ensure that the prison population is protected from the virus and they are continuing to make use of alternative means of keeping prisoners and their families connected. </p>  <p>  [Following the return to Level 3 under the Governments Framework for Living with Covid-19, the IPS will be facilitating temporary release for a small cohort of prisoners as is the normal practice at Christmas. Applications are currently being assessed and as always public safety will be paramount in making any decision.  Prisoners will be required to quarantine on their return to prison.  Further details on this will be announced by the IPS later this month.]</p></reply>

The group is a high-level group that will co-ordinate the delivery of the various elements of this project.</p>  <p>  I am due to meet with the Group in the morning where plans for a consultation process to be commenced in the New Year will be discussed. Recognising the importance of taking account of the voice of the child, a consultation aimed specifically at ascertaining the views of children who engage with the family justice system will also occur.</p>  <p>  The consultation process will provide an opportunity for all those involved in family justice, both as practitioners and users, to participate in the development of a modernised national family justice system. This is not just about providing the necessary infrastructure, we need to ensure that all necessary ancillary supports are available to support the development of a robust and compassionate system.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and to provide for court procedures that support a less adversarial resolution of disputes.</p>  <p>  In September, I secured Government approval to draft the Family Court Bill.</p>  <p>  In the preparation of the General Scheme, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System, published in October 2019.  </p>  <p>  The publication of the General Scheme is a first step in an ongoing process of improving how people are able to resolve family-based problems that require a legal solution.  The overall aim is to change the culture so that the focus of the family justice system meets the complex needs of people who need help with family justice issues.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is not possible at this stage to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published or to predict the timeframe for the legislative process with regard to the Bill after its publication.</p></reply>

I am very grateful that my request for extra D&aacute;il and Seanad time to be made available to allow the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill to complete its passage before the end of the year, could be facilitated. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, at Committee stage last week I brought forward a range of amendments to the Bill as presented by Deputy Howlin, including to provide for two new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images, which have been accepted. These 2 new offences will make it a crime to distribute intimate images of a person without consent, regardless of the motivation for doing so.</p>  <p>  Consenting to the taking of an image will be irrelevant, if it is subsequently published or distributed without consent. The penalties being proposed are serious to reflect the level of harm caused to the victims of such offences</p>  <p>  It will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator is, or was, in an intimate relationship with the victim. This will allow a judge to consider the additional harm a victim suffers as a result of the betrayal of trust that would have formed part of their relationship with the perpetrator.</p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I are committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. Harassment and abuse is utterly unacceptable, whether online or offline, and it has no place in Irish society. </p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of Deputy Brendan Howlin in advancing the proposed amendments. I very much welcome the widespread support expressed for enacting this legislation, including by the Deputy, and I look forward to this Bill being enacted before the year end. </p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made regarding the cases in Cork city and county. The Courts Service has provided information in tabular format as requested, which I shall make available to the Deputy. </p><p><b>The number of cases waiting to be heard by the various courts serving Cork on 4 December 2020, in tabular form</b></p><p>The Courts Service has advised that in the time available, it is unfortunately not possible to collate all of the information sought by the Deputy. In addition, some of the Courts Service&rsquo;s systems do not allow a collation of information for specific dates such as 4 December or retrospectively back to 2019. However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy, the Courts Service have advised the following which is based on data collated at intervals by the Courts Service throughout the year.</p><p>In relation to the <b>Circuit Court,</b>Cork Circuit Court had at 4 December 2020: <table>    <tr>       <th>Type of Business</th>       <th>Number of cases on hand</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Circuit Family Court hearings</td>       <td>140 cases listed for hearing</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Circuit Civil Court hearings</td>       <td>750 cases listed for hearing</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Circuit Criminal Court Trials</td>       <td>133 trials listed and 77 for sentencing</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Courts Service&rsquo;s systems do not allow it to measure the numbers of cases on hand for hearing this time last year. However, the data collated shows that at the end of Q3 2020, there has been a 64% reduction in the numbers of civil cases disposed of and 14% reduction in the numbers of family law cases disposed of when compared with the same period in 2019.</p><p>The data in relation to the <b>District Court</b>is measured differently: <table>    <tr>       <th>Location</th>       <th>Criminal (Summonses Cases) Awaiting Hearing</th>       <th>Family Law Cases <br /><br />Awaiting Hearing</th>       <th>Civil Cases <br /><br />Awaiting Hearing</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>10,031</td>       <td>803</td>       <td>225</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clonakilty</td>       <td>2117</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mallow</td>       <td>3106</td>       <td>176</td>       <td>55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Youghal</td>       <td>323</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The public health guidelines limit the numbers of people who can circulate in indoor venues and court buildings are no exception to this. In addition to enhanced cleaning, people traffic management and sanitisation facilities, arrangements have been put in place to ensure social distancing in courthouses to ensure public safety. In order to manage the numbers of people attending courthouses, court lists have been staggered to prevent overcrowding. The net effect is that regretfully fewer cases can be listed every day to ensure that maximum attendance levels in courthouses are not exceeded.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 period, the Courts Service along with the President of the District Court has been prioritising criminal and urgent family law matters. </p><p>The Courts Service has been working to add capacity to the system. The Government&rsquo;s stimulus package assigned &euro;5m to the Courts Service, which has been used to lease extra facilities to conduct court hearings and for jury empanelment. In addition, the additional funding has been used to install additional video technology facilities to facilitate remote court sittings. I am advised that the remote court facilities using video technology installed in Cork has been used 35 times since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been most frequently used since the start of October.  &euro;5.7 million of additional funding was provided in the Budget for the Courts Service, including for additional premises  in Dublin and regional locations to enable court sittings to take place in a socially distanced and safe environment.</p><p>The Courts Service has also been working with Judges to arrange additional sittings, hold callovers of cases and other initiatives to help mitigate the effect of any arrears that have developed. </p><p>Circuit Criminal Court Trials began in Cork for the week beginning 30th November 2020.  The Court Service continues to make progress and to adjust their plans in line with emerging developments with the overall aim being to work towards getting back to waiting times that are better than pre-Covid levels in due course.</p></reply>

I understand that the current interest in catalytic converter theft may be directly associated with the current high price of palladium available on the market. </p>  <p>  Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region have taken a proactive, co-ordinated and targeted approach in response to this issue. Information and intelligence in relation to individuals and gangs involved in the theft of catalytic converters continues to be assessed, evaluated and developed. This approach has resulted in a number of successful Garda operations this year in the DMR. Garda&iacute; have delivered a number of co-ordinated and managed arrests of individuals identified as being involved in or associated with thefts of these devices and searches of certain locations and properties which resulted in the seizure of catalytic converters. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for offences of theft, the handling of stolen property and the possession of stolen property.  The offence of theft provided for by this legislation would, based on the broad nature of the offence, include the theft of &lsquo;scrap metal&rsquo; and &lsquo;catalytic converters.&rsquo;  Maximum sentences of 10 years are provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while maximum sentences of 5 years are provided for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p>  <p>  Irish law relating to the sale and purchase of scrap metal is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and arises under the Waste Management Act 1996. The Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 apply to the sale and purchase of scrap metals and were designed to improve the traceability of such scrap metal sales.  The regulations impose an obligation on businesses to apply due diligence measures to ensure the traceability of any waste purchased. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are involved in the Metal Theft Forum, which is a collaborative working group between State stakeholders and industry representatives to improve information sharing around the issue of metal theft.</p>  <p>  Community Garda&iacute; are also available to provide crime prevention advice to residents groups in areas affected by thefts, and Garda members keep injured parties appraised as to the status of investigations at all times.</p></reply>

It seeks to record the economic and social conditions of the period, the shifts in cultural norms as well as the experience of the Irish abroad.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach is grounded in the principles laid out by the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media are responsible for the development and delivery of a cross-governmental programme to mark Phase II of the Decade of Centenaries, which is running from 2019 to 2023.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has referenced, an event had been planned to mark the role in Irish history of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Royal Irish Constabulary.  My predecessor decided earlier this year to defer this event pending further consultation, including with the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations, the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations and with other stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  My Department is still considering how best to mark the elements of Phase II of the Decade of Centenaries programme which fall within the Justice sector, including the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the establishment of the Courts, and the history of the Department itself.  However, there are no plans to reschedule the event which was postponed earlier this year.   </p></reply>

These specific recommendations will form part of a wider Leadership and Development Strategy, encompassing recruit and in-service training and continuous professional development.  </p>  <p>  The Leadership and Management (LMD) section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides development programmes to newly promoted personnel ranging from Sergeant to Chief Superintendent rank and Executive Officer to Principal Officer grade. Each programme takes place over a period of 18 - 24 months and a total of 3,614 members and staff have participated to date.</p>  <p>  In addition, several bespoke Leadership Programmes are provided by third level institutions. There have been 763 participants in these programmes over the last 3 years. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that Continuous Professional Development in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes two forms:</p>  <p>  1. The Leadership Development as mentioned as above, and</p>  <p>  2.

This review is in place to provide for situations where an applicant&rsquo;s circumstances may have changed in a material way since the initial decision was made to refuse permission to remain. </p>  <p>  If the appeal to the IPAT and the review of the permission to remain refusal are unsuccessful, the applicant is given an opportunity to avail of the option of voluntary return. Where this option is not availed of, and the person has no other permission to remain in the State, and no other immigration application pending, subject to a refoulement consideration, a deportation order is made. </p>  <p>If a Deportation Order is made, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.  In making a revocation request a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.  </p></reply>

The response from the JAAB is considered by Government in the first instance, in line with the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended.</p>  <p>  Eligible serving Judges who wish to express an interest in elevation to positions in the superior courts are not required to apply to Judicial Advisory Appointments Board (JAAB). Instead, there is a process whereby expressions of interest may be submitted to the Minister of the day via the office of the Attorney General.   Such expressions of interest are received on an ongoing basis and retained for any current or future vacancy that might arise. </p>  <p>  Whether or not existing judges put forward expressions of interest is a confidential matter for obvious reasons, and it is not the practice to release information that might identify any of those judges.  All such submissions are treated in a highly confidential manner. </p>  <p>  Every eligible judge is considered as part of the appointment process. This includes judges who have made an explicit expression of interest as well as all eligible judges who have not made an expression of interest for a particular appointment. </p>  <p>  In line with the Cabinet Handbook, in regard to judicial appointments the Minister discusses the matter with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Attorney General [and any other Party Leaders in a coalition Government] before making a nomination to Government.   </p>  <p>  As I outlined to the House on 26 November last, I cannot get into the criteria under which an application from a sitting judge is evaluated. There are still names of serving judges who have applied for judicial vacancies on file in my Department including a vacancy in the Supreme Court.  If that vacancy is to be filled, they will again be looked at.  It is therefore not appropriate for me to comment on applicable criteria.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform the judicial appointments process and I intend to bring forward new legislation to do this very quickly.</p></reply>

While the National Development Plan provides for the construction of county town type court facilities at various locations including Bray, the Boghall Road site is considered unsuitable in terms of both size and location. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Courts Service did examine the possibility of using the building to augment existing court facilities in Bray; however, this was not considered feasible. The Courts Service has no plans for this building at present and it is considered to be surplus to requirements.  In these circumstances, I am informed that the Courts Service, in the first instance, offers the property to the relevant local authority or the OPW for alternative public use.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Courts Service would be willing to explore transferring ownership of the building to Wicklow County Council so that it can be made available for alternative public/community use. </p></reply>

As I said the last time I spoke on this issue, I understand that he was an exceptional young man and his death was a terrible tragedy. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a retired Judge, Gerard Haughton, is currently conducting the scoping exercise into the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of the late Shane O'Farrell. </p>  <p>  Judge Haughton furnished an interim report to my predecessor last November and following consultations between the Judge, Shane's family and the Attorney General, the interim report was published on 17 December 2019. </p>  <p>  In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress.

However, there has unavoidably been some delays. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to processing applications for international protection at first instance with the aim to reduce median processing times to 9 months or below as soon as possible. It also commits to ensuring that additional resources designated for the International Protection Office (IPO) are deployed in the most efficient and effective way possible to increase the output of quality decisions. I was pleased to secure an additional &euro;1.75m in Budget 2021 for the efficient functioning of the international protection system, which will help us to further improve processing times for applications.</p>  <p>  The IPO is working hard to try to achieve a target of 9 months in the vast majority of cases.  Efforts to improve processing times have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions considerably. At the end of Q3 2020, the median processing time for all cases processed at first instance in that quarter was 18.3 months and 14 months for prioritised cases.  This is compared with the position at the end of Q1 2020 where the median processing times for all cases processed in that quarter was 14.7 months and 9.8 months for prioritised cases.  The number of cases on hand at the IPO is just over 5,000 at present.</p>  <p>  For appeals against negative recommendations of the IPO, the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) had set as an objective this year that the average processing times, where an oral hearing is required, would be reduced to 90 working days. However, this has understandably been impacted due to the pandemic. All scheduled onsite hearings were postponed from 22 October 2020 due to Level 5 restrictions.  They recommenced again on 1 December 2020, in line with the move to Level 3 restrictions. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to achieving a reduction in processing times for both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months each respectively as far as possible in line with the recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group. An end to end process review is currently underway which will help guide on the approach and resource requirements.  I also secured additional funding in Budget 2021 to support our ICT strategy, a significant portion of which will be used for immigration and international protection purposes.  </p>  <p>  Regarding citizenship applications, in general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks can take a considerable period of time with the result in some applications taking longer than the average timescale. </p>  <p>  At the end of October there were 23,187 applications being processed at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Citizenship Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. </p>  <p>  My Department is working on various solutions to process the existing caseload on hand, including the enhanced website which provides prospective applicants with greater information than before, the roll-out earlier this year of the e-payments facility, along with a range of other ICT solutions which are being progressed. Moving to e-tax clearance and e-Vetting will also support speedier processing going forward.  The situation continues to be monitored in order to improve service to our customers.</p>  <p>I recently announced that citizenship ceremonies will be temporarily replaced,  while COVID-19 restrictions are in place,  with a requirement for citizenship applicants to sign an affidavit declaring loyalty to the State. I expect that the Statutory Instrument to give effect to this change will be in place early in the New Year. It is my intention that in-person citizenship ceremonies will recommence as soon as circumstances allow.  </p></reply>

I can inform the Deputy that officials in my Department are already working to develop legislation in this regard and it is intended to bring proposals to Government in the form of a General Scheme in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a complex area as in many cases the adult in question is known to the child and may in some cases even be a family member, causing potential issues with regard to witness testimony.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may be aware of the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, published in December 2016, which was produced at the School of Law in the University of Limerick and examined the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland. The Report outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations. As part of the wider 'Greentown' project, targeted interventions are to be piloted to further protect children in Ireland from becoming involved in criminal networks.</p>  <p>  With regard to broader issues of youth justice, the Deputy may also wish to note that my Department is currently finalising a new Youth Justice Strategy and it is intended to bring a final Strategy to Government shortly. </p></reply>

But the virus does remain a threat and so we all must continue to play our part by heeding the public health advice. This is the best way of protecting ourselves, our loved ones and our neighbours.</p></reply>

I know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been and will continue to be intensively engaged in bringing those responsible to justice.  </p>  <p>  The reason that I engaged Vivian Geiran to oversee a scoping exercise in the Drogheda area is that policing and preventing harm is not the responsibility of the Garda&iacute; alone, and involves other agencies of Government and sectors of society. This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed in my Department. </p>  <p>  I asked Mr Geiran to engage with relevant residents, services, organisations, businesses and other stakeholders in the community in order to identify opportunities to connect and support existing services in the area. I would like to commend the excellent cooperation from the community in Drogheda and all the groups that Mr Geiran has sought to engage with, including the elected representatives. I have been very impressed with the services in the community and the way they have made themselves available. People have also proactively approached me offering their time to help with this exercise. </p>  <p>  Mr Geiran is in the process of finalising his recommendations in relation to short and long-term responses to the challenges faced by communities in this area. I receive regular updates on how the work of Mr Geiran is progressing and I am aware of the preliminary recommendations and areas of focus that are emerging. Inter-agency cooperation and coordination is going to be central to improving the experience and safety of residents in Drogheda. When it comes to crime prevention, wraparound supports can be effective in breaking the cycle of crime and the impact of that crime on the community. There will also need to be a strong focus on ensuring that activities promoting wellbeing, safety and leadership for children and young people in Drogheda are supported. These are preliminary observations and Mr Geiran&rsquo;s full report will be completed this month.  </p>  <p>  My Department will carefully consider the actions and recommendations in Mr Geiran&rsquo;s report and engage with relevant services and stakeholders in Drogheda in order to take them forward.</p></reply>

The Act provides for a minimum age for engaging in gaming and lottery activity at 18 years. This applies to small scale gaming activities and sale of tickets for local lotteries. The Act also applies the 18 years of age requirement for betting on the Tote. </p>  <p>  The Betting Act 1931 &ndash; which is the responsibility of the Minister of Finance already imposed the 18 years of age requirement by licensed bookmakers, either operating land based or online. Likewise, the National Lottery Act 2013 &ndash; which is the responsibility of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform - imposes an 18 years of age limit for purchase of tickets.</p>  <p>  All licensed operators are under a statutory duty to take all necessary steps to ensure that sales of whatever type of gambling product they might offer are not made to persons under the age of 18. There is some responsibility in this regard on parents as well.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and wellbeing, covering gambling online and in person, and the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps.</p>  <p>  Legislation is being prepared in my Department to comprehensively reform our approach to gambling. This will include the requirement of the effective &ldquo;Know your Customer&rdquo; process. Age verification will be a central part of that approach so as to prevent persons under 18 years of age from engaging in gambling.</p></reply>

This was an initial meeting and more detailed terms of reference and a programme of work for the forum will be decided shortly. </p>  <p>  There are potential areas of overlap with the Youth Justice Strategy, which is at an advanced stage</p>  <p>  of preparation, and this will be taken into account in deciding the particular areas of focus for the forum.

While many reforms have been introduced, there are still a number of long standing issues which need more work to be resolved and I understand this is where the focus must be.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, one area highlighted by the Committee for immediate attention is how the complex needs of people with mental health difficulties who come into contact with the criminal justice system are provided for. The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the me as Minister for Justice and for Minister Donnelly. </p><p>It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental / cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. </p><p>In order the progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted Task Force with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the system should have access to comprehensive mental health support, the Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. </p><p>This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. </p><p>I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a range of other matters have also been raised by the Committee in the report and I am pleased to say that a significant amount of work is underway to address the concerns raised.  A review of the use of Safety Observation Cells, has already commenced as has a review of the relevant Prison Rules taking account of the most recently published Council of Europe - European Prison Rules. I understand that appropriate Standard Operating Procedures and training in relation to the use of both Safety Observation and Close Supervision Cells will also be implemented. </p><p>In terms of the comments by the Committee regarding restricted regimes, I can confirm that the IPS are undertaking a series of measures to address this issue. I understand that the IPS will review the recording process for out of cell time for prisoners on restricted regimes and introduce a standardised recording for all prisoners on restricted regimes</p><p>It is a requirement of the IPS Policy on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement thatGovernors ensure adequate and correct record-keeping. Since the CPT visit, the need for accuraterecording of regime levels has been re-enforced to Governors at both the Solitary Confinement Group (chaired by the DG) and also at the IPS Strategy and Policy Group meeting, which all Governors and Operational Governors attend. Staff have been issued with a reminder of the importance of accurate record keeping. A new standardised reporting book for prisoners on restricted regimes is being introduced to all locations. To enhance the recording of out of cell time, the IPS will review the recording process for out of cell time for prisoners on restricted regimes across the system and introduce a standardised recording of all prisoners on Restricted Regime. Consideration will also be given to incorporating this process into the Prison Information Management System (PIMS). </p><p>I think that it is important to note that the numbers on a restricted regime reflect the challenge faced by the Prison Service to provide safe custody for all those in their care. The DG of the IPS chairs a high-level group to look at measures, which can be introduced to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes. The objective of this group is to ensure that all prisoners receive a minimum standard out of cell time, to engage in exercise or activity consistent with IPS on the Elimination of Solitary Confinement. </p><p>Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that this Government and the IPS are fully committed to implementing the longer-term changes required to make our penal system safe, effective and responsive to the needs of all prisoners, especially vulnerable persons. While there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system. </p><p>Further details on the report can be found on the website of the Committee at </p></reply>

The report also recommended the reform of the current roster system to support the wellbeing of all Garda Members and introducing greater flexibility in work practices to enhance the attractiveness and job satisfaction of policing as a career.</p><p>In recent years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken a number of steps to support the implementation of the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty with respect to Garda personnel.  A notable example includes the development of recruitment material in 12 different languages for their most recent Garda trainee recruitment campaign. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also made significant strides towards ensuring that the Garda uniform accommodates religious diversity.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy and Action Plan 2020-2021 aims to encourage a work environment where all employees can thrive.  In particular, there is a focus on improvements to worklife balance, reasonable accommodation for disability and mental health, and the promotion of an intercultural workplace. </p><p>In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Garda Commissioner launched An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion (EDI) Strategy Statement &amp;amp; Action Plan 2020 &ndash; 2021 on 1 December 2020. The EDI Strategy &amp;amp; Action Plan identifies a number of priority actions that align with the external Diversity and Integration Strategy 2019 &ndash; 2021 and will lay the foundations to drive the equality, diversity and inclusion agenda forward within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and reinforces key ethical behaviours to support the delivery of an effective policing service. </p><p>I am informed that the plan will assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in striving to ensure that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda Reserves and Garda staff are unhindered by workplace discrimination regardless of age, gender, disability, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, race, religious belief, or membership of the Traveller community.</p><p>This includes: </p><p>- Establishing an EDI Leadership Council and EDI Policy to set out a statement of standards.</p><p>- Providing EDI training to all personnel and introduce employee engagement on EDI matters.</p><p>- Continuing to support work-life balance options, including family-friendly initiatives.</p><p>- An amended Uniform Policy to avoid inadvertent gender discrimination. </p><p>- Developing a Gender Identity Policy.</p><p>- Identifying and resolving key challenges related to the recruitment of individuals from minority background.</p><p>- Developing guidelines on the use of professional and non-discriminatory language in the workplace.</p><p>- Continuing to support reasonable accommodation in regards to disability and mental health.</p><p>- Collecting data on all grounds covered within the equality legislation and within the bounds of data protection.</p><p>Over the next 18 months, the necessary resources, leadership and infrastructure will be put in place to see this Strategy and Action Plan through to its successful completion.</p></reply>

Further, such trends are reported by the Commissioner to the Central Statistics Office on a regular basis. The CSO is responsible for reporting on these trends and this information is published on their website each quarter at the following link:</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government commits to a health-led approach to drugs misuse. Substance abuse and addiction affects people from all walks of life. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue, we can better help individuals, their families, and the communities in which we all live. </p><p>The National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025, provides a roadmap to achieving these aims by promoting a more compassionate approach to people who use drugs, with addiction treated firstly as a health issue. Primary responsibility for this lies with my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility Public Health, Well Being and the National Drugs Strategy, although the Strategy of course includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>Ireland's National Drugs Strategy is unique across EU members in that it includes consideration of drug-related intimidation. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN), has developed &lsquo;The Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&rsquo;, which is now been implemented on a national level since 2013, to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation.</p><p>I also intend to shortly bring to Government proposals with regard to criminalising adults who groom children to use in criminality.  </p><p>Hand in hand with this preventative work, and recognising the link between organised crime and illegal drugs, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to relentlessly target all forms of organised crime throughout the pandemic. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition. In the first six months of 2020, Garda operations to counter organised crime resulted in the seizure of &euro;13.6m in illicit drugs, 13 firearms and 2,000 rounds of ammunition. </p><p>This work has continued throughout the autumn and winter months including the seizure of approximately &euro;7 million of cannabis on 23rd October and a seizure of cannabis on 3rd November with an estimated street value of &euro;1 million.  </p></reply>

Services need to work together to tackle the range of issues that makes a community feel unsafe, which goes beyond the sole remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Strong community participation in identifying the needs of a community and developing solutions is also key. This new approach is to be established on a pilot basis ahead of a nationwide rollout as part of 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing. I recently announced that these pilots will be located in North Inner City Dublin, Waterford and Longford.</p>  <p>  Another Programme for Government commitment is the establishment of an Anti-Social Behaviour Forum. The first meeting of the Forum was chaired by my colleague Minister of State Browne on 27 October.  This was an initial meeting and more detailed terms of reference and a work programme for the forum are being formulated.  There are potential areas of overlap with the Youth Justice Strategy, which is at an advanced stage of preparation, and this will be taken into account in deciding the particular areas of focus for the forum.</p>  <p>  With respect to the situation in Cork City, I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the Deputy's suggestion was previously raised at the Cork City JPC with the Chief Superintendent, Cork City Division.  Following consideration of this proposal with Community Policing Sergeants operating in the Division, it was confirmed that open channels of communication already exist between these parties. </p>  <p>  For example, I understand that Community Safety Forums, normally held at least three times per year throughout the City, facilitate members of the public in highlighting issues of concern and, in particular, antisocial behaviour patterns.  Any location highlighted as a concern for Anti-Social Behaviour is noted at such meetings and put on a tasking sheet within the relevant functional area for increased patrols to be conducted.</p>  <p>  Community Policing Garda&iacute; across the City are in regular contact with Community representatives, Councillors, Resident Associations and members of the public and in general share and gather information around issues of Anti-Social Behaviour.  Community Policing Units target the particular areas in an effort to alleviate the issue and tasking sheets are updated on a weekly basis.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Garda Authorities in Cork City are in constant contact with Cork City Partnership, Barnardos , Hollyhill Youth Project , North Link , HSE , Cork City Council , Friendly Call Cork as well as local sporting clubs. Community Policing members also liaise with Muintir Na Tire around safety for the elderly and particularly those living in areas with reported incidence of anti-social behaviour. The JPC also provides a forum where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na links in with external agencies to identify problem areas across the city.</p></reply>

However, to secure the community engagement that we want for this new partnership, it is crucial that we engage with residents, new communities and minority communities, as well as schools. </p>  <p>  Ensuring strong community engagement is at the heart of the community safety approach. For this reason, my Department and Dublin City Council are developing an engagement plan for the community in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City. This will enable us to better understand how to support their participation. Following the community engagement process, the partnership will have its first meeting early in the new year. </p>  <p>  Each Local Community Safety Partnership will be actively supported by a dedicated resource within the local authority whose role is to support the Partnership, engage the residents in the community on safety issues and link them in with the work of the Partnership.  Dublin City Council will launch a recruitment process this month for support staff for the Dublin pilot of the Local Community Safety Partnership.</p>  <p>  My Department has also engaged with the Chief Executives of Longford County Council and Waterford City and County Council to begin preparations for the Longford and Waterford pilots.  Officials in my Department will meet with local elected representatives of Longford County Council in January to progress the roll-out of the pilot. They will also be further engaging with Waterford County Council in January. Our intention is to have the local community safety partnerships in these areas set up in early 2021.  </p>  <p>  The pilot projects have to adapt to new conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is important that we look at new ways of working with the community and service providers, of building relationships and collaborating. </p>  <p>  The tender for evaluation for the pilots, which will begin around the same time as the pilot launches, has been published and the deadline for submissions for this is 18 December. </p></reply>

So, although An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are seizing more knives, the number of people who are presenting to hospital with the more serious injuries which require an overnight stay is dropping. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating a Reduction Strategy 2019-2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults, including use of knives. This strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early-investigation and proactive high-visibility approach. It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness. The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and operationally appropriate.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.  </p>  <p>  At an operational level, I am informed that Garda&iacute; pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has published a new draft Youth Justice Strategy.  The draft Strategy is currently being refined with reference to the outcome of the recent public consultation and the views of key stakeholders and I expect to be in a position to present the finalised version to Government in the near future.</p></reply>

While it is unlikely there are quick fix solutions to some of the issues as highlighted by the recent report from the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevent of Torture, we are determined to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system.  </p></reply>

Dublin City Council commissioned this report in response to the escalating levels of violence in the Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview areas of north Dublin in 2019 and 2020, and my officials have been in contact with Dublin City Council on this matter. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the area&rsquo;s assets, services, and supports as well as its challenges. </p>  <p>  As well as important recommendations related to crime prevention and dismantling gangs, two key recommendations in the report include the need to strengthen community participation and leadership, and the need for more collaborative service delivery.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Dublin City Council and former Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan on the follow up to this report in order to see how we can best support responses in the area. I am aware that an Oversight Group is being established by Dublin City Council and engagement with local councillors to discuss implementation will take place in January 2021. My Department will actively support the implementation of this report. My Department has also offered to meet with Deputies in the Dublin Bay North constituency this month to discuss initiatives in the area.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is also currently developing a Community Safety Policy which takes a new approach to policing, crime prevention and youth engagement. It echoes many of the elements in the Darndale report, including the importance of strengthening community representation and leadership. Strong community participation in identifying the needs of a community and developing solutions is key.  Also central to the new policy is a more collaborative approach to service delivery, as identified in the report. Services need to work together to tackle the range of issues that makes a community feel unsafe, which goes beyond the sole remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This new approach is to be established on a pilot basis ahead of a nationwide rollout as part of 'A Policing Service for our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with a number of Departments in relation to the development of our community safety policy. In tackling community safety issues, it is important that the right supports are available to an area.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to note that a new Garda Building and Refurbishment programme 2022-2027 is currently under discussion between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the OPW and officials from my Department.  This plan will include a new DMR North Divisional HQ at Northern Cross. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy will be aware of the commitment in the Programme for Government to convene an expert forum on anti-social behaviour and this will provide a key focus for further development of policy in this area. In addition, the Programme for Government further commits to developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, which will be finalised shortly and which will provide a national developmental framework to pursue more effective engagement, collaboration and community support related to youth offending and the factors which underlie it.</p></reply>

While I believe that there is much we can be proud of, I fully accept that there are still a number of long standing issues which need more work to be resolved and I understand this is where the focus must be.</p>  <p>  One area highlighted by the Committee for immediate attention is how the complex needs of people with mental health difficulties who come into contact with the criminal justice system are provided for. The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the me as Minister for Justice and for Minister Donnelly. </p>  <p>  It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental / cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. </p>  <p>  In order the progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted Task Force with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.</p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the system should have access to comprehensive mental health support, the Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. </p>  <p>  This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a range of other matters have also been raised by the Committee in the report and I am pleased to say that a significant amount of work is underway to address the concerns raised.  </p>  <p>  The IPS will be implementing a new prisoner complaints system before the end of 2020 which, when bedded down, will include an oversight role for the Ombudsman and a detailed information and awareness campaign for prisoners on the new system will also be rolled out across the prison estate.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that work has now been completed on a new Block F in Cloverhill prison which is intended to be used to accommodate persons detained for immigration purposes and ensure they can be housed separately from other remand prisoners. While this will address the situation in the immediate term, work is also proceeding on the consideration of a longer-term sustainable and compliant solution.</p>  <p>  In relation to the use of Close Supervision Cells and Safety Observation Cells, the IPS has already commenced, in conjunction with officials working on the development of penal policy in my Department, a review of the Prison Rules taking account of the most recently published Council of Europe - European Prison Rules.  It is intended that the operation, management and governance of these cells will be considered as part of this review and a clear distinction between the operation of Close Supervision Cells and Safety Observation Cells will be made. I understand that appropriate Standard Operating Procedures and training in relation to the use of both will also be implemented.</p>  <p>  On the issue of overcrowding, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department is undertaking a number of actions regarding the consideration of the greater use of alternatives to imprisonment. In addition, the Director General of the IPS is committed to ensuring that any person committed to custody is, in so far as possible, provided with a permanent bed in a prison cell. To achieve this, and ensure the effective management of the increasing prisoner population, the Director General has developed a Prison Population Management Plan in 2019 aimed at maximising capacity within the estate, increasing the use of open centres and the use of back door strategies including structured temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service has also conducted a full cell audit across the Prisons Estate, which included an examination of the capacity of cellular accommodation in accordance with minimum standards for multiple occupancy. As a result, approximately 135 additional beds were introduced which includes 60 in Wheatfield, 30 in the Midlands, and 40 in the D&oacute;chas Centre.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Capital Strategy 2016-2021 outlines plans for the complete replacement of the outdated accommodation in Limerick and Portlaoise prisons as well as improvements across a number of other prisons. On completion of the Limerick and Portlaoise projects, &ldquo;slopping out&rdquo; will be completely eliminated across the prisons estate. Prior to the Budget the IPS had a capital allocation for 2021 of &euro;21 million. The allocation of an additional  &euro;15 million brings the total allocation for this project in 2021 to &euro;36 million. This will be sufficient to complete the Limerick Prison redevelopment project. </p>  <p>  The CPT report also notes that a small number of prison staff are inclined to use excessive force. I am advised by the Director General that the IPS is committed to ensuring that the use of force by staff is restricted to situations or circumstances where is it deemed reasonable and necessary and that a number of safeguards are in place to ensure staff operate within the necessary procedures and rules.  I understand that staff regularly receive updated training on de-escalation and the use of physical force as part of their annual Continuous Professional Development training. </p>  <p>  While it is worth noting that the CPT report states that an accused person&rsquo;s right of access to a lawyer  &ldquo;&hellip;continues to operate in a satisfactory manner as from the very outset of custody.&rdquo;,  it is also noted that the Committee recommends this right is put on a statutory basis. My Department is preparing additional legislative safeguards for the provision of legal representation in new legislation on police powers of search, arrest and detention. It is intended that this new Bill will provide for the right to have a legal representative present during questioning.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that we have committed in the programme for Government to ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT)  before the end of 2021. In that regard, a single National Preventative Mechanism for the Justice Sector will be introduced to include Garda stations, courts, prisons, places of transport and transit between Garda stations, prisons and courts.  To this end, the General Scheme of the Places of Detention Bill is being drafted with a view to securing Government approval in early 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that this Government and the IPS are fully committed to implementing the longer-term changes required to make our penal system safe, effective and responsive to the needs of all prisoners, especially vulnerable persons. While there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system. </p></reply>

We are continuously working to ensure that we have robust legislation, policies and infrastructure that can support and assist victims and hold perpetrators to account. We are also working proactively to raise awareness in society about domestic abuse and sexual violence and are working to change attitudes towards all forms of unacceptable behaviour.</p>  <p>  I am progressing a number of important commitments to ensure that across the board we are responding to the needs of victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence. These include delivering on - </p>  <p>  - The Programme for Government commitment for an audit of how domestic, sexual and gender based violence services are organised to ensure a comprehensive and responsive approach is taken to providing for the needs of victims of domestic abuse;  </p>  <p>  - The review of outstanding action under the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which is a whole of Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters. The outcome of this review will inform the Third National Strategy which is to be adopted before the end of 2021 and which will focus on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. </p>  <p>  - The full and timely implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which is a detailed roadmap for the introduction of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review. These recommendation,  when implemented, will protect and support vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. </p>  <p>  - The continuation of campaigns to raise public awareness of sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence in order to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with a view to decreasing and preventing this type of behaviour and violence.</p>  <p>  - Increased funding to support victims of crime and to raise awareness and combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence  This year I have secured funding of  &euro;4.104 million to support victims of crime and some &euro;3 million for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 for implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey.</p>  <p>  - The continuation of the additional covid specific resources, support, enforcement and services for key organisations working to provide support services to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence during the pandemic and the continued prioritisation by frontline services of domestic abuse incidents. </p>  <p>  - A major National Sexual Violence Prevalence Study, to look in detail at the experience of women and men victims of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large scale surveys every decade to be conducted by the CSO. This detailed and repeated study will ensure we have robust evidence to assist and drive Government policy. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance.</p></reply>

Each case is examined in detail on its individual merits, taking all factors into account. </p>  <p>  My objective is to have decisions on international protection applications and permission to remain considerations made as soon as is possible. This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security. </p>  <p>  During the early stages of the pandemic, it was decided to issue only positive recommendations in respect of International Protection applicants. The aim of this approach was to ensure applicants with negative recommendations were not disadvantaged by the time limits set out in the legislation within which they must make an appeal or request a review of a refusal of permission to remain. Once substantive processing and appeal hearings recommenced in more recent months, so too did the issuing of negative decisions. While the number of negative decisions did not increase, there was a build-up in the issuing of such decisions, with a higher volume than normal issuing once processing recommenced.</p>  <p>  For those found not to be in need of international protection, a detailed consideration of all aspects of their case will have been carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order. This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues. </p>  <p>  When a person receives a letter informing them of their negative international protection decision and informing them that they no longer have permission to remain in the State, they are required to confirm within 5 days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which my Department will provide assistance.  To be clear, the person is not required to remove themselves from the State within 5 days &ndash; they are required to indicate an intent to do so. The time taken for relevant voluntary return arrangements to be made will take into account all factors, including Covid-19 restrictions and limitations to travel this has created. </p>  <p>  For the duration of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, I asked my officials to review the issuing of the letters; and no refusal letters, or letters enclosing a deportation order, have issued to anyone who has been unsuccessful in seeking international protection since. The pragmatic approach to deportation orders will continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>If a Deportation Order is subsequently made, s.3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice. In making a 3(11) revocation request a person should raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin. I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-10a.145.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000064#WRC02600"><p>In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks can take a considerable period of time with the result in some applications taking longer than the average timescale. </p><p>At the end of October there were 23,187 applications being processed at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony due to current public health guidance. </p><p>It is very likely that a significant proportion of these applications would have progressed to completion during 2020 if it had been possible for citizenship ceremonies to go ahead.  My Department did not suspend the receipt or processing of applications at any stage during restrictions, although processing rates have been negatively impacted by health and safety related restrictions.</p><p>The breakdown of applications by length of time open is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Length of time open</th>       <th>No. of applications</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>les than 6 months</td>       <td>4,625 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 -12 months</td>       <td>5,304 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 - 18 months</td>       <td>4,677 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18 - 24 months</td>       <td>3,202 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>more than 24 months</td>       <td>5,379 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>23,187 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.</p><p>Additionally a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 12 months.  A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays last year. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 restrictions which have impacted the delivery of normal services to date this year. The combined impact of the Jones judgement and the COVID-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.</p><p>I recently announced that citizenship ceremonies will be temporarily replaced,  while COVID-19 restrictions are in place, with a requirement for citizenship applicants to sign an affidavit declaring loyalty to the State. It is intended that the regulations will be finalised in the coming weeks and information on the new requirements will be posted on the Immigration Service website at that time.</p><p>It is also my intention that in-person citizenship ceremonies will recommence as soon as circumstances allow.</p><p>In addition to the provision of an alternative to large-scale citizenship ceremonies, work is well advanced on the following measures designed to deal with the current unprecedented level of demand being witnessed: </p><p>- Additional staffing is being assigned to the Citizenship Division and is expected to be in place by year&rsquo;s end. Attendant to this development, restructuring of the organisational structure of the Division is currently underway to ensure optimal customer service delivery.</p><p>- The Citizenship website has been significantly revised with a view to increasing clarity and enhancing the end user experience. As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; has just been introduced. This will provide users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and is called Tara. The application will mimic real-time text or message exchange with a member of staff.</p><p>Plans for the digitisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with my recent announcement to significantly modernise the justice sector through increased digital and ICT investment.

It is intended that the Bill will provide a robust statutory framework for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s use of recording devices and will ensure that necessary safeguards are in place in relation to data obtained through the use of any such devices.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants awarded totalling more than &euro;752,000. </p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that once the new legislation proposed on Digital Recordings has been enacted, a review of the terms and conditions of the scheme will be carried out in the first half of 2021, to bring it into line with this new legislation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, community-based CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006. This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant Local Authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country. </p></reply>

These are now scheduled into dates in January to March of 2021. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that there is ongoing contact between officials from the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure a proactive approach is taken to target those involved in the drugs trade which fuels the activities of organised criminals.  I am assured that the occurrence and prevalence of crime and anti-social behaviour, including drug dealing, is constantly monitored at national and local level by Garda management to ensure that appropriate policing responses are designed and delivered as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau has lead responsibility in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland and is supported by Divisional Drugs Units, which tackle drug related crime on a local basis throughout the country.  I am informed that Divisional Drug Units are now established in every Garda Division.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also remains committed to tackling the supply of drugs by supporting local communities through various preventative and detection initiatives and engagement with local and regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and Projects; the Garda Schools Programme; the Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing For a.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had significant successes in targeting the drugs trade.  In 2020 alone we have witnessed a series of very significant drugs seizures, as well as important seizures of firearms and significant banking information.  In fact, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Annual Report 2019 has been published this week and I note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na successfully seized over &euro;21m in drugs, prevented 14 assassinations and seized 18 firearms in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.  The CSO produces these statistics using data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system and makes regular releases under reservation in relation to various crime statistics, including recorded and detected crime.  The CSO also continues to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  I can inform the Deputy that the official crime statistics from the CSO for the third quarter of 2020 are due to be published later this month and I look forward to reviewing these once available.  </p>  <p>While the most recent crime statistics for the year to Q2 2020 showed an increase of 13.5% in controlled drugs offences in comparison to the preceding year, it should be acknowledged that this is reflective of the increased number of Garda&iacute; on the frontline and the concentrated work of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.   </p></reply>

Prisoners are a recognised vulnerable group for a number of reasons including their general levels of health, age and addictions issues and an outbreak of Covid-19 in a prison could have potentially devastating consequences. </p>  <p>  Every effort has been made by the IPS to continue physical visits during this pandemic however, following Government and NPHET advice it was necessary to suspend physical visits to prisons, firstly in March and more recently in October.  The Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and in that regard a new video visit system was introduced which has allowed families to continue to support those in custody during this time. </p>  <p>  All prisoners are entitled to one 20 minute video visit per week to nominated family and friends. The feedback from prisoners has been very positive as the visit allows people to connect with their families in their homes. The feedback from families has also been positive as it allows families to continue to support prisoners without having to make long journeys to prison to avail of a visit. The IPS introduced a support line to provide information to families on how to connect to the video visit and assist with any connection difficulties. The Prison Service fully appreciate how important contact with family and friends are to people in custody. When physical visits recommence, the Service will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners. </p>  <p>  A number of useful guides and videos have also been developed, in a number of languages, and these are available on the Prison Service website. </p>  <p>  It was the case that some family members were visiting prisoners in order to lodge money to the prisoner&rsquo;s account for their use in the prison tuck shop however, the IPS has introduced a number of new methods for the electronic transfer of money making it much easier for families. </p>  <p>  I am advised that in addition to video visits,  additional phone calls have been also been facilitated for prisoners to allow them to keep in contact with loved ones. In this regard the Prison Service is granting an additional daily phone call to all those in custody during the Christmas period. </p>  <p>  While these are important initiatives I recognise that physical visits are hugely important to prisoners and their families and I am pleased to advise that the IPS has announced that arrangements have been made to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between the 16th December and the 6th of January. </p>  <p>  Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit during the period, which will be 15 minutes in duration. In order to ensure that visits are conducted as safely as possible, visits will be limited to two people of which one may be a child.  The risk posed by Covid-19 still remains therefore in order to prevent the potential spread of infection all visits will be behind clear screens and visitors and prisoners will be required to wear a face mask at all times. No physical contact between prisoners and family members will be permitted.</p>  <p>  The normal security screening procedures will be in place however, all visitors will also be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedure including having their temperature taken. Visitors are asked not to attend the prison if they have any Covid-19 symptoms, have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing for the virus or is a confirmed case or have been abroad in the proceeding 14 days. </p>  <p>  The IPS have asked that  all packages and mail reaches the prison no later than December 10th 2020 to ensure that it reaches loved ones before Christmas. Due to Covid-19 infection control restrictions all mail must be quarantined for a period before being delivered to the person who is to receive it. This, added to the normal security arrangement for screening mail, means that any letter or card sent to prisons this year should be sent as early as possible.</p></reply>

The team is working actively to progress the selection of the board members, the appointment of a chief executive and of staff, the development of legal processes and a legal aid scheme, as well as securing an appropriate premises for the new body and a project board has been established in my Department to oversee this important work. </p>  <p>  The Government has supported this commitment with funding allocated for the Parole Board for 2021 of &euro;1.3 million, which is more than double previous allocations. This substantial increase will allow for the implementation of the model of parole as envisaged under the Parole Board Act.</p>  <p>  The new statutory parole board will considerably improve the system as it currently operates. As mentioned, the Parole Act 2019 puts the parole board on an independent statutory footing and it sets out clear and transparent criteria for how the board will reach its decisions, which will be independent of the Minister of the day. </p>  <p>  The Act also increases the length of the sentence which must be served by life sentenced prisoners before they are even eligible to be considered for parole, from 7 to 12 years.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I feel it is important to note that while under the current system prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment for murder are eligible to come before the Parole Board after 7 years imprisonment, in reality over the past 10 years, the average sentence served before a life sentenced prisoner is released on parole, is eighteen years, and in 2019 it was 20 years. </p>  <p>  While the model set out in the Parole Act 2019 is complex, and requires a significant amount of planning to allow for its establishment, including detailed preparatory work to analyse and document the new legal processes that will give effect to the provisions of the Act, the work already done and the significant increase in funding allocated under Budget 2021 will allow the project board to take its work forward and move from the planning to the implementation phase of the 2019 Act. </p>  <p>  To support this work further, additional staff have been assigned to implement this project on a priority basis, in addition to the seven existing Parole Board staff who will continue to support the existing board.</p>  <p>  A critical path for delivery of this significant priority project is currently being developed with a view to ensuring full commencement of the Parole Act, which will be achieved in 2021.</p></reply>

The 1941 and 1945 Acts currently provide compensation in respect of death or injury which is maliciously inflicted upon a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while on duty or in connection with their duties. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that An Garda Sioch&aacute;na operates an absence management process with an overarching goal to understand and address absence across the organisation and proactively support those on sick absence.  The process is owned and managed at District level for Garda members and at Divisional level for Civilian staff.  Consistent communication channels are put in place to ensure contact maintained with individuals off sick for more than 14 days.  An Garda Siochana uses Occupational health programmes to support individuals and promote good health. Back to work interviews are conducted with individuals off sick and injured for more than 5 consecutive days or 3 single days in a roster/ 28 day period.  </p>  <p>  Those who experience traumatic injuries are encouraged to engage with the Employee Assistance Service within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which provides a confidential professional support service to both serving and retired personnel of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, students, reserves and their families.  It is a proactive response by the organisation to support personnel in managing and resolving work and/or personal difficulties, such as injuries sustained in the line of duty, at an early stage which will assist them in maintaining their health and wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The service is available to help resolve work and/or personal issues, including mental health, which may be causing stress, worry or disruption to an individual&rsquo;s life.  The Service is under the remit of Human Resources and People Development, and managed by a Superintendent. There are 16 full time staff attached to the unit. Each Employee Assistance Officer has completed a Diploma in Employee Assistance and Social Support delivered by NUI Galway. </p>  <p>  The Employee Assistance Service is supported by a Peer Supporter Network.  Peer Supporters are colleagues who have received appropriate training in helping members cope with the effect of a traumatic incident in the workplace. </p>  <p>Since June 24th   2016, a 24/7, 365 Independent Helpline and Counselling Service is available to all staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This service is available for both work and personal difficulties.  The service is provided by Inspire Wellbeing and is confidential, free and self-referral.</p>  <p>  Under the most recent contract awarded to Inspire Wellbeing, a new 2 tier system is available which includes:</p>  <p>  - Solution Focus Based Therapy for life and work events</p>  <p>  - Trauma Focussed based Counselling, delivered by qualified trauma counsellors </p>  <p>  The mental health of members and Garda staff is vitally important.  Between September and December 2018 approximately 88 personnel in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were trained in &ldquo;Mental Health First Aid Ireland&rdquo;. This training was delivered by St John of Gods in conjunction with the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Garda organisation is conscious of the need to provide support to all staff  particularly  in the complex area of modern policing and therefore the supports structures are continuously reviewed to ensure they meet the needs of the membership.</p></reply>

Work is at an advanced stage on legislative measures to contribute to delivery on the Government's commitments under the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, the Government signed an International Agreement with the British Government on the establishment of the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR).  The ICIR will be a cross-border institution which will be established to receive information on troubles-related deaths and to prepare a report on the circumstances of the death for the families of the victims.  The development of proposals for legislation to establish the ICIR in this jurisdiction is being progressed, but the ICIR will require legislation to be enacted in both jurisdictions with parallel provisions in order for it to come into effect.</p>  <p>   In July 2019, the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 2019 was enacted. The legislation is an important step in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agreed measures to address the legacy of the troubles on the island of Ireland and to support the victims of the conflict and their families. The Act facilitates co-operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the legacy framework in Northern Ireland. In addition to enhancing the co-operation being provided to ongoing Coroners&rsquo; Inquests in Northern Ireland into historical deaths, the legislation further underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to full co-operation with the framework of measures set out in the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>   As the Deputy will appreciate, efforts to advance the Stormont House Agreement legacy provisions have been affected by the political stalemate in Northern Ireland which lasted until January of this year and by the UK Government&rsquo;s announcement on legacy in March. Nevertheless, this Government remains committed to the Stormont House framework as the way forward on legacy issues and will continue to engage with our UK and Northern Ireland counterparts.  </p></reply>

We are continuously working to ensure that we have robust legislation, policies and infrastructure that can support and assist victims and hold perpetrators to account. We are also working proactively to raise awareness in society about domestic abuse and sexual violence and are working to change attitudes towards all forms of unacceptable behaviour.</p>  <p>  I am progressing a number of important commitments to ensure that across the board we are responding to the needs of victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence. These include delivering on - </p>  <p>  - The Programme for Government commitment for an audit of how domestic, sexual and gender based violence services are organised to ensure a comprehensive and responsive approach is taken to providing for the needs of victims of domestic abuse;  </p>  <p>  - The review of outstanding action under the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence which is a whole of Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters. The outcome of this review will inform the Third National Strategy which is to be adopted before the end of 2021 and which will focus on prevention and reduction and will include a National Preventative Strategy. </p>  <p>  - The full and timely implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which is a detailed roadmap for the introduction of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review. These recommendation,  when implemented, will protect and support vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. </p>  <p>  - The continuation of campaigns to raise public awareness of sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence in order to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with a view to decreasing and preventing this type of behaviour and violence.</p>  <p>  - Increased funding to support victims of crime and to raise awareness and combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence  This year I have secured funding of  &euro;4.104 million to support victims of crime and some &euro;3 million for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 for implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey. </p>  <p>  - The continuation of the additional covid specific resources, support, enforcement and services for key organisations working to provide support services to victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence during the pandemic and the continued prioritisation by frontline services of domestic abuse incidents. </p>  <p>  - A major National Sexual Violence Prevalence Study, to look in detail at the experience of women and men victims of sexual violence and abuse in Ireland, with repeat large scale surveys every decade to be conducted by the CSO. This detailed and repeated study will ensure we have robust evidence to assist and drive Government policy. </p>  <p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance.</p></reply>

While a number of significant reforms have been made, I fully accept that there are still a number of long standing issues which need more work to be resolved and I understand this is where the focus must be. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, one area highlighted by the Committee for immediate attention is how the complex needs of people with mental health difficulties who come into contact with the criminal justice system are provided for. The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the me as Minister for Justice and for Minister Donnelly. </p>  <p>  It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental / cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. </p>  <p>  In order to progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted Task Force with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.</p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the system should have access to comprehensive mental health support, the Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. </p>  <p>  This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Committee made specific recommendations in relation to the challenges arising in the management of people in the care of the Irish Prison Service in D2 wing in Cloverhill prison.  I understand that Wing D2 in Cloverhill is one of the more challenging areas within the prison system and accommodates some of the most vulnerable prisoners in the care of the IPS. </p>  <p>  As you may be aware, I have regular engagement with the Director on all aspects of the implementation of Government policies and strategies across the Penal system.  I have been assured by the Irish Prison Service that significant efforts are made by the prison staff working there to ensure that the prisoners in their care are treated with dignity and respect. </p>  <p>  In that regard, I think it&rsquo;s only fair to acknowledge the very positive comments made by the Committee, in their preliminary report published in the aftermath of their visit in 2019, regarding what they saw as the overall high level of care provided by prison staff to prisoners which left the Committee with the impression that there is a genuine concern among staff for those in custody.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I accept that we do need to rise to the challenges and I am committed to delivering solutions to address the acute and complex needs of vulnerable prisoners in our custody. </p>  <p>  While there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system. </p></reply>

The audit will be undertaken by an external consultant with meaningful involvement from relevant NGOs and service providers, as well as input from Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and a procurement process to engage an independent person to undertake the audit has commenced with details available on my Department's website (www.justice.ie). It is intended that the audit will be completed within 3 months of commissioning and the findings will be presented to Government before the end of March 2021 in line with the PfG commitment. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that, over the last decade, work in this area has been conducted through successive DSGBV strategies. My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. </p>  <p>  The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.  The Monitoring Committee and the NGOs represented on it are key partners for my Department in our work to tackle DSGBV and will be a primary focus of our consultations in the audit process. I can confirm for the Deputy that the organisation referred to is a member of the Monitoring Committee. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  As part of our national response to domestic abuse, in 2020, my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of crime, including victims of sexual and gender based violence.  These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. I have secured &euro;4.104 million under Budget 2021 to continue supporting victims of crime.  I have also secured just over &euro;3 million for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p>  <p>  &lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo; will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has already started, and I expect this training will be further rolled out in 2021.</p>  <p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete nationwide with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and expert assistance.  </p></reply>

For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions.  </p>  <p>  In September, Minister Donnelly and I announced that &euro;7.5 million is being made available in 2020 to increase disability day services by one day a week for 14,940 adults. I also secured funding under the Budget to maintain this increase in 2021.  </p>  <p>  The funding will be used to augment staffing levels so that  adults that currently live at home with their families will receive an average of an additional day of service at a day service location over and above what they have been receiving since day services resumed in August. Chief Officers were asked to immediately progress plans with the service provider sector to expedite the recruitment of the staff in this regard.</p></reply>

Some correspondents have expressed concern over a potential increase in self-harm, suicide and increased anxiety in the general population.</p>  <p>  While early information suggests that there has not been a significant increase in self-harm and suicide figures, this is an area that the Department of Health will continue to monitor. It should be noted that the most recent year for which we have confirmed suicide figures is 2016, as coroners' reports and late registrations must be included. Provisional figures for 2019 are available.</p>  <p>  I am aware, however, that traffic to online counselling sites has increased. </p>  <p>  This is the case, for example, with MyMind, which is a HSE partner NGO providing online counselling sessions. Funding of &euro;2.2m has been provided for 2020 to ensure that we can meet this increased demand through MyMind and a number of other providers.</p>  <p>  It is important to promote the availability of these services. In this regard, the HSE has, since October, conducted an awareness campaign, through radio advertisements, directing people who need services to yourmentalhealth.ie and the mental health information telephone line 1800 111 888.</p>  <p>  I recognise that the Covid pandemic may increase anxiety levels among the general population. The Government campaigns, &ldquo;In this Together&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo;, which encourage and offer practical advice on keeping our physical and mental health well, have helped to deal with this issue. In this regard, the results of the recent Amarach tracker survey, which measures emotional well-being, showed slight improvement in terms of anxiety, from 40% in October to 31% at end-November.</p>  <p>  We do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health, the extent of subsequent supports that may be required and how this will affect longer term demand for services. However, the HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need. The Department and HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity, subject to public health advice.</p></reply>

Students on placements are learning through participation in practice and care delivery, under the supervision of qualified staff. They develop the practical knowledge, clinical skills and professional values required to meet the education standards for qualification and to become a registered practitioner.</p>  <p>  This is the same in many European countries that have graduate nursing programmes. </p>  <p>  Both Nursing and Midwifery are graduate professions must achieve academic, clinical and professional learning requirements to meet educational standards, as set by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Supernumerary status means that the student is in the clinical area but additional to the staffing numbers required for that area. Students work under supervision and alongside qualified staff who have undertaken specific training to support them in the clinical area. Students do not have responsibility for patient caseloads on supernumerary placements, though they can participate in the delivery of care. </p>  <p>  The clinical experience required by student nurses and midwives is gained via the supervised care of patients. </p>  <p>  Supernumerary status is critical for learning in complex environments. This places them on the frontline in a learning capacity. </p>  <p>  During the 4th year Internship placement student nurses and midwives are no longer supernumerary. They remain under supervision and are considered equivalent to 0.5 WTE. This ensures a lighter patient case load for students and to avoid reducing the qualified nursing compliment, which has increased by 1,404 since last December. </p></reply>

The medical practitioner must certify this opinion and three days must elapse between certification and the procedure being carried out. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, sections 9 and 10 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 set out other grounds on which termination of pregnancy is permitted in this country. Section 9 requires that two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; the foetus has not reached viability; and it is appropriate to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert the risk concerned.  One of the two medical practitioners must be an obstetrician; and the other must be an appropriate medical practitioner, and both must certify their opinions in order for the termination to be carried out. </p>  <p>  Section 10 deals with emergency situations. It provides that a termination of pregnancy may be carried out by a medical practitioner who, having examined the pregnant woman, is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is an immediate risk to the life or of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, and it is immediately necessary to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert that risk. </p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to intervene in medical practice to suggest how medical practitioners treat their patients, or to dictate the practice of obstetrics. Medical practitioners are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to operate in accordance with best medical practice. </p>  <p>  Clinical guidelines for the provision of termination of pregnancy services, within the legal framework set out in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, have been developed by the relevant professional medical bodies. </p>  <p>  There is regular ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.</p></reply>

However, the reality is that, while very regrettable, these restrictions have been necessary to protect the safety of patients and families, hospital staff and the operability of our maternity services. </p>  <p>  To date, thankfully, no maternal deaths linked to Covid-19 have been recorded in Ireland.  This coupled with the fact, that we have had a low incidence in pregnant women, suggests that the measures taken by maternity services to protect women, have been successful.  </p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has issued guidance regarding attendance at acute hospitals during the pandemic, including attendance at maternity hospitals.  The guidance advises that restrictions on partner visiting; accompanying persons in labour; or parents visiting neonatal intensive care units, should be based on a documented risk assessment that is regularly reviewed. </p>  <p>  In that context, and in an attempt to ensure the greatest consistency of service  across our maternity units, the HSE is now re-classifying partners as an &lsquo;essential companion&rsquo; for the purpose of fetal anomaly or anatomy scans.  I am advised that the HSE is currently finalising guidance for maternity hospitals in this matter; the expectation is that from next week, partners&rsquo; attendance at antenatal scanning will be facilitated, where possible., having regard to overall patient and staff safety.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to emphasise that if a case of Covid-19 is linked to a maternity unit, Public Health teams will undertake a public health risk assessment, and it may be necessary to re-introduce restrictions. Of course, responses and recommendations for each maternity unit may differ, depending on the facilities and circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, notwithstanding the relaxation of the restrictions in place, there will be a need to ensure that the safety of women, their partners and hospital staff is protected.  Maternity services are a core, essential service and the focus must be to protect services to ensure we are able to continue to provide 24/7 care.</p></reply>

At this time, it was necessary to redeploy existing staff to areas most urgently affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as testing and contact tracing. </p>  <p>  A dedicated testing and tracing workforce is currently being recruited to allow for redeployed staff to return to their original posts. Significant progress is being made to recruit swabbing staff with 3,451 applications received and 503 appointed to date with an anticipated maximum of a further 130 by year end. Onboarding will continue each week until we have a dedicated workforce of 1,000 in swabbing.</p>  <p>  With regards to candidates who applied for the &lsquo;Be on Call for Ireland&rsquo; initiative, any candidate who remained subscribed to this initiative was notified by email of the Community Swabber recruitment campaign, and individuals could make a decision to apply for it, in line with eligibility criteria for Community Swabber. Candidates appointed from this recruitment initiative are now working in COVID-19 testing centres throughout the country.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a need to redeploy staff from across the public and civil sector to areas with urgent service demands.  These workers were redeployed to roles in which they had the skillset required. </p>  <p>  The work of Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists and other health and social professionals is essential.  Indeed, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all those who work across these different disciplines for their invaluable contribution to the provision of both Covid and non-Covid care during this most difficult year.</p>  <p>  The fact is that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity in primary care, and this has impacted on waiting lists which is a concern shared by Deputies on all sides of the House.  I am pleased to report that monthly activity across primary care therapy services is now far ahead of what it was in April as therapists and other professionals return to their core roles and service innovations such as digital or telehealth technologies help boost capacity.</p></reply>

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The HSE has however a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department and has been published. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. </p>  <p>  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised a work programme which has been initiated and which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.

The principles of Sl&aacute;intecare, such as the patient being paramount; timely, needs-based care; prevention and public health; and engagement with citizens and staff, were clearly demonstrated through the COVID-19 response. </p><p>Important lessons have been learnt from COVID-19 and applied to the ongoing implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare throughout the service. In particular, the telehealth access to GP services for COVID-19 symptoms, the integration of services across acute and community, the focus on managing as much care as possible in the community and the rapid deployment of e-health solutions illustrate what is possible and the extent to which the pandemic response has helped to demonstrate in practice the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. </p><p>Key programmes that have progressed during 2020 include commencing the implementation of improving <b>population health-based planning</b>and developing <b>new models of care</b>to deliver <b>more effective and integrated care,</b>especially in relation to:</p><p>- Innovative integration programmes that support people to live independently at home, promote self-empowerment, and have a focus on preventing illness, across 122 sites all around the country;</p><p>- 96 Sl&aacute;intecare Community Healthcare Networks based on populations of 50,000 people, and Specialist Hubs for Older People;</p><p>- the agreement with General Practice to deliver a national Chronic Disease Management (CDM)Programme; and</p><p>- Patient Prescriptions e-Scripts between GPs and Pharmacies through the secure Healthmail system. Since mid-April, almost 900,000 prescription messages were sent through the platform with over 550,000 messages in the month of May alone, averaging almost 20,000 prescriptions per day.</p><p>The new context has provided opportunities for implementing Sl&aacute;intecare at pace, and the very large investment in Sl&aacute;intecare for 2021 will support this. Three priority programmes have been identified to drive Sl&aacute;intecare implementation at pace, with a focus on the next three years:</p><p>1. Keeping people well at home or near home, out of hospital, living independent lives, by implementing agreed end to end care pathways between GPs, Community and Hospital services, through Community Healthcare Networks and Specialist Hubs and a variety of related projects.  Healthy Ireland is a key enabler of this programme.</p><p>2. Helping achieve waiting list targets, through implementing the Capacity/Access Plan including devising a multiannual waiting list plan and commissioning ambulatory-elective centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p><p>3. Devising a Citizen Care Masterplan for universal eligibility and multi-annual funding using a population-based planning, segmentation, needs and gap analysis approach, by Region, supported by five frameworks:1) clinical governance, 2) workforce planning, 3) capital planning, 4) eligibility/entitlement, 5) funding.</p><p>Budget 2021 allocated &euro;1.353 billion specifically to Sl&aacute;intecare-related initiatives, including &euro;467 million for increased acute and community bed capacity, &euro;425 million to provide enhanced community, social and primary care services and &euro;318 million to improve access to care. In addition, the investment will provide for an increase of approximately 16,000 additional staff in the health service, 5 million more hours for home care, and allocations of &euro;100 million for disability services, &euro;50 million for mental health services, &euro;153 million for eHealth and &euro;20 million for Healthy Ireland. </p><p>The allocation demonstrates the strong commitment by Government to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision and will enhance the permanent capacity of the health services, substantially increase the workforce, expanding the scale and range of service to be provided in the community and introduce targeted measures to improve access to care in 2021. </p></reply>

Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals and the HSE was agreed at the end of March. In the interests of transparency, a copy of the Heads of Terms to the Agreement, which sets out the broad terms of the arrangement, was laid before the Oireachtas last April. It is not proposed to publish the details of arrangements with individual hospitals as that information is commercially sensitive and as such to publish it would be a breach of the Heads of Terms to the Agreement.  The agreement provided that the HSE would secure 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June. The final costs of the arrangement are still subject to verification. However, it is estimated that the costs arising from the agreement will be in the region of &euro;305 million euros. </p>  <p>  Under the agreement, payment to the private hospitals was on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals were reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs covered were limited to normal costs of operating the hospital. The hospitals will only receive their actual operating costs when these have been verified. The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there is an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement. At the time of the agreement it was determined that the cost only open book model was the most effective way of ensuring the arrangement was value for money for the State.  </p>  <p>  Following termination of the private hospital agreement in June, the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity to cover three areas:</p>  <p>  - To secure a safety net arrangement against the potential of a further surge of Covid-19 cases;</p>  <p>  - Capacity arising from the need to run the public hospitals in a Covid-19 environment; and</p>  <p>  - To secure elective activity to assist with waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Discussions are still ongoing between the HSE and private hospitals with regard to a safety net arrangement in the event of another surge in Covid-19 cases. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE is in the final stage of a procurement process to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostics from private providers which is required to address some of the anticipated shortfall over the next two years. A panel will be put in place, following which each hospital will run mini competitions for the services they need. In the meantime, the Department has approved a HSE temporary arrangement for the treatment of patients in private hospitals.</p>  <p>  In terms of broader hospital capacity the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  This winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the uncertainty around the level of Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare demands. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds from the baseline at the start of 2020. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p></reply>

This has included:</p><p>- A focus on building an enabling environment for cross-sectoral and collaborative action, supported by a stakeholder engagement and communications strategy.</p><p>- Significant cross government and intersectoral partnerships and working has been created by the Framework.</p><p>- A suite of national policies and plans to address risk factors such as obesity, tobacco and physical inactivity have been published, and policy direction across areas such as cancer, maternity care, drugs and mental health has been informed and influenced by Healthy Ireland.</p><p>Notwithstanding the progress to date, there is an urgent need to scale and expand the activity across all strands of the work from Government to local level. To support effective implementation, and to capitalise on further opportunities to involve more sectors in implementation.</p><p>In late 2019 the Health and Wellbeing Unit in my Department commenced the development of a Strategic Action Plan for the next phase of the Healthy Ireland Framework.  Despite the challenges caused by Covid-19, which has caused some delays to the original timeline for this process, significant progress on the development of the Strategic Action Plan for Healthy Ireland has been made.  To date the process has already completed a rapid review of previous progress, extensive stakeholder engagement, a desktop review of other jurisdictions for best practice, and a review of goals for alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Programme for Government.  </p><p>Presently a set of emerging priorities is being considered in partnership with other Government Departments and internally in the Department of Health.  The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan is expected to be finalised in early 2021, for agreement across Government and subsequent publication.</p><p>The Government Plan for Living with COVID-19: Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021 highlighted the important role that individual and community resilience is playing in contributing to our ongoing response to COVID-19.  Since its initiation seven years ago, Healthy Ireland has progressed the implementation of an all-of-Government approach to improving and supporting the health and wellbeing of the people of Ireland.  Through strong partnerships with a multitude of bodies, Healthy Ireland provides direction and focus to support individuals, communities, local authorities and national organisations to engage in initiatives and activities that support health and wellbeing.  With its existing links to Local Authorities and local community activation, the Healthy Ireland Fund provides the mechanism to allocate resources to support the community resilience campaign at local level.</p><p>At the heart of the Keep Well campaign is helping people - individuals &amp;amp; communities - to keep up their resilience &amp;amp; wellbeing through an especially challenging winter and through to spring.  People are being encouraged to plan some &ldquo;self-care&rdquo; every day or week to get them through the winter and are being supported with information and resources to help them to do so.  The campaign is focused on five major themes:</p><p><b>- Keeping active</b>- keeping active and being outdoors, even during the winter, is important to help physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p><p><b>- Staying connected - </b>staying connected with people, addressing isolation, supporting volunteerism and initiatives that support person-to-person connection is important to our wellbeing.</p><p><b>- Switching off and being creative</b>- switching off and being creative or learning something new, getting back to nature and finding ways to relax can help our general wellbeing.</p><p><b>- Eating well - </b>by nourishing your body and mind we can develop a better connection between the food we eat and how we feel and positively impact our physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p><b>- Minding your mood</b>&ndash; equipping people with information on where to go if they need support. This will also be linked with the local community helpline to ensure that people can access the support they need.</p><p>A series of initiatives is being rolled out under these themes, continuing into spring 2021.  It is our intent that the partnerships that have been forged in responding to the challenge of Covid-19 across Government and society will be maintained in the future work towards the vision of a Healthy Ireland.</p></reply>

Students train under supervision and  alongside qualified staff who have undertaken additional preceptorship training to support them in the clinical area. Students do not have responsibility for patient case loads while on supernumerary placements. While students may participate in the delivery of care, the supernumerary status  ensures supported learning, essential  for students in gaining the range of skills and experience needed for qualification.  </p><p>Financial supports for non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Circular 9/2004, that provides:</p><p>- an accommodation allowance up to &euro;50.79 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from their normal place of residence;</p><p>- a refund of travel expenses.</p><p>Both are paid as refunds on production of receipts. </p><p>Concerning 4<sup>th</sup>year nursing and midwifery students, the HSE continues to fund the internship employment of these students who are on rostered work placements. This includes those due to commence rostered work placement in January 2021. These 4<sup>th</sup>year student nurses and midwives on rostered work placement are paid at the approved rate, that is &euro;22,229 on an annual basis for psychiatric nursing specialism and &euro;21,749 for all other nursing disciplines. This rate of pay is determined by HSE circular 005/2016 and is updated in accordance with the consolidated pay scales issued on 01<sup>st</sup>October, 2020 by my Department. Other healthcare students do unpaid clinical placements in order to qualify. 4th year student nurses on rostered internship placement are the only healthcare students who are paid a salary.  </p><p>Last week, I wrote to the Nursing Unions and advised of the supports made available in 2020 for student nurses and student midwives. These include:</p><p>- Access to PUP payment for those student nurses and midwives who may have lost part time employment due to COVID-19. This is a specific exemption for nurses and midwives for which I have secured Government approval;</p><p>- Enhanced Illness benefit for those students who work part time but have fallen ill with COVID-19;</p><p>- Other welfare schemes to assist with financial hardship due to illness, subject to qualifying criteria (Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Urgent Needs Payment);</p><p>- Access for eligible students to the National Access Plan (Contingency Fund) and Student Assistance Fund.</p><p>- &euro;250 top-up for those in receipt of the SUSI grant or &euro;250 contribution to fees for eligible students.</p><p>A review of student allowances has been completed by my Department and after consideration of the findings, I have instructed that the current travel and accommodation allowance rates be subject to a focused re-examination, in the form of a time limited process which shall be subject to an independent appraisal and concluded no later than 5<sup>th</sup>January 2021. My Department is engaging with the representative organisations on this matter.</p></reply>

The number of staff employed by the Health Service Executive is identified through the staff census, which is collected monthly, with October being the most recently available data. </p>  <p>  From the end of September to the end of October, there has been a net increase of 92 WTE. However, it is important to note that the monthly change has been impacted by the changes in nursing and midwifery students moving from their current grade to the grade of Staff Nurse or Midwife, upon graduation. There is a delay between when student nurses and midwives leave the census as one grade and return as a different grade. This move takes place between September and year end. </p>  <p>  In total, 1,030 student nurses and midwives will take up permanent contracts as Staff Nurses and Midwives by the end of this year. Excluding the WTE associated with pre-registration student nurses and midwives, there was a growth of 429 WTE in October.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, there is recruitment taking place that is not reflected in current census figures. In October, 240 community swabbers were recruited. However, they are not currently captured in census figures due to a time delay. In addition, 322 contact tracers were recruited in October, but these staff are not included in the census as they are hired and employed through third party agencies.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  As a result of the significant disruption in scheduled care, hospital waiting lists reached a peak in May. The resumption of services from June onwards has however allowed for increased activity. The numbers of patients awaiting an Inpatient / Daycase procedure dropped by 16% from May to November and the rate of growth in the Outpatient waiting list has slowed in recent months.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to engage with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) on the development of the Access to Care Plan 2021 which will set out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled Care in 2021. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210m of which will be allocated as required to the HSE and &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the provision of treatment in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working on a number of initiatives to improve access to scheduled care and reduce waiting lists in acute hospitals. As part of the overall response to COVID 19, the Convention Centre Facility in City West was taken over by the HSE. The convention centre is supporting a number of scheduled care activities including drive-through Glaucoma pressure testing and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) allergy testing. The HSE is working closely with Hospital Groups and City West to ensure that all potential capacity is being utilised.</p>  <p>  Alternative patient pathways are being developed by the HSE to improve access to appropriate care and alleviate pressures on acute hospital waiting lists. Examples include a new referral to Audiology Services pathway and a national Delivery of Musculoskeletal Service, which aim to ultimately move these services from acute hospitals to a community setting. It is envisioned that the re-design of these patient pathways will have a measurable and positive impact on ENT and Orthopaedic waiting lists.</p>  <p>  With the resumption of routine scheduled care services in June, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) resumed the commissioning of appointments and procedures for patients. The NTPF advise that by the end of October, 24,698 Inpatient/Daycase (IPDC) treatments and 7,648 Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Scopes had been arranged and in terms of Outpatients, they had approved in principal 66,096 Outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  To support access to care in the context of both COVID-19 and winter pressures, the NTPF has been sanctioned to provide Emergency Department Authorisation Notifications (EDANs) which allow acute hospitals to access available diagnostic capacity in both the public and private sectors. EDANS can be used by hospitals to support access to diagnostics for both emergency and scheduled care and provide an alternative pathway to diagnostics. This has been particularly important in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak and the ongoing need to allow for social distancing within the hospitals, which has resulted in reduced capacity in the system. The NTPF have advised that up to the end of October nearly 27,000 EDANs had been utilised.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-10a.407.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000068#WRG02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</p><p>The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was published in 2015 with four primary policy objectives. One of those objectives was for Ireland to reach a consumption rate of 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per capita by 2020. The remaining objectives were to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people, to reduce the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol, and to regulate the supply and price of alcohol in order to minimise the possibility and incidence of alcohol related harm. The Bill was not enacted until October 2018 therefore the time between enactment and the 2020 objective of reducing consumption to 9.1 litres per capita was shorter than was originally anticipated.</p><p>In 2019 alcohol consumption per capita in Ireland was 10.86 litres. This has fallen from the high rate of 14.3 litres per capita in 2001 but levels have remained at approximately 11 litres since 2015 with consumption at 11 litres in 2017, 11.01 litres in 2018 and 10.86 litres in 2019.  </p><p>The Public Health (Alcohol) Act is designed to achieve its objectives through addressing alcohol pricing, labelling, advertising and display.  </p><p>In November 2019, the following substantive provisions on the Act became law:</p><p>- a prohibition on alcohol advertising in or on public service vehicles, at public transport stops or stations and within 200 m of a school, early years centre or a local authority playground.</p><p>- a prohibition on alcohol advertising in a cinema except around films with an 18 classification or in licensed premises within a cinema.</p><p>- a prohibition on children&rsquo;s clothing that promotes alcohol.</p><p>These measures aim to create an environment free from alcohol advertising in areas frequented by children and will ensure that our children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol advertising. </p><p>On 12 November this year, section 22 of the Act, which provides for the separation and visibility of the alcohol products in mixed retail outlets became operational. This recently applicable law means that mixed retail outlets such as supermarkets must confine alcohol products to either:</p><p>- an area separated by a 1.2 metre high barrier, or</p><p>- units in which alcohol products are not visible up to 1.5 metres height, or</p><p>- up to three units that can be a maximum of 1 metre wide by 2.2 metres high.</p><p>In addition, alcohol products can be contained but not be visible in a unit behind the counter.  </p><p>The separation of alcohol products from other grocery products in retail outlets is designed to reduce the likelihood that alcohol products will be on display near grocery products, thereby discouraging their purchase as part of everyday household grocery shopping. In addition, alcohol products will be less visible to children.  </p><p>From 11 January next year, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Products) Regulations will come into force. The purpose of the Regulations is to address the inclusion of alcohol products in price promotion schemes. The Regulations are designed to prohibit:</p><p>- the use of bonus or loyalty card points in relation to alcohol products</p><p>- the sale of alcohol products  at a reduced price when sold with another product or service, and </p><p>- the sale of alcohol productsat a reduced price for a period of 3 days or less. </p><p>Finally, in November next year the following provisions will become law:</p><p>- A prohibition on alcohol advertising on a sports area during a sporting event, at events aimed at children or at events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children.</p><p>- Alcohol sponsorship of events aimed at children, events at which the majority of participants or competitors are children and events involving driving or racing motor vehicles is prohibited.</p><p>Progression of work relating to the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Act, including the drafting of regulations relating to the labelling and advertising of alcohol products, was interrupted in March due to the prioritisation of legislation and other work related to the pandemic.  As set out in the 2013 Government Decision which approved the minimum unit pricing of alcohol products, this measure will be introduced when a similar measure is introduced in Northern Ireland so as to allay concerns that its introduction in one jurisdiction only would impact cross-border trade.</p></reply>

At the Health and Food Safety Sectoral Meeting of the North South Ministerial Council on 2 October we noted the work of the Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT) cross-border health and social care partnership.</p>  <p>  CAWT is an organisation that continues to play a significant role in cross-border co-operation.  The CAWT partners in Northern Ireland are the Health and Social Care Board, the Public Health Agency, the Southern Health and the Western Health and Social Care Trusts. The HSE is the CAWT partner in the South.  </p>  <p>  Through this partnership, the health and social care services in both jurisdictions have been working together in the border region to provide practical solutions to the health and social care needs of local communities since 1992. </p>  <p>  CAWT&rsquo;s primary activity is to support the existing health agencies in the border area in developing collaborative services and to co-ordinate the delivery of European Union INTERREG funded cross-border health and social care projects and services. CAWT led on the health projects for the two Departments North and South for INTERREG IVA; it is also leading on four projects and is partner on one project under the INTERREG V programme. </p>  <p>  CAWT also undertakes cross-border work on behalf of the HSE and the Departments.  I understand that CAWT will also seek to participate in the future Peace Plus Programme, if appropriate.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant activity in cross-border health and social care co-operation over recent decades and CAWT has played an important role in this. I look forward to CAWT's continued participation in North-South collaboration in the coming years.</p></reply>

I have committed to holding a short, time limited independent examination of these allowances in the context of COVID-19. Work is underway to progress this and I envisage that this will be completed by the end of December.   </p>  <p>  Separately, the regular pay for 4th year student nurses employed on rostered internship increased by 2% on 1st October this year. The annualised salary for this group is now &euro;21,749 for general nursing and midwifery and &euro;22,229 for psychiatric nursing.   </p>  <p>  In terms of increasing the number of permanent nurses and midwives, earlier this year the HSE committed to offering permanent contracts to all 2020 nursing graduates. This is welcome news for those entering the nursing profession. In addition, recruitment of more nurses and midwives is continuing. The numbers of nurses and midwives employed in our public health service is up by almost 2,000 WTE in the past two years alone and now stands at 39,608 WTE as at the end of October 2020.   </p>  <p>  The recent Nursing Agreement improved and extended allowances as well as accelerated career progression and development opportunities. It introduced a new Enhanced Nurse Practice Nurse / Midwife role. This role will enable nurses and midwives to practice to the fullest extent of their licence and should help with the recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives in our public health system. The Agreement also includes commitments to further fund the roll out of the Framework on Safe Staffing and Skill Mix in our hospitals. This approach to determining nurse staffing and skill mix is underpinned by evidence and the Government remains committed to the implementation of this initiative.</p></reply>

Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total cost to &euro;1.73 billion.   </p>  <p>  The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the main contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments and is undertaking as assessment of the position in order to assess a revised likely timeframe, bearing in mind the delays that have occurred to date.   </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this stage to forecast the cost implications as the position continues to unfold.   </p>  <p>  As the NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital, I have referred the remaining part of your question regarding the details of the spending to date in 2020 on legal fees to the NPHDB for direct reply.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered free of charge by their GP.  However, the cost of purchasing the vaccine privately is not covered by the medical card.</p></reply>

October 2020.  This work is now being followed by the development of nutrition standards for Early Learning and Care settings.   </p>  <p>  The sub-group on Reformulation has as its priority the setting of targets for food and drink reformulation and a &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo; for reformulation action to achieve those targets.  The draft roadmap is at an advanced stage, and the submission of a report with the targets and roadmap is expected in the near future.   </p>  <p>  Obesity is a priority area for the new Government, and this is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government, "Our Shared Future".  It is also a high priority of mine in my capacity as Minister for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy.  The Obesity Policy and Action Plan is scheduled to run until 2025, and while the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted upon the work of the OPIOG in 2020, the increased funding for Healthy Ireland in Budget  2021 demonstrates redoubled commitment to Healthy Ireland initiatives, including under the Obesity Policy and Action Plan.  Detailed discussions are currently being progressed with partners, particularly in relation to the development of an area-based approach to health and wellbeing in areas of deprivation.  In addition, the HSE Service Plan includes a particular focus on obesity with a coordinated approach being implemented in the Community Healthcare Networks in line with the Integrated Care Programme for Chronic Disease.</p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.</p><p>Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p><p>The NTPF have advised my Department that there are 643 patients on the IPDC orthopaedics waiting list with an area of residence in County Mayo.

Under Section 20 of the Act, the times at which annual leave is taken is ultimately determined by the employer subject to the leave being granted within the leave year to which it relates, or, with the consent of the employee within the period of six months of the end of that leave year. </p>  <p>  An employee&rsquo;s entitlement to annual leave was introduced as a health and safety measure under the European Working Time Directive, which the OWTA transposed. While there have been less opportunities for foreign travel and recreation activities this year, it is still important that employees avail of annual leave to take a break, avoid burnout and maintain an appropriate work-life balance. This is even more true for those workers who have been engaged in front line or emergency work related to the pandemic and have faced an extremely stressful and challenging year.</p>  <p>  My Department has not received any representations to date that would suggest that the carryover of annual leave is a particularly pressing issue for employees at this time. However, I have sought the views of the social partners on this matter via the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) sub-group on Employment and Enterprise. With regard to emergency workers I have received assurances from both the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE that public sector and frontline workers have been encouraged to take annual leave throughout the pandemic. </p>  <p>  If an employee believes they have been denied their right to take annual leave they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.</p></reply>

An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status can be found at www.esb.ie/ecars  . </p><p>In addition, we have committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network across Ireland and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: </p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The high powered and fast chargers will be mainly concentrated on or near national roads and motorways to enable longer journeys to be completed. Four multi charger sites have already been delivered, including one on the M9 in Kildare with an additional site planned for Monasterevin. </p><p>More information on these upgrades can be found at .</p><p>My Department also supports the Public Charge Point Scheme which is administered through the SEAI and which will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and to support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p></reply>

There has been a history of widespread non-compliance with this dual consent process with many operators in the sector lacking planning permission and / or an IPC licence.     </p>  <p>  Following a 2019 High Court judgment which re-affirmed, inter alia, that commercial peat extraction absent planning permission constitutes unauthorised development, the onus is on operators to first regularise their past activities via the planning system and then secure planning permission  before any recommencement of harvesting could take place.   </p>  <p>  The suspension of commercial peat extraction has commercial implications for both operators in the sector and also for the horticultural sector. I am also aware that a recent unrelated Supreme Court judgment on the Substitute Consent mechanism within the planning system has further complicated the process facing operators. It is not open to the State to simply remove the requirement for operators to regularise their past unauthorised development.    </p>  <p>  Insofar as the availability of supplies for horticulture use in 2021 is concerned, officials from my Department will engage with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the matter and on the potential longer term solutions for the sector.    </p>  <p>Rather than focusing on a recommencement of further commercial peat extraction, my immediate priority is on bog rehabilitation and restoration. This has significant potential to be part of our broader strategy to tackle climate and biodiversity challenges. Last month, the Government approved my proposals to provide funding of up-to &euro;108m for the Bord Na Mona Enhanced Decommissioning, Rehabilitation and Restoration Scheme (EDRRS) to support a just transition in the midlands region, while protecting the storage of 100m tonnes of carbon, sequestering 3.2m tonnes of carbon out to 2050, enhancing biodiversity, creating jobs and contributing to Ireland's objective of being climate-neutral by 2050.</p></reply>

Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) manages salmon on an individual river basis as each river has it own genetically unique stock of salmon. These individual stocks are subject to annual scientific and management review. Exploitation is only permitted on stocks which are meeting their individual conservation limit - the number of spawning adults to maintain a healthy population.  Such rivers are open to angling and, where a commercial fishery exists to commercial harvest.  Estuaries are open to fishing only where the rivers contributing to the estuary are each maintaining a sustainable surplus. A statutory public consultation process on the draft legislation governing salmon fishing for 2021 closes tomorrow. </p>  <p>  IFI also undertakes ongoing research and monitoring of eel populations in Irish waters every year. The European eel is a single stock across the entire European continent and distribution is naturally random between countries.  The species is on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (ICUN) red list of endangered species. The very latest international scientific advice is that anthropogenic mortality should be kept at zero or as close to zero as possible. In line with this advice, and Ireland's Eel Management Plan approved by the European Commission under EU regulation 1100/2007, the fishery in Ireland remains closed and there is a prohibition in legislation on issuing licences. No harvesting of eels is permitted and I have no plans to change this position.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic.The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.It will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 3 December 2020, over 139,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Surveys have been completed in the following areas across Co Kildare, Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown and Donaghcumper. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre to the home network to these premises, followed by pre build and build works. I am advised that NBI intend to have completed surveys at this location in early 2021 and the indicative target commencement of network build at this location will be available following that work.The first fibre to the home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline and  will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from early 2021 retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December, 217 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. 59 publicly accessible BCPs across the country are now live. BCPs locations due for installation in Kildare include Backgate Lodge, Kilkee Demesne, Castledermot and Crookstown Further Education and Training Centre.  Bigstone Community Hall is now fully connected with public WiFi and Lullymore Heritage Park is installed and waiting connectivity.  Further details can be found at .  </p><p>Rathmore National School and St Davids National School in Co Kildare will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative by the end of the year. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has just been announced which will see almost 700 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The IMDO recently reviewed the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 GB Landbridge Study and in particular the issue of direct maritime connectivity and capacity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO analysis shows that there is sufficient capacity on existing direct services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for all of the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.  The shipping industry serving Ireland have shown that they are resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.</p>  <p>  My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019.  We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they will respond.  Additional shipping links were added on direct routes to Continental Europe even during the Covid-19 pandemic in Summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity announced to take place starting from January 2021, including new RoRo (roll on roll off) services from Ireland to Zeebrugge, Santander and Portugal by CLdN. New LoLo (lift on lift-off) and Bulk services have also been added in the period. Increased frequency by Irish Ferries and Stena Line on the Ireland/Cherbourg routes from 1 January 2020 will mean that between them there will be a daily service available from Ireland to France. Brittany Ferries have also increased their number of sailings from next year. </p>  <p>Indeed, a new six-day per week RoRo service from Rosslare to Dunkirk was announced on 27 November to commence in   January 2020.  There will be three new vessels on the route with a journey time of 24 hours from Rosslare to Dunkerque, carrying around 120 trucks / trailers.  </p>  <p>  Such announcements reinforce the IMDO report findings about the willingness and ability of the shipping sector to adjust and respond to market demand. </p>  <p>  The Government considers that direct State intervention to establish State shipping links in the context of Brexit would be likely to undermine a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place. Such an intervention would be almost certain to result in legal challenges from shipping providers already providing services to Continental Europe, would result in breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid.  It could also create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving, in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods from Ireland to the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge.  Shipping companies should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening </p>  <p>  A communications campaign is currently underway, "ACT now and Prepare to switch", which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now. This campaign encourages stakeholders to Assess their current routes to market, Communicate their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and Trial alternative services so that disruption to the GB Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders, including importers, exporters and freight and logistics stakeholders, as we all prepare for the post Brexit scenario arising from January 2021.</p></reply>

To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking established in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager who resides in the EU to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport, depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination.  </p><p>As highlighted by the European Commission in their notice to stakeholders in 2018 and more recently in July of this year, after the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December any Transport Manager CPC issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom will no longer be valid to work for an EU operator.  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC who are currently nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators.  The Department wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators in October 2019 to highlight the position as outlined by the European Commission and communicated with them again last month in this regard. </p><p>The matter of UK-issued Transport Manager CPCs held by Transport Managers working for Irish operators is among the issues that have been raised by my Department in ongoing engagement with the European Commission in the context of Brexit. The matter similarly impacts, for example, on people living in the EU and working for other EU-based operators but holding a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC. The Commission recently provided clarification that a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC may be issued to UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators, before the end of the Brexit transition period. This means that these Transport Managers will not now be required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator.  </p><p>In view of this clarification, my Department has established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Management CPC.  CILT is the body with responsibility for issuing Transport Management CPCs in Ireland on behalf of my Department.  A further communication has now been issued by my Department to affected Transport Managers to outline how to contact CILT in order to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC.</p><p>It is important to note that application must be made to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it will <i>not</i>be possible to obtain an Irish Transport Management CPC on the basis of holding a UK certificate. My Department has emphasised this point to affected Transport Managers and has urged them to contact CILT as soon as possible.</p><p>No fee will apply in this case for obtaining an Irish Transport Management CPC.</p></reply>

The service resumed, on a gradual basis, in mid-July.     </p>  <p>  Since resuming operations, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog.  Unfortunately, due to social distancing and other public health and hygiene requirements, service capacity has had to be considerably reduced. This means that customers experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended.     </p>  <p>  In addition, Level 5 restrictions which took effect for six weeks from 22 October 2020 to the 01 December, meant that driving tests were only available to those involved in essential services, including essential retail work. While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety must remain of paramount importance.    </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is currently examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints and is working in close consultation with my Department on this matter. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.   </p>  <p>  My Department has recently approved the retention by the RSA of 18 temporary driver testers whose contracts were due to expire in October and November, and the RSA has also rehired a further 18 temporary testers whose contracts expired in May. This will help to increase testing capacity. However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.   </p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased within current health constraints. Due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. As a result, the number of tests a tester can safely conduct per day was reduced from eight to five when the service reopened.  Following experience of managing the tests under Covid restrictions, this was increased to six in mid-September. This may be raised to 7, depending on health assurance, but not until January 2021 at the earliest.   </p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.  It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.</p></reply>

Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive, also maintains several standstill provisions and derogations that allows it to maintain reduced rates, zero rates and exemptions to certain supplies for historical reasons. These standstill provisions and derogations cannot be extended. </p>  <p>  In accordance with one such standstill provision, white (including off-white and cream) cylindrical candles and night-lights are zero rated for VAT purposes. Other candles and night-lights, such as those that are decorated, spiralled, tapered or perfumed, are liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>  <p>  I introduced an amendment in Finance Bill 2020 to remove the application of the zero rate of VAT to a category of candles which will consequently provide for the taxation of all candles at the standard rate of VAT, currently 21%. Following discussions at Committee Stage of the Bill and having received numerous representations,  I decided on a later date for implementing this change on the basis that this will allow the parties involved to amend their pricing and contracts which would already have been set based on the zero rate of VAT.  The proposed amendment will come into effect on 1 January 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-10a.635.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000071#WRK04400"><p>I would like to advise the Deputy that the suggestion that section 127B of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA), 1997 is not in compliance with international law or international tax principles is inaccurate and appears to be based on a misunderstanding of a number of matters including Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign right to tax activity in domestic legislation, how relief may be given under Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) to alleviate double taxation that may arise as a result of domestic legislation being applied in more than one country on the same income, as well as a misunderstanding of the the status of model treaties, including the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital (MTC). </p>  <p>  As I advised last week, section 127B TCA, 1997 provides that income arising to an individual from an employment exercised aboard an aircraft that is operated in international traffic shall be chargeable to tax in Ireland where the aircraft is operated by an enterprise that has its place of effective management in the State.  </p>  <p>  The domestic provision contained in section 127B needs to be understood in the context of the international tax regime and in particular the network of DTAs that have been concluded between States, including by Ireland, over the past years and decades.  DTAs are bilateral agreements entered into by two sovereign States which govern how their tax systems interact.  DTAs are designed to provide specific relief with a view to alleviating double taxation that may arise as a result of domestic legislation being applied in more than one country on the same income.  DTAs provide relief from double taxation in particular by granting exclusive taxing rights, thus ensuring either that the income or gain should be taxed in one jurisdiction only; or by agreeing primary and secondary taxing rights, providing that the country with secondary taxing rights should offer relief against the tax payable in that country for the tax suffered in the other country with primary taxing rights.  </p>  <p>  If there is a charge to income tax in Ireland arising from the operation of Section 127B and a charge to tax on the same income in another jurisdiction then the exact arrangement in relation to the taxation of flight crew depends on the wording of the relevant DTA.  For example, Article 14(3) of the Ireland-Netherlands DTA grants sole taxing rights to the country in which the employee is resident in respect of remuneration from an employment exercised aboard an aircraft in international traffic.  </p>  <p>  It is therefore important to note that the operation of the relevant DTA does not undermine or invalidate the domestic charge to tax, and that, whilst DTAs provide relief from double taxation, they cannot themselves form the basis for a charge to tax, nor do they purport to do so.  </p>  <p>  The OECD MTC is one of a number of model treaties which States may choose to adopt (whether in whole or in part) in concluding and/or amending their DTAs.  The model treaties are non-binding instruments which aim to provide guidance to countries in designing and negotiating double tax treaties, as well as in applying and interpreting them.  The OECD MTC, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon, constitute guidance for OECD contracting states when concluding or revising bilateral DTAs and there is no legal obligation, as a matter of international, EU or domestic law, to incorporate the OECD MTC into existing DTAs or those yet to be negotiated, or domestic tax legislation.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s DTAs reflect, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the tax policies of each of the two contracting states, the OECD MTC in the version published when those DTAs were concluded.   In the case of the DTAs concluded by Ireland with other EU Member States, such DTAs were concluded before November 2017, i.e at a date when the following version of Article 15(3) of the OECD MTC applied:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic &hellip; may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Model treaties may be amended from time to time, and when the OECD MTC is amended this has no impact on Ireland&rsquo;s existing DTAs unless and until the relevant DTA is amended or replaced through subsequent bilateral negotiations, or its operation is modified through the ratification of a multilateral instrument, such as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.   </p>  <p>  In any event, no conflict arises between existing DTAs and the 2017 update to the OECD MTC, as the Commentaries therein confirm that, in considering which aspects of that MTC to draw on when negotiating and concluding a DTA, Contracting States may validly prefer to tax the remuneration of international aircrew in the State of the enterprise operating the aircraft, notwithstanding the amendment to Article 15.3 by the 2017 OECD MTC.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a fully committed OECD member and the approach adopted by Ireland in concluding or revising DTAs has been, and continues to be, fully consistent with that commitment.</p></reply>

It is designed to allow individuals, families, businesses and services better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures Government might introduce to stop escalation of the transmission of the disease. </p>  <p>  In line with the plan for Living with Covid-19 the Government has in recent months framed restrictions to account for periods where there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission through to situations where there is high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. Throughout this period the Government has made an exemption for weddings in view of the importance of these occasions to couples and the level of planning that is involved for couples and their families. </p>  <p>  On 27 November the Government agreed the approach for easing restrictions including a phased move to Level 3 nationally, with a number of exceptions in place for the Christmas period.  Currently weddings can take place but with a limit of 25 guests for ceremony and reception. Additionally couples resident in a particular county, but with existing plans to get married can travel to get married outside that county. Unfortunately neither live music nor dancing is permitted at weddings.</p>  <p>  Each level of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The risk level at this time has meant that some activities have not been permitted such as live music or dancing at weddings. I understand the difficulties these restrictions pose for couples on their special day and the impact on musicians and bands. However, the restrictions are informed by public health understanding of the disease and recognise we can and must prioritise some activities over others at this time.</p></reply>

It also has responsibility for the development of strategies for increasing participation in sport, including participation by women and girls.  In 2019, Sport Ireland launched its Policy on Women in Sport. The policy expresses Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to women in sport. It builds on the significant work that has already been undertaken in this area within the sport sector to date and, in recognising the opportunity to make a significant impact on the lives of women through their involvement in sport, it provides a blueprint for Sport Ireland&rsquo;s future work. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland does not provide funding direct to clubs but channels its funding through the National Governing Bodies of sport (NGBs).  In addition to funding allocated to NGBs under core grants and high performance programme, Sport Ireland also allocates funding to NGBs under the Women in Sport (WIS) programme. The WIS programme was established in 2005 and has provided funding support of over &euro;20 million to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation by women and girls. </p>  <p>  As part of the new Women in Sport Policy, a revised Women in Sport investment programme was launched last year with an investment of &euro;3 million over the two years 2019 and 2020. This doubled the funding for the Women in Sport programme.   The two year funding will enable NGBs to make significant progress in their strategic objectives for women in sport. </p>  <p>  I am arranging for Sport Ireland to provide the Deputy with a comprehensive outline of its strategies and initiatives in place to increase participation by women and girls.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. </p>  <p>  In relation to capital supports, the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas. On 30th November, Minister Catherine Martin and I announced that a new 2020 round of the Programme was opening with applications accepted up until 12th February, 2021. At least &euro;40 million is being made available. One of the key criteria in scoring applications has always been whether the proposed project will increase participation including the likelihood of increasing female participation. I expect that projects likely to increase female participation will again be prioritised when the scoring system for this new round is finalised.</p>  <p>  With regard to structural funding inequalities, I believe that these can best be addressed by the development of a common funding approach and framework to guide an equitable distribution of State funding in the future. I have already discussed this matter with Sport Ireland and I am committed to ensuring that it is progressed in the short term. Sport Ireland has also recently commissioned an independent report into its player support funding programmes and I look forward to receiving the outcome of that report from Sport Ireland in the early part of next year.</p></reply>

The local authority has responsibility for ensuring the AHB are providing social housing to the appropriate standards set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  The AHB has responsibility for ensuring that all such tenancies are registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, and that the protections provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004-2020 are provided as appropriate.  Tenants have recourse to the Dispute Resolution processes provided for in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004-2020.</p>  <p>  When it is proposed that a social housing applicant will be allocated a unit with an AHB, a tenancy interview takes place where the applicant is advised of all relevant information in relation to the proposed tenancy and pre-tenancy training takes place before the tenancy commences.  Tenants are typically made aware of all facilities available to them, as well as their rights and obligations, and matters such as the keeping of pets are covered.  Where Part V units are acquired in a development that contains ancillary facilities on the campus, access to such facilities is not generally covered by a social housing tenancy.  Access to services and facilities outside the social housing tenancy are not a matter for my Department.</p></reply>

This will be utilised across two new programmes to deliver affordable homes to purchase and rent, the existing Serviced Sites Fund, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and through the Land Development Agency.</p><p>From this sum, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for two new national schemes to designed to deliver more affordable housing the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and the Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b></b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes. Both of these programmes will begin in 2021. </p><p>&euro;75 million of this sum will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers including single persons, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.</p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.</p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  It will allow cost-covering rents to be set a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>In addition to these new schemes, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018. </p><p>The broad parameters of the local authority led Affordable Purchase Scheme will be as follows: </p><p>- aimed at first-time buyers, including single persons, who cannot purchase a home adequate to their needs on the open market under the macro prudential rules;</p><p>- homes purchased under the scheme will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), with the final price of the affordable homes to be linked to the cost of provision, on a site by site basis, and</p><p>- the local authority maintains a fully repayable equity share in the properties equivalent to the percentage discount given. </p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under all of the above schemes will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) will play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of more affordable housing, as promised in the Programme for Government. The LDA is currently developing 9 sites that have near-term delivery potential for 3,600 new homes, the majority of which will be for Cost Rental and affordable purchase. It is also engaged in the progression of a number of other sites with potential for significant housing output.  In the longer term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which will bring essential long-term stability and sustainability to the Irish housing system. </p><p>In addition to the above, an enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available on the Revenue website. </p><p>Finally, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website.</p></reply>

Local Authorities are responsible for the enforcement of this legislation. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a local authority can prohibit the use of an overcrowded dwelling, irrespective of whether it is being let or not, and can serve notice on the owner of a dwelling specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy it without causing overcrowding.  If the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, the authority can require the owner to desist from this within a period not exceeding 21 days. Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 and/or to imprisonment for up to one month.</p>  <p>  Overcrowding may give rise to concerns in respect of fire safety, and may lead to enforcement action by fire authorities.</p>  <p>  I am committed to empowering local authorities to deal with overcrowding more effectively. My Department is currently working on proposed legislative changes to the Housing Act 1966 which are designed to strengthen the statutory framework for the enforcement of the Act's overcrowding provisions by:</p>  <p>  - Empowering local authorities to enter a house without prior notice for the purposes of establishing whether it is overcrowded </p>  <p>  - Increasing penalties for refusing to give information or giving false information </p>  <p>  - Increasing penalties for causing or permitting overcrowding</p>  <p>  - Empowering local authorities to seek an order of the High Court stating the maximum number of occupants permitted or requiring a house to be vacated</p></reply>

A number of work strands are underway to deliver Cost Rental housing, with State support, through a number of delivery pathways, utilising the expertise of Local Authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA), and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p>  <p>  A Cost Rental Working Group was established by then Minister in 2019, bringing together representatives from the Departments of Housing, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform, the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, the LDA, the Residential Tenancies Board, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council. The Group&rsquo;s deliberations have informed the Government&rsquo;s current plans for Cost Rental, particularly relating to the initial on-balance sheet delivery of State-supported schemes, aimed at moderate-income households, which leverage public land or other Exchequer inputs in order to achieve lower rents. In recent months my officials have undertaken further work in this regard, which led in Budget 2021 to the development of a new funding stream for Cost Rental and forthcoming legislation to regulate this new sector, as outlined below. </p>  <p>  A research consultancy on Cost Rental sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department is also ongoing at present. The EIB has extensive experience in supporting the delivery of affordable housing across Europe, and the final consultancy report is scheduled for completion in January 2021. </p>  <p>  A number of Cost Rental developments are already underway. An AHB-led project at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown will deliver 50 Cost Rental homes in Quarter 3 of 2021. This has been supported by the Local Authority through low-cost land and Exchequer funding from my Department of &euro;4 million through the Serviced Sites Fund. </p>  <p>  Further large-scale Cost Rental projects are planned, including a Dublin City Council-led development at Emmet Road, Inchicore, Dublin City, which is projected to deliver 375 Cost Rental homes and is currently at the design stage. A public consultation process is active, and I understand that the Council intends to lodge a planning application in early 2021. The LDA&rsquo;s first project, a joint venture with D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council at Shanganagh, Shankill, includes 306 Cost Rental homes. The project received planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2020 and construction is expected to begin in early 2021. </p>  <p>  In advance of the delivery of these developments, and in order to accelerate delivery of Cost Rental in the near term, as part of Budget 2021 I announced a specific funding stream for Cost Rental projects being undertaken by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). This Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme will see &euro;35 million of long-term loans on favourable terms made available to AHBs to support the delivery of approximately 350 Cost Rental homes next year. CREL will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social homes. It is anticipated that a call for CREL applications from AHBs will issue very shortly in order to facilitate the allocation of funding as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  When combined with the 50 Cost Rental homes to be delivered at Enniskerry Road, the additional homes under the CREL scheme should see up to 400 Cost Rental homes delivered in 2021, through a combination of SSF and CREL funding, in addition to the corresponding debt finance provided by the Housing Finance Agency. As per the underlying policy, rents for all Cost Rental units will be as a result of the cost of delivery, less State capital subvention through mechanisms such as SSF and CREL. For example, the rents at Enniskerry Road will be &euro;1,200 per month for a two bedroom apartment, in an area where rents for comparable homes on the private market are approximately &euro;2,000 per month. While rents for units funded through the new CREL scheme will only become clear through the application process for funding by AHBs, I expect that rents for these units will be comparable to those at Enniskerry Road. </p>  <p>  Finally, I also intend to place Ireland&rsquo;s new Cost Rental sector on a statutory footing in the new Affordable Housing Bill, which I plan to bring to Government in the coming weeks. While precise eligibility conditions and operational matters for Cost Rental are being finalised by my officials as part of this process, this legislation will be an important element in defining and regulating this new sector. </p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements.</p><p>The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. However, in the vast majority of cases a payment plan to deal with the arrears is agreed between the tenant and the local authority, before there is any necessity to advise the landlord.  </p><p>The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent. Since HAP was rolled out in 2014 to end 2019, HAP support has been ceased for 1,213 tenancies due to tenant differential rent arrears. This represented 1.7% of all tenancies set up during that period. </p><p>In line with broader policy approaches on foot of Covid-19, a decision was taken in March 2020 to suspend the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP).  Non-payment of differential rent during the Covid emergency period did not, therefore, affect payments to HAP landlords, although tenants that were not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures were expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.</p><p>However, the payment of HAP in respect of those tenancies that had already entered the cessation stage of the DMP prior to the suspension of the process in March remained suspended, and local authorities were advised to proceed in ceasing those tenancies. In 2020, 18<b></b>tenancies have had their HAP support ceased for non-payment of differential rent, after the debt management process was fully completed.</p><p>In October 2020, I approved the recommencement of the DMP, with extended timeframes incorporated into the process to assist HAP tenants in clearing their arrears over a longer period of time. Since recommencement, over 2,000 households have been removed from the DMP and this has safeguarded the HAP support and landlord payments in those cases.</p><p>In relation to the average time in, and amount of, arrears outstanding at the time of cessation, the SSC advise that this information is not readily available from their &quot;live&quot; operating system. Information is only recorded on the current balance which will more than likely have changed since the tenancy was ceased if a write off of the amount outstanding had been approved or if the tenant began to pay off the arrears. </p><p>HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

Not achieving such densities would result in towns becoming more spread out and car dependent, with negative implications for tackling climate change and for promoting and sustaining public transport systems or even for the provision of cycling and walking networks.</p>  <p>  In addition, achieving densities of at least 35 dph within key towns is essential in providing housing choice for the more diverse range of smaller households in emerging today, including couples who may wish to downsize, creating the flexibility for households to stay in their neighbourhoods/towns as their housing requirements change. Such densities are achievable through a mix of some individual homes, coupled with a significant level of semi-detached and some terraced housing.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to have ongoing engagement with the local authority sector, including individual local authorities, on a wide range of policy issues, including those relating to residential density.  There are further considerations with regard to the density of residential development proposals within urban settlements, including key towns, particularly relating to overall context and location within the settlement, that would benefit from further articulation in updated planning guidance.  Accordingly, it is my intention to bring forward sustainable settlement guidance in early 2021.</p></reply>

This brought about a fundamental change in the operation of the RTB by expanding its regulatory remit.</p>  <p>  The breaches of rental law that the Investigations &amp;amp; Sanctions (I&amp;S) unit can investigate include; failure to comply with RPZ requirements; failure to register a tenancy; a reason given on a notice of termination that is known to be false or misleading; and failure to offer a tenant their tenancy back when certain conditions have been met. The RTB also has the power to apply sanctions if breaches are found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  The RTB has set up a dedicated I&amp;S Unit which includes 15 staff members with a collective experience in conducting civil and criminal investigations in other regulatory and enforcement bodies as well as significant internal knowledge of the RTB and the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  An increase of &euro;2M in Current Exchequer Funding was made available to the RTB in 2020, bringing the total amount of funding for operational costs for the RTB to &euro;9M and an additional &euro;2M in Current Exchequer funding for RTB operational costs has been secured in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The RTB received sanction for an additional 29 staff in 2019 in order that it would be resourced to deliver on its broadened mandate and sanction for a further additional 5 staff was granted in July 2020 following the Residential Tenancies and Valuations Act 2020. </p>  <p>  The increase in funding and staff provided to the RTB is designed to ensure that the new legislative provisions introduced in both 2019 and 2020 are fully and forcefully implemented. </p>  <p>  RTB investigators (Authorised Officers) have wide-ranging and significant investigative powers provided for in the Act including the power to inspect premises, compel persons to assist with the investigation by producing certain documents or attending an interview or oral hearing.</p>  <p>  The RTB investigations and sanctions regime allows proportionality to be applied to the sanctioning of potential breaches. Landlords are also given the opportunity to acknowledge the breach at an early stage. An acknowledgement of improper conduct and the extent and timeliness of any steps taken by the landlord to end the improper conduct and to remedy its consequences may also be taken into consideration by independent Decision Makers. All sanctions recommended by the Decision Makers must be confirmed by the Circuit Court. Once confirmed by the Court the decision is issued to the landlord and the complainant, if applicable and is published by the RTB.</p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019 the RTB has analysed over 1,000 contacts from members of the public to its dedicated Investigations channel as well as data from the RTB&rsquo;s own systems, open source data from rental websites and advertising platforms, and data shared with the RTB from local authorities and the Department of Employment and Social Protection to identify potential breaches of rental law that can be investigated.</p>  <p>  To the end of quarter 3 2020 over 250 investigations were approved. The most common allegation investigated to date is breach of Rent Pressure Zone requirements.</p>  <p>  To date over &euro;75,000 has been refunded to current and former tenants as a direct result of the investigation process. Over 50 decisions have been made by the independent decision makers. Once decisions have been confirmed by the Circuit Court and the Court Order issued to the landlord the Order will be published on the RTB&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the Investigations and Sanctions unit will continue to develop its risk based approach to proactive investigation of suspected improper conduct by landlords.This would mean that the RTB is using its resources to best effect to target investigations where the risk to past, present or future tenants is the highest thus building public trust and confidence in the RTB as a credible regulator.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the RTB will continue to develop and implement a stakeholder engagement plan which will communicate the role and impact of the new Investigations and Sanctions function to encourage compliance with rental law including the publication of Court confirmed sanctions. In addition, it will focus on sharing key metrics which demonstrate the overall societal impact of the RTB&rsquo;s expanded regulatory remit and will demonstrate how landlords can comply as well as the implications of non-compliance.</p>  <p>  The RTB will also continue to commence new investigations with priority on investigating allegations of improper conduct raised by members of the public and other government agencies through concerns and formal written complaints.</p>  <p>  More information on the RTB&rsquo;s Investigation and Sanction function is available on the RTB website</p></reply>

The regulations came in to operation on 31 January 2020 and it has been open for applications since the end of June 2020. It is not a compensation scheme and is very much a scheme of last resort for homeowners who have no other practical options of redress.</p>  <p>  The Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme was informed by the report of an Expert Panel which was published in 2017 which involved extensive research, investigations and analysis.  Any consideration of extension to the Defective Concrete Blocks Grants Scheme would, in the first instance, require the relevant local authority to conduct the same rigorous analysis as that carried out in Donegal and Mayo.  </p>  <p>  Such analysis would need to demonstrate that identified issues in Limerick were due to the presence of excessive amounts of deleterious materials (mica or pyrite) in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The relevant "I.S.465" protocol would need to be followed in this regard. The extent of the problem would also need to be quantified. </p>  <p>  Separately, my Department has recently extended the pyrite remediation scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme. </p></reply>

AHBs secure 70%+ of the funding through private finance arrangements with the Housing Finance Agency or other sources.  </p>  <p>  Part of the decision process by my Department is the assessment of the level of CALF funding that a proposed project requires, which is assessed on the basis of the value for money of the investment over the lifetime of the project. AHBs are required to submit a full financial analysis of the project including sources of funding available and any assumptions made in respect of income and expenditure over the term of the proposed Payment and Availability Agreements (P&amp;A Agreement). This assessment involves analysing the income, expenditure and inflation assumptions against a standard set of assumptions agreed with my Department. The appropriate level of CALF is determined by reference to Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). This provides a threshold against which funding applications can be measured and the funding adjusted to achieve this threshold value.   </p>  <p>  In the case of this particular project, a number of the homes under this project are proposed to be funded under my Department under P&amp;A-CALF. My Department issued an approval in principal in January 2019, which has since lapsed. A further application is expected in respect of this project.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the formal establishment of the Approved Housing Bodies Regulatory Authority, the oversight of AHBs is conducted through the Voluntary Regulation Code (the Code), "Building for the Future, A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland" underpinned by three standards - Financial, Governance and Performance Standards.  </p>  <p>  The Code is overseen by an Interim Regulatory Committee supported by a Regulation Office based in the Housing Agency. In accordance with Department Circular 15/2016, only those AHBs that have signed up to the Code and have undergone a satisfactory assessment as part of the assessment process by the Regulation Office are considered eligible for funding. Co-operative Housing Ireland are signed up to the Code. </p>  <p>  The matter of Value for Money (VFM) is covered in the Performance Standard.  An AHB must continuously manage, monitor, challenge and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services, and ensure that the costs of supplying these services are competitive and offer VFM. These considerations should be applied across all services, including the materials and services that the AHB procures, as well as those it provides directly.</p>  <p>  AHBs are expected to have policy and procedures that include:</p>  <p>  - How VFM is achieved across the business, with a particular emphasis upon the areas of highest spend;</p>  <p>  - The evaluation of both the cost and quality of services through the use of agreed measures;</p>  <p>  - An approach to procurement that delivers the greatest long-term benefits to the organisation and meets public procurement rules; and</p>  <p>  - Regular monitoring and reporting of performance in achieving VFM objectives.</p></reply>

Subject to the final qualifying criteria, a limited equity stake would be taken in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying their new home with their available mortgage.</p>  <p>  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement is progressing with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018. The broad parameters of the local authority led Affordable Purchase Scheme will be as follows:</p>  <p>  - aimed at first-time buyers;</p>  <p>  - homes purchased under the scheme will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), with the final price of the affordable homes to be linked to the cost of provision, on a site by site basis, and,</p>  <p>  - the local authority maintains a fully repayable equity share in the properties equivalent to the percentage discount given.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the homes delivered under both of the above schemes will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which I intend to bring to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them. I understand that Dublin City Council has included these buildings on its Record of Protected Structures (RPS).</p>  <p>  The National Monuments Service in my Department has been engaged for some time with the HSE, as owner of the site, in relation to the proposals to undertake certain conservation works at the nearby burial ground. On foot of those discussions, also involving Dublin City Council, the HSE commissioned a condition assessment and conservation report of the graveyard last year. This accords with best practice as a first step in managing such a heritage site. </p>  <p>  The making of a landscape assessment and conservation plan for the buildings is also a matter for the HSE itself. However, the Heritage Council published &lsquo;Historic Landscape Characterisation in Ireland: Best Practice Guidance&rsquo;, in 2013, which may be of assistance. The Heritage Council may also be able to assist through its Community Grants Scheme, which it will be running in 2021. Details will be announced by the Heritage Council in due course.</p></reply>

The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is set out in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that; the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; and that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship. </p>  <p>  Local discretion and flexibility are inherent in the devolved function of administering rent schemes.  Decisions regarding the increase or decrease in the rent charged to tenants of local authorities are matters for individual local authorities in accordance with it's differential rent scheme.</p></reply>

The work of our homeless services has been exemplary in this regard.</p></reply>

Settlements are illegal under international law. Ireland&rsquo;s position on the illegality of Israeli settlements informs our engagement with the State of Israel across a range of bilateral issues and will continue to do so.</p>  <p>  UN Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted on 23 December 2016, states that Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory have no legal validity and are a major obstacle for peace. The Resolution calls for an immediate end to settlement activities and also calls on all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967. In all these aspects, the Resolution reflected the position already held by Ireland and the UN for many years, and the EU position, to which Ireland has made a significant contribution. </p>  <p>  The legal basis for relations between the EU and the State of Israel is the EU-Israel Association Agreement that entered force in 2000. On 10 December 2012, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process, supported by Ireland, which state that &lsquo;all agreements between the State of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967. In 2013, guidelines were produced which differentiate between Israeli activities in the occupied territory, including illegal settlements, and in the State of Israel for the purpose of EU funding from 2014 onwards.</p>  <p>  The participation of Israel in the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme is governed by a 2014 agreement between the EU and Israel that makes Israel subject to the relevant EU legislation establishing Horizon 2020 and its implementing rules. Article 6 of the agreement states that the agreement does not apply to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.</p></reply>

There are credible allegations of mass casualties and of human rights abuses, although the ongoing communications blackout has made it very difficult to verify information.  </p>  <p>  Although Prime Minister Abuy has declared the end of the offensive in Tigray, there are reports that the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has gone into hiding.  The risk of insurgency, combined with ethnic profiling, high levels of displacement and humanitarian need, all suggest this crisis is far from over. Reports of the forcible return of Eritrean refugees in Tigray to Eritrea are extremely worrying. </p>  <p>  Ireland actively supports the EU, UN and wider efforts to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union. I welcome the recent visit of EU Commissioner Lenarcic to Ethiopia and Sudan.  While the UN achieved agreement on humanitarian access to Tigray, it only allows access to areas controlled by Government.  Humanitarian access to all affected areas is essential.</p>  <p>  Minister Coveney has called on all parties to cease hostilities, respect international humanitarian law, and begin dialogue. In contacts, including with key African leaders, he has also stressed the need for unconditional, unrestricted access for humanitarian actors to affected areas and discussed ways to support regional efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis.</p>  <p>  My Department is preparing a &euro;2.4 million package of funding to support the humanitarian response in Tigray including &euro;1.4 million to Irish and other NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to UNHCR to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan and &euro;500,000 worth of humanitarian stocks. </p>  <p>  The UN Security Council held informal talks on the crisis on 23 November. In the context of our upcoming tenure on the UN Security Council, Ireland will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and advocate for a peaceful resolution to the current conflict, including through the Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and the Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in an area also have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In some instances where a new primary school is required, the new schools are designated as Irish-medium gaelscoileanna in advance of the patronage process, in accordance with a framework in place since September 2019. </p>  <p>  For other primary schools, parental preferences for applicant patrons, along with their preference for the language of instruction (Irish or English) of the new school, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, form part of the patronage process, and are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  It is through this process that a new primary school can be an Irish-medium Gaelscoil or an English-medium school. </p>  <p>  Separately, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process is being developed and is intended to also provide an opportunity to increase the number of Gaelscoileanna nationwide.  This process is aimed at accelerating the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools towards the Government target of 400 such schools by 2030.  The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-/non-denominational schools in Irish or English and an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.  Separately to the main Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process, school communities can directly engage with their school patron regarding transfer of patronage to become a multi-denominational school, including a multi-denominational Irish-medium school.   Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage should contact their school patron directly.</p>  <p>  There is no separate mechanism by which new independent primary schools established by private parties are recognised and/or supported by the Department.</p></reply>

This is usually undertaken the same day they are notified, but it may be the following day. </p>  <p>  Public Health will work with the school principal to identify the close contacts and all close contact will be informed and scheduled for testing and asked to restrict their movements. Parent/guardians will be informed if their child is a close contact.  </p>  <p>  The wider school community can be informed that the school is working with public health who are guiding the school through the actions they need to take to protect staff, students and the school community.  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, Public Health HSE. All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.</p>  <p>  Schools are working hard to implement the public health advice which is proving to be effective in keeping transmission levels in schools so low. All recommendations are being kept under review by consultants / specialists in Public Health as we continue to deal with the ongoing pandemic.</p></reply>

The maximum personal rate for jobseekers is &euro;203 which also provides increased allowances for adult and child dependents.</p>  <p>  A self-employed individual who transitions from PUP may be eligible for support under the Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Support Grant that provides support of up to &euro;1,000 with business re-start costs.  To date, this support has assisted over 7,400 businesses transitioning from the pandemic unemployment payment at a cost of approximately &euro;6.9 million.  </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;12 million had been made available for this grant in 2020.  As part of the Budget 2021 measures, an additional &euro;12 million has been allocated to the grant so that it will be available to business owners who may not be in a position to re-start their business and transition from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment until 2021.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for housing related issues rests with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution.</p>  <p>  Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) 2013, measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The CCMA issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and ensures that the responsibility of forbearance remains with the mortgage service provider.</p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. </p>  <p>  A cross-industry co-ordination Group, chaired by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), is looking at all coronavirus related issues that may impact customers.  This includes both the overall economic impact of the coronavirus situation and its direct effect on customers.  A number of emergency measures have also been announced by individual lending bodies including increased overdraft facilities and increased credit card and cash withdrawal limits.</p>  <p>  For those mortgage holders coming to an end of a COVID-19 payment break, lenders will need to assess the position with the borrower to see if they are in a position to resume loan repayments.  For those borrowers who will still be impacted by COVID-19 or who will otherwise need further support and assistance, lenders will need to consider the situation on a &lsquo;case-by-case&rsquo; basis and to provide further support having regard to the circumstances of the particular case.</p>  <p>  Support is also available from Abhaile, the national mortgage arrears resolution service.  It is provided free of charge to borrowers who are at risk of losing their home due to mortgage arrears.  Abhaile is focussed on providing expert financial and legal advice and assistance to borrowers to identify and put in place solutions to their arrears, and wherever possible, enable the borrowers remain in their home.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

This extension will apply to parents who may have already availed of their existing entitlements. </p>  <p>  Heads of a Bill to effect these changes were approved by the Government this week and it is anticipated that the legislation will be introduced in the New Year.</p>  <p>  Payment of Parents&rsquo; Benefit is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection, and I understand that it will take time for the relevant IT system changes to be made.  As a result, the estimated timescale for the necessary updates being put in place is April 2021.  </p>  <p>  However, I am examining whether it may be possible for Parents&rsquo; Leave to be taken in advance of these changes and the benefit claimed retrospectively, once the legislation has been enacted. I will take advice from Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that it is possible to draft the legislation in this way. I will ensure that parents are fully informed of their entitlements in this regard as soon as possible.</p>  <p>   Myself, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have discussed this issue with the view to progressing it as soon as possible. </p>  <p>   The extension to Parents&rsquo; Leave and Benefit follows a number of advancements in family leaves in recent years, including the introduction of Parents&rsquo; Leave and Benefit in 2019 and the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks in September this year for a child under 12 years.</p>  <p>   As part of the same legislation, I will also be bringing proposals on adoptive leave. This will allow all adopting couples, whether same sex or opposite sex, to have the right to select which of them would be the qualified adopter for the purposes of  taking adoptive leave and benefit.  This is an important provision which was committed to in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>   The proposed adoptive leave proposals will also enable married male same-sex adopting couples to be eligible for adoptive leave.  It will also enable all adopting couples &ndash; same-sex and opposite-sex &ndash; to be able to choose which of the couple should take the adoptive leave.  At the moment, adoptive leave is structured so that the adopting mother takes the leave.  The new provisions would enable either the adopting mother or the adopting father to be eligible to take adoptive leave once the choice has been made by the couple.</p></reply>

I am confident that work underway through First 5, in particular the development of a new funding model will deliver on this. </p>  <p>  Annual investment in early learning and childcare has increased by 141% since 2015. This funding has been directed towards improving accessibility, quality and affordability. It has, for example, funded a second year of the free pre-school programme and enabled the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this progress, the cost of early learning and care and school age childcare remains unacceptably high for parents.  </p>  <p>  In addition to further investment, and First 5 has committed to a doubling of investment, a key project to address affordability is the development of a new funding model. An Expert Group is leading on this work, with a central objective being to consider a mechanism to control fees. </p>  <p>  Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the Expert Group's work. The Research Partner, Frontier Economics, have so far produced and published five working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues entitled: &ldquo;International Comparisons of Fees, Staff Wages and Public Investment in Early Learning and Care&rdquo;; &ldquo;International Approaches to Funding Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to Reduce Costs for Parents&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Mechanisms to Control Fees Charged to Parents for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare&rdquo;.  The research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the reform of the funding model in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the Expert Group will be made in Autumn 2021 and will set out how the additional funding pledged in First 5 can deliver optimally for children, families and the State. Further information on the progress of this work, and the working papers published to date, can be found at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</p></reply>

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds. All seven universities have confirmed that students who choose to vacate their university-owned accommodation early will receive pro-rata refunds. The exact details of these refunds vary by institution, and students are encouraged to engage with their university directly on this manner. I would hope that that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within the my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme where students are studying for the first time or are progressing to study at a higher level e.g. progressing to postgraduate study. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p>  <p>  The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions (HEI).</p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure:</p>  <p>  -  students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p>  <p>  -  students who do not avail of the grant can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p>  <p>  -  In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students.</p></reply>

The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups:</p>  <p>  1. Entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education;</p>  <p>  2. First-time mature students;</p>  <p>  3. Students with disabilities;</p>  <p>  4. Part-time/flexible learners;</p>  <p>  5. Further education and training award holders; and</p>  <p>  6. Irish Travellers.</p>  <p>  The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  A Progress Review of the National Access Plan published in December 2018 highlighted several key achievements e.g. increases in participation across a number of target groups, particularly students with disabilities and from socio-economically disadvantaged groups. </p>  <p>  The objectives of the National Access Plan are supported by a range of interventions and programmes:</p>  <p>  -  Approximately &euro;42 million within core State funding allocated to HEIs is in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from under-represented backgrounds. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups in accessing and successfully completing higher education. </p>  <p>  -  Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) which comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education and consists of three strands focussed on increasing the participation of under-represented groups in higher education. Current funding envelope of over &euro;30m from 2016-2022</p>  <p>  -  PATH 1 &ndash; Initial funding of &euro;2.7m over three years to support equity of access to teacher education programmes. Continuation of PATH 1 funding for a further three years announced at the start of 2020.</p>  <p>  -  PATH 2 (1916 Bursary) &ndash; Commenced in 2017/18 academic year and consists of 200 bursaries a year for the most socio-economically disadvantaged students from National Access Plan target groups; bursaries worth &euro;5,000 per year. Additional bursaries were announced as part of Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  -  PATH 3 -  Supports institutional capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies for increasing access to higher education by target groups. Initial funding package of &euro;7.5m over three years</p>  <p>  -  Student Assistance Fund  - annual funding of &euro;9.1m including ring-fenced funding &euro;1m for part-time students. In recent years, ring-fenced funding has also been provided for students on Professional Master of Education (PME) courses. </p>  <p>  -  Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) &ndash; &euro;9.6m in funding every year covering both higher and further education sectors. The purpose of the Fund for Students with Disabilities is to provide funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. Since 2018 it covers part-time students as well.</p>  <p>  -  HEAR and DARE schemes - The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) supports students who have a socio-economic disadvantage to enter higher education on reduced points. Latest data shows that of approximately 4,000 eligible HEAR applicants in 2019, there were just over 2,500 acceptances of a HEAR place. The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a third level alternative admissions scheme for school leavers whose disabilities have had a negative impact on their second level education. Latest data shows that of about 4,000 eligible DARE applicants in 2019, there were just over 2,600 acceptances of a DARE place.</p>  <p>  -  A study commissioned by the HEA on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education is approaching completion (focussing on trends, challenges and barriers, review of funding supports and guidance systems, recommendations). The report is due to be published in Q1 2021.</p>  <p>  As part of the response to COVID-19, a number of policy interventions have also occurred to support the goals of the National Access Plan and in particular to support disadvantaged students who are more likely to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and associated restrictions:</p>  <p>  -  &euro;15 million in support of disadvantaged students in higher and further education in accessing ICT devices </p>  <p>  -  &euro;8.1m to double the 2020/21 SAF allocation </p>  <p>  -  &euro;1.9m in the form of a once-off COVID-19 contingency fund to enable HEIs deliver local COVID-19 responses to support disadvantaged students </p>  <p>  -  &euro;300,000 for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 on Traveller participation in higher education (Dormant Accounts Funding) </p>  <p>  In relation to socio-economically disadvantaged students specifically, the HEA has recently published data analysing the socio-economic profile of our higher education population on the basis of Deprivation Index Scores. This dataset will be of significant benefit to higher education institutions in further developing their access and outreach activities and will also aide in the development of the next National Access Plan in terms of setting our ambitions for the future and measuring progress. Consultation on this new Plan will commence in 2021. </p>  <p>  There is currently no national student loan scheme in place in Ireland, as there is in other countries, and so the potential difficulties of administering such a scheme have no impact on access to higher education. Where financial support is provided to students to assist them in accessing higher education it is provided in the form of grants, bursaries or other supports not requiring repayment from the student.</p>  <p>  The main financial support available to students hoping to access further or higher education is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme where students are studying for the first time or are progressing to study at a higher level e.g. progressing to postgraduate study. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. The aim of the student maintenance grant is to make a contribution towards the cost of going to college and to assist students with their living costs while in college. </p></reply>

Figures on enrolments by subject area for the years 2014 - 2018 is available in the attached table. 2018 is the latest year for which this data is available.</p><p>This year more students than ever before were offered a place in higher education with more than 49,000 accepting an offer of a place. These places will be maintained next year, and &euro;18 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places from September 2021.  This increase will address demographic growth pressures and equates to an overall investment of nearly &euro;80 million to address the demographic increases since 2018. These places are in addition to the 1,330 additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p><p>There are a number of key strategies in place at all levels to ensure we meet existing and future skills demands. These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. .</p><p>These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package.</p><p>Under Pillar 2 of the Human Capital Initiative  3,000 undergraduate places are being created in Key Skills areas such as Science, Engineering, ICT and Professional Construction. 1,415 of these places were brought on stream for the 2020 academic year, with the remainder to follow in 2021.</p><p>Future Jobs Ireland, which was launched in March 2019 is a new whole-of Government plan to secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic success. A key element of Future Jobs Ireland is to support business, invest in the development of people and to enhance skills and develop and attract talent to ensure our education and training system is responsive to enterprise needs. We must ensure that we have accessible upskilling options and that our education and training providers offer relevant and up-to-date courses which meet the needs of enterprises and workers.</p><p>Springboard+ runs an annual call in order to be in a position to provide the most up to date skills needs courses responding to advances in technology that are impacting the future world of work.  For instance, the 2020 offering of Springboard courses included, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Governance. </p><p>In general HE institutions are constantly reviewing and updating their course curriculum in collaboration with enterprise to ensure that undergraduate and taught postgraduate course content is reflecting emerging trends in the future world of work and Industry 5.0.</p><p>My Department will continue to align our further and higher education policies with what is required in the workplace. We will do this by working with industry to address current needs and, looking beyond the current world of work, by equipping individuals with the skills they need to succeed in the changing labour market.</p><p>I am satisfied that these and other important elements of my Department&rsquo;s strategies, developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, will help ensure that we are well prepared to meet our skills needs including the scientific needs of the economy.</p><p>Enrolments in Higher Education, by subject area, 2014 to 2018 <table>    <tr>       <th>Subject Area</th>       <th>2014/2015</th>       <th>2015/2016</th>       <th>2016/2017</th>       <th>2017/2018</th>       <th>2018/2019</th>       <th>Change 2014 - 2018</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Business, administration and law</td>       <td>40,086</td>       <td>42,612</td>       <td>42,643</td>       <td>44,876</td>       <td>47,876</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Welfare</td>       <td>35,820</td>       <td>36,661</td>       <td>37,543</td>       <td>38,634</td>       <td>39,645</td>       <td>11%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arts and Humanities</td>       <td>34,142</td>       <td>34,340</td>       <td>35,184</td>       <td>35,313</td>       <td>34,153</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Engineering, manufacturing and construction</td>       <td>23,439</td>       <td>24,101</td>       <td>24,154</td>       <td>24,830</td>       <td>25,490</td>       <td>9%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics</td>       <td>21,433</td>       <td>21,761</td>       <td>21,949</td>       <td>22,317</td>       <td>22,751</td>       <td>6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Information and Communcation Technologies (ICTs)</td>       <td>14,164</td>       <td>14,649</td>       <td>14,830</td>       <td>14,677</td>       <td>14,546</td>       <td>3%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social sciences, journalism and information</td>       <td>12,103</td>       <td>12,497</td>       <td>12,168</td>       <td>12,280</td>       <td>12,975</td>       <td>7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Education</td>       <td>11,521</td>       <td>12,994</td>       <td>13,323</td>       <td>14,509</td>       <td>15,606</td>       <td>35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services</td>       <td>10,748</td>       <td>10,891</td>       <td>10,688</td>       <td>10,436</td>       <td>9,205</td>       <td>-14%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture, forestry, fisheries and veterinary</td>       <td>3,732</td>       <td>3,649</td>       <td>3,662</td>       <td>3,795</td>       <td>3,893</td>       <td>4%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Generic programmes and qualifications</td>       <td>2,134</td>       <td>2,448</td>       <td>2,099</td>       <td>2,076</td>       <td>2,363</td>       <td>11%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>209,322</td>       <td>216,603</td>       <td>218,243</td>       <td>223,743</td>       <td>228,503</td>       <td>9%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

There are an additional 20 apprenticeships in development as of the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The level of qualifications encompassed by apprenticeship has broadened from the QQI level 6 national certificates linked to craft apprenticeship to new qualifications offered from level 5-10 of the national framework of qualifications (Where levels 9 and 10 are postgraduate level).  Two QQI level 9 programmes in the supply chain and logistics area were launched in 2019 followed by the first QQI level 10 apprenticeship, Principal Engineer, which was launched recently.  Five additional apprenticeships at level 9 are currently in development in the areas of construction, engineering, hospitality, finance and ICT.</p>  <p>  As a demand driven programme new apprenticeship development is dependent on an employer-led approach while the number of apprenticeship placements is determined by employers within any given sector.  The development of postgraduate level apprenticeships has now been established and the forthcoming Action Plan on Apprenticeship will build on the successes and learnings from both the craft and consortia-led approaches to ensure that apprenticeship will form a significant part of the Government&rsquo;s response to recovery from the COVID-19 crises and the development of a skilled workforce into the future. </p></reply>

From pre-primary through to further and higher education and throughout an individual&rsquo;s career, skills and knowledge need to be continuously enhanced if individuals, employers and countries are to realise their potential.</p>  <p>  The expansion of higher education has been a key enabling factor in the growth of the Irish economy over the past four decades. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career. Equally, increased participation in higher education has resulted in significant contributions to society and has played a critical role in enriching our cultural life. </p>  <p>  Postgraduate education delivered by higher education institutions is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s research system. In addition to contributing to knowledge, postgraduate researcher education drives participants to develop their own research and innovation skills that can be applied in a range of environments, in academia or industry, at home or abroad.</p>  <p>  Our society and the world of work are changing rapidly, and if anything, this will be accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Higher Education Institutions will have an important role in equipping us to manage this change. This will entail agility and innovation in how universities operate. The HEIs across the country responded to this challenge &ndash; providing support staff, equipment, delivering PPE, undertaking research into COVID-19, engaging our citizens through the media as experts and much more. The higher education sector was able to maintain teaching and learning in radically challenging circumstances and also demonstrated the flexibility to meet urgent needs, including the additional university places required following the Leaving Certificate.   What this crisis has shown us is the importance of having talent and skills to support our society and economy deal with the challenges we face. </p>  <p>  Challenge-led innovation is an increasingly important concept. Stimulating solutions driven collaboration will foster interdisciplinary consortia of enterprises, HEIs and public service delivery bodies to address major societal challenges. Interdisciplinary research is key to addressing such challenges, and incorporating the &lsquo;human factor&rsquo; is also vital. Societal challenges are typically highly complex, and the engagement of researchers from both Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths can often generate more innovative solutions and new ways of approaching and thinking about problems.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will mean that, in addition to public funding for higher and further education, well over 50% of national public research funding will be under its auspices. This is a great opportunity to bring further cohesion and balance to teaching and research across the further and higher education institutions to ensure that Ireland has the talent and skills to match the changing employment landscape and to keep pace with the advancement of science and build on our position as we aspire to become a global innovation leader.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 is due to conclude at the end of this year. The Mid-Term review of Innovation 2020 published last year reaffirmed the relevance of the policy objectives of Innovation 2020, including the need to increase investment in research infrastructure and research talent. As part of the consultation process for the successor strategy, which will be developed by my new department, I will work with enterprise agencies and industry groups, as well as the higher education institutes, to manage the future demand for research graduates to ensure we are prepared for the challenges we will face.</p></reply>

To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. </p>  <p>  The aim of the student maintenance grant is to make a contribution towards the cost of going to college and to assist students with their living costs while in college. The Student Grant Scheme is not prescriptive in how the maintenance grant is expended, it is at the student&rsquo;s discretion how it is utilised.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p>  <p>  The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions (HEI).</p>  <p>  The scheme will ensure:</p>  <p>  -  students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant;</p>  <p>  -  students who do not avail of the grant can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p>  <p>  -  In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges faced by students in relation to student accommodation this year due to financial pressures and the blended learning format of the 2020/21 academic year. Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  The university sector is already engaging with these issues, and all seven universities have confirmed that students who choose to vacate their university-owned accommodation early will receive pro-rata refunds. The exact details of these refunds vary by institution, and students are encouraged to engage with their university directly on this manner. I will continue to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation. </p>  <p>  For students in the private rental market, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p></reply>

Funding for the academic year 2021/2022 will be reviewed in line with the latest public health advice available. In this regard, a central contingency reserve has been established and will be used to allocate any agreed additional Covid financial supports to my Department for the remainder of 2021. </p></reply>

In 2020, 44,707 students in 26 higher education institutions participated. For the purposes of StudentSurvey.ie, student engagement reflects two key elements. The first is the amount of time and effort that students put into their studies and other educationally beneficial activities. The second is how institutions deploy resources and organise curriculum and learning opportunities to encourage students to participate in meaningful activities linked to learning. </p><p>According to the survey organisers, the insights provided by the approximately 245,000 respondents to the Student Survey over the last seven years are a rich source of inspiration and challenge and their value to individual institutions and at a national level needs to continue to be mined in creative and constructive ways.</p><p>The full report is available at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

In realising Ireland&rsquo;s aim to have the best education and training service in Europe within a decade, we must provide the most effective and engaging teaching, learning and assessment environment for STEM education at all levels. The STEM implementation plan builds on a range of reforms and initiatives already underway in STEM, in areas such as curriculum and assessment reform, teacher professional development, embedding digital learning and advances in initial teacher education.</p><p>Increasing the numbers of females in STEM is a key action in the STEM Education Implementation Plan. There is a need to attract more females into STEM subjects at school level and ensure that they engage in STEM courses at higher or further education. At further and higher education there is a need for a focus on retention as there is a higher attrition rate for females leaving STEM careers than for males. </p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has forecast that the number of research personnel employed within our knowledge-intensive industries will increase from 25,000 to 40,000 in the next four years. Thus increasing demand for graduates with STEM-related skills and qualifications across different sectors of the economy. Greater retention in STEM courses at Further and Higher Education will ensure that we have qualified people with the right skills to attract job opportunities and investment in these sectors. <table>

It was proposed that, upon completion, Block F could be used to accommodate persons detained for immigration purposes so that they would be separate from other remand prisoners. </p>  <p>  The outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic required significant measures within IPS to manage and control infection risk, and it was necessary to re-purpose Block F as an isolation unit for those prisoners who have, or are suspected of having, the virus.

I intend to publish and start to implement an Action Plan to tackle economic crime and corruption early in the New Year, which I have secured Government approval to do. </p><p>I would like to thank the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, and the members of his Review Group for their meticulous work in preparing their detailed report, which I am determined to act on. </p><p>Corruption and &lsquo;white-collar crime&rsquo; damages our economy, breeds cynicism in our society and is a threat to our international reputation. As noted in the detailed report recently published, Ireland is a relatively small country with a population approaching 5 million. However, Ireland is listed as the fifth largest provider of wholesale financial services in the EU with more than 400 international financial institutions located here. The State and its agencies must have all the powers available to clamp down and prevent this type of crime. </p><p>Ireland has a hard won reputation as an attractive destination for foreign direct investment and as an international business hub and stepping up our efforts to tackle white collar crime shows we&rsquo;re serious about maintaining and building that reputation. </p><p>Businesses large and small must be confident they can operate safely and securely, particularly as more economic activity goes online, a trend we have seen accelerate with COVID-19. But it is not just about businesses, consumers too should know they can safely pay their bills and shop online. </p><p>The recommendations in the  Hamilton Review focus primarily on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement as well as increasing capacity across the criminal justice system to prevent this crime. Examples of the recommendations include: greater powers for investigating agencies to tackle economic crime and corruption; the establishment of an Advisory Council against Economic Crime and Corruption; reform of the Ethics Acts; and additional resourcing for SIPO, DPP, Garda National and Economic Crime Bureau. </p><p>The Programme for Government recognises the reputational and economic damage that corruption and white collar crime can cause to the State and commits the Government to introduce and implement new anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures. </p><p>The development of our new plan to tackle economic crime and corruption will be informed by the recommendations of the Hamilton review. Work has already begun across Government to develop this action plan, which will set clear timelines for the introduction of a series of reforms to strengthen the State&rsquo;s capacity to prevent and prosecute white-collar crime. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that Garda&iacute; have the resources, both in terms of people and technology, to combat all forms of crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021. This level of funding is enabling sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff as well as driving significant developments in ICT.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) is the main Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tasked with tackling economic crime. The Bureau operates on a national basis and provides specialist support and guidance to regional investigators.</p><p>I understand that there are currently competitions underway to strengthen the staffing levels in the GNECB&rsquo;s Financial Intelligence Unit and the GNECB itself as well as the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. This includes 11 new permanent Detective Sergeants who are due to be allocated to the GNECB this month, with additional resources expected in 2021.</p><p>I can also advise the Deputy that there have been a number of significant steps taken in recent years to strengthen the State&rsquo;s ability to tackle corruption and related activities. In particular, the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 is a very important piece of legislation in the fight against corruption, both in Ireland and abroad. Further information relating to the Act and the Government&rsquo;s cross-Departmental approach to tackling corruption and bribery can be found on www.anticorruption.ie.</p></reply>

A White Paper is due to be published by Minister O&rsquo;Gorman shortly, informed by the report of the Advisory Group, setting out options, together with the recommended direction, for a new model of accommodation and services for International Protection applicants, including proposals for streamlining the processing of applications. The White Paper proposal will involve actions by multiple government departments, including my own, and set out the approach to addressing recommendations such as that raised by the Deputy which are still under consideration.  </p>  <p>  My Department is already progressing actions to deliver on many of the recommendations.  A high level Programme Board, chaired by the Deputy Secretary General, has been established in my Department to oversee and drive forward the implementation of recommendations that relate to my Department and the agencies under its aegis, as appropriate.  In addition, an Implementation Working Group of senior officials from the responsible areas is tasked with working together to support the implementation of actions and to plan for their delivery. Detailed consideration of each of the recommendations is still ongoing. This includes considering actions to achieve more efficient timelines in processing and deciding applications, and legislation that may be required to support such changes.  </p>  <p>  I can advise that the work processes of the Ministerial Decision Unit (MDU) have already been streamlined and the MDU has been relocated to the International Protection Office in line with the Advisory Group recommendations.</p></reply>

Longford, I would emphasise that our cross sector approach to addressing domestic abuse is an all-encompassing national approach.</p><p>I am acutely aware of the increase, particularly in domestic abuse incidents which is evident in figures reported by frontline services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the courts and by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p>Our collective prioritising in providing additional resources during the pandemic was to ensure we have a comprehensive and holistic approach to the provision of services for victims of domestic abuse in a time of unprecedented demand.</p><p>My department ensured that additional resources, support, enforcement and services were made available to key organisations in this area. This support is maintained and increased in budget 2021. I can assure the Deputy that domestic abuse was of primary consideration in the context of the move to level 5 in the National Framework for Living with Covid-19.  </p><p>To expand and improve how we deliver services, the Programme for Government commits to an audit of how responsibility for Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) is segmented across different government agencies. </p><p>The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and a procurement process to engage an independent person to undertake the audit has commenced with details available on my Department's website.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that, over the last decade, work in this area has been conducted through successive DSGBV strategies. My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Abuse 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. </p><p>The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.  </p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based abuse and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. </p><p>Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.</p><p>Raising public awareness on these issues is a key feature of our overarching response in this area and my Department is currently midway through the No Excuses campaign, a national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual abuse and sexual harassment. The campaign is a key action of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based abuse for 2016 to 2021. The overall aim of the campaign is to make all of us face up to the excuses we, as a society, make for unacceptable behaviours and to call on us to speak out against them. This will contribute to a change in society's attitude to sexual harassment, domestic and sexual abuse in order to decrease and prevent this type of behaviour. </p><p>In relation to funding, in 2020 my Department committed almost &euro;1.9 million to support services for victims of crime, including victims of sexual and gender based violence.  These services provide important information and support to victims of crime, including emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews and to sexual assault treatment units, counselling and referral to other services. I have secured &euro;4.104 million under Budget 2021 to continue supporting these services.  I have also secured &euro;3 million in Budget 2021 for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  </p><p>These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 to support the implementation of the O'Malley review which will support vulnerable victims, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. </p><p><i>&lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo;</i>will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. I am aware that Longford/Roscommon launched its DPSU on 21 September, 2020. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual abuse present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and sensitive expert assistance.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy, but more importantly to reassure anyone who is a victim, or at risk of domestic abuse, that help continues to be available and to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The pragmatic approach to deportation orders will continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  A decision to suspend the issuing of negative international protection decisions during level 5 restrictions had already been taken and this remains in place.  Under the International Protection Act 2015, a person receives a letter informing them of their negative international protection decision and informing them that they no longer have permission to remain in the State. They are required to confirm within 5 days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which my Department will provide assistance. The person is not required to remove themselves from the State within 5 days, they are merely required to give an indication of their intentions. </p>  <p>  For the duration of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, I asked my officials to review the issuing of the letters; and no refusal letters, or letters enclosing a deportation order, have issued to anyone who has been unsuccessful in seeking international protection since. </p>  <p>  I wish to add that, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, there have only been four cases where a person was deported from the State and three of those arose from deportation orders issued prior to March 2020. For the one case where the deportation order was issued since March 2020, that person was returned to Brazil and was not a failed international protection applicant.  </p>  <p>  In terms of those found not to be in need of international protection, a detailed consideration of all aspects of their case will have been carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order. This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues. </p>  <p>If a Deportation Order is subsequently made, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.  In making a revocation request a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.  </p></reply>

The Optional Protocol to the Convention (OPCAT) dates from 2007; it is in addition to the Convention and is designed to be preventive in nature. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a signatory to the protocol and will ratify it once the necessary legislation is in place to provide for National Preventative Mechanisms (NPMs) to inspect and monitor places of detention for the purposes of the protocol. The current situation, which was recently communicated to the Council of Europe Committee against Torture is as follows. </p>  <p>  The Government has committed in its Programme for Government to ratifying OPCAT before the end of 2021. My predecessor Minister Flanagan approved our intended approach in that the Inspector of Prisons is to be designated as a single NPM for the Criminal Justice Sector &ndash; places of detention, including Garda stations, courts, prisons, places of transport and transit between Garda stations, prisons and courts. </p>  <p>  The matter of designating NPMs to oversee those relevant areas of detention outside the Criminal Justice Sector is a matter for the Minister for Health and the Minister for Defence and from the consultations my officials have had, I understand those Departments are considering the appropriate designations in this regard.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, It is anticipated that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) will be designated as the coordinating body for NPMs in this State. </p>  <p>  My Department is leading on the preparation for this multiple institution NPM model in terms of developing the necessary legislation for ratification of OPCAT. To this end, the General Scheme of the Inspection of Places of Detention Bill is being drafted and it is intended to bring this to Government for approval in the first quarter of 2021.  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to supporting the Office of the Inspector of Prisons in implementing its statutory role. The Inspector of Prisons engaged an independent consultant to assess the resources needed for their office.  The review set out the need for a future Preferred Operational Model (&ldquo;POM&rdquo;) to be implemented, supported by enhanced resourcing. It went further to recommended increasing the staff numbers from 5 to 14 staff (including the Chief Inspector).  Acknowledging this, the 2020 budget was increased by &euro;700,000 bringing it to &euro;1.2million and the 2021 budget by a further circa &euro;750,000 bringing the overall budget for the OIP to &euro;1.95 million. These increases allow the Inspector of Prisons to recruit additional staff. </p>  <p>  Competitions for the recruitment of additional staff are nearly completed. This will significantly increase the capacity of the office from its current capacity. My Department will continue to work with the Inspector of Prisons in this regard and in that Office&rsquo;s additional responsibilities and obligations that will flow from the ratification of OPCAT.</p></reply>

The process of conducting this review, and the question of its publication or the publication of any part of it are of course matters solely for the Commissioner and his management team.</p>  <p>  Anti-spit guards have been deployed on relatively few occasions during the COVID-19 emergency.  I fully appreciate the concerns that have been raised, however, it is important to note that the deployment of this equipment has been very limited, and that there are clear safeguards and monitoring in place, including through the oversight of Garda use by the Policing Authority in regular published reporting.</p>  <p>  I am looking forward to receiving the results of this review, and to the further discussions that will take place over the use of anti-spit guards on foot of its recommendations.

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels to pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p><p>Currently the Bureau is conducting investigations into individuals and Organised Criminal Groups involved in the following types of crime:</p><p>-  Sale and Supply of Controlled Drugs</p><p>-  Burglaries, Theft, Fraud</p><p>-  Stolen vehicles </p><p>-  Stolen and counterfeit vehicle parts</p><p>-  Various offences related to the used car motor trade</p><p>-  Sale of encrypted devices to criminal groups</p><p>-  International Mail Fraud scam</p><p>-  Ghost Motor Insurance Brokers</p><p>-  Insurance Fraud</p><p>-  Bogus Tradesmen involved in defrauding the vulnerable and elderly, particularly in relation to house repairs, roofing and tarring driveways</p><p>-  Prostitution</p><p>-  People Smuggling/Human Trafficking </p><p>-  Fuel Smuggling</p><p>-  Illegal Tobacco Trade</p><p>-  Illegal Dumping</p><p>-  Extortion, Blackmail, False Imprisonment and Harassment</p><p>Since its establishment in 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is recognised as a world leader in asset investigations, tracing and forfeiture.  As a part of its prescribed statutory function, it currently provides national and international assistance and education to other law enforcement / regulatory agencies and State bodies, including the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) of the United States of America, the AFP (Australian Federal Police) and the National Agency of Ukraine for Finding, Tracing and Management of Assets derived from Corruption and Other Crime.</p><p>The Bureau is included as a member in two Joint Investigation Teams (JIT&rsquo;s) since 2019, established in accordance with Article 20 of the Second Additional Protocol of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p><p>With regard to the details of the activities of the Bureau, these are reported on each year in its Annual Report. These Annual Reports can be found at www.cab.ie.</p><p>The 2019 Annual Report was published by the Department of Justice and Equality and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 25 June 2020.</p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. </p>  <p>  As previously indicated to the Deputy, public safety is an absolute priority for me as Minister for Justice.  Working to reduce re-offending and minimise the risk of further harm to victims and society, through the implementation of effective evidence-based penal policy, is a key part of that task.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that a number of initiatives were introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC). Community Return and Community Support Schemes were introduced in 2011 and aim to increase support for prisoners prior to their release from prison, upon their release, and then for a period after their release in order to break the cycle of offending; </p>  <p>  The Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) is a multi-agency response to the supervision and rehabilitation of offenders which commenced in 2014. The programme aims to target prolific offenders who are responsible for large amounts of crime. In order to reduce crime and enhance public safety, the selected prolific offenders are managed through the integration of policy and practice between the J-ARC agencies.</p>  <p>  While I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is challenging to relate the impact any one action or any specific legislation has to general re-offending rates as recidivism may be impacted by a number of other variables, such as social influences or other external factors. However, an example of the impact of legislation in this area is the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011. This Act provides that a court shall consider the appropriateness of a community service order in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of up to 12 months is being considered.  There has been a consistent increase in the management of community service orders by the Probation Service over the past three years. In 2019, the Probation Service managed 2,791 Community Service Orders, totalling 379,815 hours work, in lieu of 1,247 years in prison, which equated to &euro;3 million of unpaid work.  Despite this, the use of short sentences is something that I am continuing to focus on as their use remains prevalent.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department launched the findings from an international evidence review on recidivism and policy responses. This research report is the third in a series of releases to be commissioned and disseminated by the Research and Data Analytics unit in my Department, was prepared by Prof. Ian O&rsquo;Donnell from the Institute of Criminology and Criminal Justice, School of Law, UCD. </p>  <p>  The review sought to address a range of questions relating to the factors underpinning recidivist and prolific offending behaviour; public policy interventions that tackle recidivism and prolific offending; and the effectiveness of these interventions and likelihood of successful transplantation to an Irish context.</p>  <p>  The review will constitute a valuable resource for researchers and act as a springboard for future empirical research on best practice in this area and provide a body of evidence essential to inform future policy discussions and development. The full report, including key finding, is available on the website of my Department and builds on the Department&rsquo;s commitment, outlined in the 2018-2020 Data and Research Strategy, to support the development of more evidence-informed policy making.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more. The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken. Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and increases the use of curfews.</p></reply>

If an individual re-offends on temporary release, the matter of their prosecution is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that the information requested by the Deputy would take a disproportionate amount of time and resources to gather. It is not currently readily accessible and in a manner which can be easily collated at this time.  However, I have undertaken to discuss this matter further with my officials to ascertain what type of information may be available and will revert to the Deputy when I have done so. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Central Statistics Office (CSO) use data from the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop comprehensive prison re-offending indicators and in order to be of some assistance to the Deputy, the following statistics on recidivism in respect of offences committed on release from custody may be helpful. </p>  <p>  The three-year re-offending indicator counts prisoners who re-offended within three years of release from custody, and who secured a court conviction within a further two years. </p>  <p>  The latest reoffending statistics produced by the CSO demonstrate that prison re-offending rate has been in decline from 2011 to 2017. </p>  <p>  Looking at the three year re-offending rate, 55.2% of prisoners released in 2014 re-offended within three years of release, an 8.6% decrease on re-offending levels of 63.8% for prisoners released in 2011. </p>  <p>Further information and statistical information is available on the website of the Central Statistics Office at www.cso.ie  .</p></reply>

This information can be found in the Information Centre section under &quot;Statistics and Information - Census Reports&quot; at www.irishprisons.ie.</p><p>According to the latest available report (dated 20 Oct 2020) there were:  </p><p>3,768 prisoners in custody -</p><p>-  1,964 (52%) cells accommodated one prisoner (1,895 Male) (69 Female). </p><p>-  749 cells accommodated two prisoners (1,498 prisoners) (1,416 Male, 82 Female).</p><p>-  79 cells accommodated three prisoners (237 prisoners) (234 Male, 3 Female).</p><p>-  22 cells accommodated four or more prisoners  (69 male prisoners).</p><p>Given the current number of prisoners in custody the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners.  Single cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety.</p><p>I am further advised that in some cases prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity.  Family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell. Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.  </p></reply>

It seeks to manage sentences in a way which encourages and supports prisoners in their efforts to live law abiding and purposeful lives on release.</p>  <p>  I understand that a wide range of rehabilitative programmes are provided to those in custody  including education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, addiction counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes, which are available in all prisons and to all prisoners, including first time offenders, can offer purposeful activity to those in custody while serving their sentences.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Prison Psychology Service proactively target specific cohorts of prisoners including for example, violent offenders with over two year sentence, as well as 18-24 year olds in custody. </p>  <p>  Assistant Psychologists have been recruited since 2016. Their focus is primarily on mental health and sentence management work with prisoners. They are tasked with engaging and motivating this cohort of prisoners, who are committed to custody on a sentence of one year or more and who do not have a post-release supervision order to develop a sentence plan and to engage in appropriate interventions.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that the Probation Service have joined this initiative by engaging in assessments with those 18-24 year olds who have post release supervision orders. </p>  <p>  The strategic objective to have a multi-agency approach to offender management and rehabilitation from pre to post imprisonment in order to reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes, forms a central part of the Prison and Probation Service Joint Strategic Plan 2018 - 2020.  </p>  <p>  There is a clear commitment to enhance sentence planning through Integrated Sentence Management and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes.  The Joint IPS/ETBI Education Strategy 2019 - 2021 sets out a commitment to the provision of broad based education provision and includes supporting integration and sentence planning. </p>  <p>  Education in prisons is delivered in partnership between the Education Training Boards and the Prison Service with a focus on providing education which is quality assured, student centred and which facilitates lifelong learning. A broad and flexible curriculum is provided.    </p>  <p>  Other areas where there has been significant progress in prison education are in physical education, in the provision for higher education, in the arts and in preparing people for release.  A top priority for the Service is ensuring help for those with literacy problems, and to this end, peer mentoring programmes are currently active in all prisons. </p>  <p>  The guiding principles which underpin the prisons' work and training service are to make available, work, work-training and other purposeful activities to all those in custody.  Training activities are chosen to give as much variety as possible and also to give opportunities for those in prison to acquire practical skills which will help them secure employment on release. Occupational activities such as craft based skills and picture framing are also available.  Work Training Officers have been appointed and assigned to areas such as catering, laundry, industrial cleaning, industrial skills and gym. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to state that the Prison Service has also been expanding the number of accredited courses and opportunities available to prisoners in Work Training in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies such as City and Guilds, the Guild of Cleaners and Launderers and Cleanpass and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the prison service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification to people in custody. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I recently launched in the "Working to Change Social Enterprise Strategy - 2021-2023". The strategy sets out my Department&rsquo;s direction for supporting employment options for people with convictions by simultaneously working to remove the systemic barriers so that people can make sustainable changes. It builds upon a solid foundation of employment supports already in place across the criminal justice sector and is a collaboration between the Prison and the Probation Service and my Department of Justice. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are various employment focussed interventions which take place along the criminal justice spectrum for those in custody, those preparing for release and for those engaging in Probation funded projects in the community. In addition, people with convictions can avail of the programmes provided through Government Agencies which support training, employment and entrepreneurship. The strategy aims to create a flexible, responsive system that ties all of these interventions together in a coherent, strategic and progressive manner with each intervention building on the previous ones, for the benefit of people with convictions and communities they return to.</p>  <p>  A copy of the Strategy can be found on my Departmental website.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; over the last nine months as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that detailed information in relation to Community Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures.</p></reply>

This has resulted in over 10,000 patients switching and has achieved savings in excess of &euro;35 million, to date.  </p>  <p>  While progress has been positive, the Department of Health and HSE are continuously monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of current levers to ensure that the State can capitalise on the most efficient policy approach.</p>  <p>  There is value and savings to be gained from the adoption of biosimilars technology, however, progress in this area has to be carefully planned and implemented, with patient&rsquo;s confidence and assurance at the forefront of any new initiatives and developments. It is not comparable to consider biosimilars and generics in the same context. They are different medical technologies with different care pathways for patients.</p>  <p>  Despite the impediment of Covid-19, the HSE are progressing well in achieving savings in this area whilst maintaining the engagement of clinicians and the confidence of patients in the safety and efficacy of this technology.</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.</p><p>Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. </p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>With regard to weddings and funerals, restrictions apply at all Levels and these restrictions are set out in the Plan. At present, in Level 3, weddings can go ahead with a limit of 25 guests while up to 25 mourners may attend funerals. </p><p>The Plan is clear that sectoral guidance also applies and in the case of weddings, guidance from F&aacute;ilte Ireland should also be considered: .</p></reply>

I also secured funding under the Budget to maintain this increase in 2021. </p>  <p>  The funding will be used to augment staffing levels so that  adults that currently live at home with their families will receive an average of an additional day of service at a day service location over and above what they have been receiving since day services resumed in August.

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation. We now have on-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, which can be increased to 140,000 per week if the demand requires.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Sars-Cov2 does not confirm that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person.</p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority recently published a rapid Health Technology Assessment (HTA) into antigen testing. The review confirmed that antigen tests available to date show reduced diagnostic accuracy compared with RT-PCR but more recently developed tests are worth validating now in Ireland. Following the completion of the HTA, the National Public Health Emergency Team asked the HSE to establish an Antigen Project Validation Working Group, the aim of which is to validate the antigen tests in the market and evaluate the public health deployment options. Work is ongoing in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of NPHET. NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions. </p>  <p>  In September, Minister Donnelly and I announced that &euro;7.5 million is being made available in 2020 to increase disability day services by one day a week for 14,940 adults. I also secured funding under the Budget to maintain this increase in 2021. </p>  <p>  The funding will be used to augment staffing levels so that  adults that currently live at home with their families will receive an average of an additional day of service at a day service location over and above what they have been receiving since day services resumed in August.

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  I have communicated with the sector outlining the need for them to be flexible, innovative and to facilitate visiting arrangements, in line with public health advice.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19<sup>th</sup>November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities across Europe. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community.  </p><p>This highlights the importance of suppressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>The Government's medium-term Plan Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months.</p><p>The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. </p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>The measures in place at each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.  </p><p>I would like to draw your attention to the CSO website for access to a range of data relating to Covid-19 including data on confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to outbreak location. This is available on the CSO Covid-19 Information Hub at www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-covid19/covid-19informationhub/ and, in particular, at:-  </p><p>A range of data on the epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland, including data on trends in transmission, is also published in the daily report by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/epidemiologyofcovid-19inireland, while a daily report on the last 14 days in cases available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/epidemiologyofcovid-19inireland.</p></reply>

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  </p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. </p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. </p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. </p>  <p>   I have recently committed to holding an inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland, and have asked officials in my department to examine a number of different options for the structure of this inquiry.</p></reply>

This addition to the medical staff will allow for an increased number of patients to be seen, diagnosed and treatment initiated, as part of the comprehensive Rheumatology service.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of MRI services, the demand for specialist imaging has increased over recent years due to increased activity and acuity in CHI, as well as an increasing trend to utilise imaging in diagnosis and treatment.  CHI have advised that, uniquely to Paediatrics, younger children and children up to 18 years old with complex needs may be unable to remain still in an MRI for the lengthy periods required to complete the scan, resulting in the requirement for a General Anaesthetic (GA) to be delivered by a Paediatric Anaesthesiologist.  This limits the ability for these scans to be performed outside of CHI hospitals. CHI have confirmed to my Department that each request for an MRI scan is carefully examined by Consultant Radiologists who must prioritise, based on clinical urgency, each case in terms of access to the scanner. </p>  <p>  CHI has advised that patients with Down Syndrome who present to Rheumatology services with suspicion of arthritis are clinically assessed and diagnosed by the clinical team. A cohort of these patients will require an MRI scan based on the individualised clinical examination and recommendation.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy regarding a meeting between the Rheumatology Department at CHI Crumlin and the organisation referred to in the details supplied, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others. Dancing is not permitted given the close contact involved. Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of Covid-19. </p><p>Details of the public health measures in place for weddings at level 3 can be found at:- </p><p>Guidance for religious services can be found at:- https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7ba40-guidance-for-religious-services/ </p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - </p></reply>

This is achieved through an on-going monthly performance management process where the HSE reports against the targets set out in the Service Plan.

This outlines that my Department must write to the Health Service Executive to notify it of its allocation not later than 21 days after the publication by the Government of the Estimates for Public Services. The legislation further provides that, on receipt of the letter of this determination, the Executive has 21 days to prepare and submit its Service Plan for Ministerial approval.</p>  <p>  In terms of colonoscopy services, a national programme was established in mid-2016 to coordinate several activities to improve endoscopy services.

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation. We now have on-island capacity to test up to 126,000 people per week, which can be increased to 140,000 per week if the demand requires.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Sars-Cov2 does not confirm that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person. HSE guidelines also advise that anyone who has been tested in these circumstances should also restrict their movements for 14 days. </p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of NPHET. On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Endocrinology and psychological support services are delivered on both sites. A model of care was developed to support the development of HSE gender identity services. The model of care was supported by the allocation of additional resources to enhance services.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer most scheduled care activity in March, April, and May of this year. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation.  </p>  <p>  If the National Gender Service (NGS) identifies someone who is at high risk of harm with regard to their social health as a result of hormone therapy, then an individualised care plan is formulated to reduce this risk.  </p>  <p>  This care plan may in some very specific instances include family meetings (with relevant family members such as parents). The NGS offers a variety of interventions to address any social health risk involving personal relationships. This can include family meetings at HSE offices, home visits from a member of the NGS team, family therapy, or/and individualised social work intervention (e.g. securing independent housing or income). The rationale of the care plan is explained to the individual during and following assessment. At all times during this process, data protection regulations are fully observed and all clinicians work in line with the relevant professional guidelines.  </p>  <p>  This care plan can be experienced by the person attending the service as an insistence that they bring their parents with them to approve their plans for hormonal or surgical transition. However, parents have no say in the person's care. As long as the person has capacity to consent then they can proceed to medical intervention once they can say, based on clinical assessment, that the benefits will exceed the risks.  </p>  <p>  If parents of patients are not supportive, or if the person does not want to involve their parents in their care, then the HSE works with them to secure independent income and housing prior to proceeding to a medical transition.  </p>  <p>  Irish health insurers are required to have a standard minimum level of cover in every health insurance policy. These requirements are set out in the Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts. In addition to this minimum level of cover, it is open to insurers to provide cover for procedures beyond the requirements set out in governing legislation.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health and I are committed to the development by the HSE of a well-governed and patient-centred health care service for adults and children in the transgender community. We will support the HSE in ensuring that people wishing to transition their gender have timely access to treatment that accords with international best practice.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Strategy&rsquo;s key aims of reducing negative sexual health outcomes for everyone living in Ireland. Implementation of the Strategy is led by the HSE&rsquo;s Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP). </p>  <p>  A key initiative under the Strategy was the provision of &euro;5.4m funding for the establishment of a national programme of PrEP in 2019. This has been progressed, although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to interruptions to normal healthcare activity, with most services affected, including those providing PrEP.</p>  <p>  Virtual clinics are held where possible, with attendance in person limited to appointment only. Service restrictions are predominantly due to social distancing requirements; waiting rooms can now only hold a fraction of patients compared to before the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as man2man.ie and sexual wellbeing.ie are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved PrEP services. </p>  <p>  Although services have been subject to some Covid-19 related restrictions, the PrEP programme has continued to expand and over 2,000 individuals, mostly gay men, are currently registered on the national PrEP programme.  </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This is in line with other European countries.</p>  <p>  There are no plans in place to pay students in health and social care professional roles for their time spent on placement as part of their academic course. </p>  <p>  Uniquely for student nurses and midwives there is, in the final year, a paid salary when they are specifically employed on an internship placement.  Student nurses and midwives&rsquo; final year internship placement consists of a continual 36-week rostered clinical placement, including annual leave. The internship placement is a paid placement as the student nurses and midwives take a reduced caseload. During these placements, students are under supervision and are considered as 0.5 WTE of the workforce.  In addition, Intern students can be allocated across all shift patterns including nights, weekends and 12-hour days. </p></reply>

It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p>  <p>   The Government&rsquo;s medium-term Strategy Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19, sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19, in a range of areas, over a period of 6 &ndash; 9 months. </p>  <p>  The Plan aims to allow society and businesses to operate as normally as possible, while protecting our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p>  <p>  The Plan consists of 5 levels. Each level sets out what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services, at that moment in time.  Each level contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering the risk of transmission of Covid-19 in alignment with the risk level at that time. The set of measures, individually, do not comprise a list of activities or places which are equally safe.  Instead, they are &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; of measures which are informed by public health understanding of the disease. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p>  <p>   As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The numbers of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Plan are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p>  <p>  Dance classes are regarded as exercise and sporting events under the Plan and where possible, such classes can be held online.</p>  <p>  Under Levels 3, 4 and 5 indoor training is only permitted on an individual basis, therefore exercise and sporting events, including classes, cannot take place.</p>  <p>  Under Level 2 restrictions, indoor classes, training and exercise can take place in pods of up to 6 people, once sufficient space is available and strict public health protocols are in place.</p>  <p>  Under Level 1 of the Framework, there is no specific capacity limit, with capacity guided by what can be accommodated safely in the venue while ensuring all protective measures are in place, including social distancing. </p></reply>

The Department has included detailed information under each head to allow for expert input from the Mental Health Commission and the HSE to be provided prior to publication, to allow the Department the opportunity to address any concerns as early as possible in the process. The draft heads of bill propose to extensively amend and update existing mental health legislation, moving from what has been described as a paternalistic approach in existing statute, to a more person-centred, human rights-based approach. The Department is currently awaiting further input from the HSE, which is expected in early December and plans to finalise the draft heads prior to submission for internal legal advice, and to the office of the Attorney General, as required, in early 2021.</p>  <p>  A new Part of the Act related to children is being advanced separately, and the Department has approached the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Ombudsman for Children and the College of Psychiatrists for their expert opinions on the draft heads. The Department received the Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s initial input in June 2020, and further observations in November. The Department expects to receive submissions from the other stakeholders in December 2020, and will then finalise the draft heads related to children at the same time as the rest of the heads.</p></reply>

Allocations are made available to fishing vessels based on an overall policy framework which has been developed over the past 30 years.  The key commercial whitefish quotas (cod, haddock, monk, hake etc) are managed, usually on a monthly basis, with maximum catch limits set for vessels.  Pelagic stocks such as mackerel and herring are managed on an annual or seasonal basis in accordance with the  Ministerial policy.That policy has been developed and set down over the years as the relevant fishery developed.  Any amendments or changes to the policy on management arrangements are determined by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine following detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders.</p><p>Within the Minister&rsquo;s policy, allocations and other arrangements are decided by the Minister on an ongoing basis having regard for the advice of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC).  </p><p>Consultation is carried out at the monthly meeting of the QMAC involving representatives of the industry (each of the four Producer Organisations, Co-operatives, National Inshore Fisheries Forum and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association), the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority. The purpose of these meetings is for the industry representatives to make recommendations to the Minister on monthly catch limits for stocks, mainly demersal stocks.I  have regard for the recommendations when setting catch limits and arrangements for a fishery, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries. </p><p>I attach an Excel document presenting the quotas  by fish stock for Ireland in each of years 2001 to 2020, which was compiled for me by the Marine Institute. The initial quota received by Ireland is presented in the first tab and a revised quota, to take account of swaps, is presented in the second tab of this document.

At the time we see fish in the Irish zone there are also fish being caught in the international high seas  and over a wide area from Spain to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.  </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna.  The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s.  At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  </p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch.</p>  <p>  In 2018,  Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data.  A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data  on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters. </p>  <p>  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU.  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no liklihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU.  This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would give up a share of their allocation to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As regards Anchovy, this species is sometimes caught in the waters around Ireland, although its abundance in catches is highly variable.  Fishing for Anchovy in Area 8 (Bay of Biscay) and Area 9a (Atlantic-Iberian waters) is regulated by the TAC and Quota system.  In recent years, the distribution of Anchovy has expanded into areas not currently covered by TACs and this is thought to be the result of changes in temperature.  In the past, sporadic increases in abundance of Anchovy have been followed by periods of near absence.  Some fishermen have reported catches in two separate locations south of Cape Clear and in Dingle bay recently.   </p>  <p>  At this time, there is no proposal from the EU Commission for a TAC and quota management arrangement for this stock in the waters around Ireland.   I will of course have regard for a possible TAC and quota regime or other appropriate conservation measures going forward if  recommended in the scientific advice to support the sustainable management of the stock.</p>  <p>  The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process when there is clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.   At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   </p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.   </p></reply>

In addition, my Department also has responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of North Harbour at Cape Clear, as well as the maintenance of a small number of specific piers, lights and beacons throughout Ireland, in accordance with the Marine Works (Ireland) Act 1902, and piers, lights and beacons constructed under the auspices of the Congested Districts Board.</p>  <p>  The six Fishery Harbour Centres are the essential infrastructure that underpin the Government&rsquo;s Seafood Strategy. Approximately 85% of all fish landed in Ireland are landed at the Fishery Harbour Centres. The Centres are strategically located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Ros a Mh&iacute;l to further develop a modern offshore Irish fishing fleet and attract the large offshore fishing vessels of other Member States to maximise landings and drive the development of a modern onshore processing industry. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the development and maintenance of Local Authority owned piers, harbours and slipways rests with each Local Authority in the first instance, and their parent Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, thereafter.</p>  <p>  To provide for the necessary safety, maintenance and ongoing development of the six Fishery Harbour Centres, my Department administers the annual Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Capital Development Programme.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-10a.1306.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020121000080#WRT04400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 468, 469, 470 and 471 together.</p>  <p>There are certain stocks for which ICES (the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) has issued scientific advice for no catches.  However, the Landing Obligation requires that if these stocks are caught, even as a by-catch, they must be landed.  These by-catch stocks in the Celtic Sea, the Irish Sea and the North West occur as by-catches in our mixed whitefish fisheries, therefore, if a zero Total Allowable Catch (TAC) were set, this would lead to the closure of entire fisheries.</p>  <p>  Last year, in order to reduce catches of depleted stocks in mixed fisheries, the Council agreed to set restrictive Total Allowable Catches (TACs) to allow for unavoidable by-catches of these stocks.  In order to reduce the catches of stocks for which by-catch TACs were set, the TACs for the other stocks in the fisheries in which these vulnerable stocks are caught were set at levels that help the biomass of the vulnerable stocks recover to sustainable levels.  In addition, these measures were complemented by the adoption of remedial technical measures in the Celtic Sea and the continuation of such measures in the Irish Sea and the North-West. </p>  <p>  For 2020, remedial measures were agreed by Member States in respect of Celtic Sea cod and whiting, recognising these stocks were below biological reference points and measures were needed to bring these stocks back above the level capable of producing MSY, in accordance with the Western Waters multiannual plan (Regulation (EU) 2019/472). Such measures were designed to improve selectivity by requiring the use of gear that have lower levels of by-catches of cod and whiting in the areas where such catches are significant, thus decreasing the fishing mortality of this stock in mixed fisheries. The TACs set for these species were set at a level designed to avoid potential discarding, which could undermine data collection and scientific assessment of the stock and to ensure rapid return of the stock to levels capable of producing MSY. </p>  <p>  The Commission requested its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) to review the impacts of these remedial measures and to assess the ongoing measures proposed by the North Western Waters Group of Member States, of which Ireland is a member. In their findings, STECF noted that the measures  proposed should as a minimum lead to benefits for the conservation of marine biological resources by reducing the catches of juveniles. However, STECF did note that to carry out a full analysis, disaggregated quantitative data specific to the fisheries studied are needed. Monitoring of catch data by fishing operation or trip (including levels of discards) from the fishery is required to estimate the proportion and total volume of historical catches of by-catch species below or above the given catch thresholds specified in the Regulation. This will provide accurate data on the levels of by-catch of cod and whiting and identify the vessels that have by-catches of a sufficient level to require the use of the selective gears set out in the Regulation. Following on from the STECF advice, the Commission has requested that Member States provide such information in order to allow such an assessment to be carried out. Ireland is working with the other Member States to supply such information based on observer data provided by the Marine Institute and logbook data provided from the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA). </p>  <p>  With regards to additional control measures to ensure by-catch TACs are enforced, the EU Commission has proposed amendments to the EU Fisheries control framework. Negotiations on the new Fisheries Control Regulation are currently ongoing in both the EU Council and the European Parliament.  Some of the measures being considered include provisions for full catch documentation, such as Remote Electronic Monitoring (REM) which involves, for example the use of CCTV cameras on vessels.  Ireland is supportive of the proposed introduction of a risk-based REM system.  As a Coastal Member State, Ireland supports this proposal provided that Coastal States has access to the data gathered within this system on a near real time basis to support the work of the control authorities.  </p></reply>

To date in 2020, officers from the Carcase Classification Division of my Department have conducted 405 inspections across 32 factories.  There were 302 inspections in factories where mechanical classification is carried out and 103 inspections in the nine manual grading factories.  Over 36,000 carcasses were inspected.  The average number of inspections to date in 2020 per factory was 12 and the average number of carcasses inspected at each inspection was 88.  The legal requirement is eight inspections per year and a minimum of 40 carcasses at each inspection.  These inspection figures significantly exceed the numbers required under the relevant EU legislation. </p>  <p>  These unannounced checks by classification officers verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times.  When any mechanical system is found to be working outside of these tolerances, the meat plants concerned are instructed to revert to manual grading.  Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied. </p>  <p>  The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by DAFM occurred on four occasions to date in 2020 and the factories in questions were instructed to revert to manual grading.  In all instances, classification officers from my Department conducted a classification check before a factory was allowed to recommence mechanical grading.  </p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1184 of 20 April 2017 sets out the legal tolerances for authorisation of a mechanical classification system. The figure quoted of 60% is the minimum accuracy figure for conformation and fat cover that must be achieved for a mechanical classification system to be authorised for use in any EU state. The average performance for conformation in Ireland in 2019 was 93.3% and 95.1% for fat cover.   To date in 2020, average performance for conformation is 93.3% and 95.6% for fat cover.</p>  <p>  The role of my Department is clearly defined in the Irish legislation (SI 249/2019) in terms of monitoring and supervision of classification, weights and carcase presentation. This legislation does not provide for any appeal mechanism by the competent authority in relation to the classification of carcasses by mechanical methods.</p>  <p>  During these 405 inspections, classification officers  also monitored compliance with the EU reference carcase presentation specification.  Monitoring of carcase presentation continues to be carried out by my Department's Veterinary Public Health staff based in the factories, on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  To date in 2020, one factory has been fined for non-compliance with carcase presentation, details of which will be published on the Department website in due course.  Any payments made to a Farmer Supplier, including in relation to issues such as this, are a matter between the Farmer/Supplier and the Processor/plant.</p></reply>
