These arrangements were communicated as forming part of a &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; of post-COVID CSO Office attendance, pending finalisation of the civil service Blended Working Framework, published on March 31st 2022, which provided the basis for the development of the CSO&rsquo;s own recently finalised Blended Working Policy. </p>  <p>  On the basis of extenuating circumstances, a limited number of alternative &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; attendance arrangements were agreed reflecting specific personal-to-holder considerations, decided on a case-by-case basis.  As with other &ldquo;transition phase&rdquo; arrangements, the latter were clearly identified as being in place pending implementation of the CSO Blended Working Policy. </p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s Blended Working Policy attendance model combines time spent working from a designated Home workstation with time spent working on-site from an assigned CSO premises and access to this flexibility is contingent on satisfying a combination of eligibility criteria comprising an assessment of role suitability, person suitability and ergonomic assessment of the available home workspace. </p>  <p>  The CSO physical offices will continue to be the primary workplace for all employees as designated during the point of hire, which is consistent with the Civil Service wide policy. Where role, person and ergonomic suitability assessments are deemed satisfactory, the Policy provides that CSO staff may apply to work from a designated home workspace up to a maximum of 60% of weekly rostered hours. This equates to up to three full days in a standard working week for FTEs (pro-rata for work sharers). Final determination of the appropriate level of on-site versus homeworking within the parameters provided for in the Policy rests with section/team or Divisional Managers and such decisions are taken having regard to meeting the needs of the business.</p>  <p>CSO Staff will be given the opportunity to submit their application for Blended Working from mid-September 2022. The Policy will come into effect from November 1st 2022 and all prior attendance arrangements will then lapse. Any staff member not having applied for or not having been approved on application for Blended Working will thereafter be required to attend at the employer&rsquo;s premises on a whole-time basis by default, where this is consistent with their contract of employment. </p>  <p>  Blended Working, where made available, is a flexible benefit not an entitlement or a right and is subject to oversight, review and withdrawal at the discretion of line managers having regard to defined eligibility provisions and based on the needs of the business. </p>  <p>  CSO HR and Line Managers have been engaging with staff in preparation for the opening of the application process (mid-September 2022). Any staff member with a specific query regarding Blended Working should speak to their line manager in the first instance, and then HR. During the last few months CSO HR have engaged with a number of staff, including the member of staff referred to in this PQ, in relation to concerns regarding Blended Working and has provided advice and guidance to inform staff of options open to them and to support decision making. CSO HR continues to be available to support staff as the Civil Service moves to a Blended Working model. </p></reply>

This will be central to our budget discussions and any new measures to assist businesses will be announced on Budget Day. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working with officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and Environment, Climate and Communications and other relevant Departments to develop proposals to assist all business. A priority is to deliver that assistance as effectively and efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government has already implemented measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of rising energy costs, including a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged, by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil.</p>  <p>  There are over 20 other government grants, vouchers and training available to help enterprises reduce their energy bills by reducing their use and becoming more energy efficient. Details of these are available on gov.ie. But we need to do more. We need a mix of broad based measures that will help all business and we also need targeted interventions for those most impacted.</p>  <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and his Department are involved in the EU negotiations on energy and we are expecting to see a full set of measures to support enterprise. My Department is also working with the European Commission to allow us to grant state aid to certain businesses to help them with additional costs (both liquidity and energy costs) due to the Russian war on Ukraine.</p></reply>

The Agreement will cement the close political and economic relations between the EU and Mercosur countries and represents a clear commitment from both regions to rules-based international trade.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Ireland exported nearly &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region. In 2020 &ndash; the most recent year for which figures are available &ndash; Ireland exported approximately &euro;1 billion worth of services to Mercosur. Further expansion into the Mercosur markets is expected as a result of the Agreement reached. The independent impact assessment commissioned by my Department, and published in 2021, concluded that Irish exports to the Mercosur market are expected to be 17% higher in 2035 under the terms of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  However, we also have some well-known concerns regarding climate change and the environmental impact of the extensive forest fire we have seen in the Amazon. I have raised these concerns at all political levels, including through my engagement with the Commission and with Trade Minister colleagues in Council. </p>  <p>  It is on the basis of these concerns, raised by Ireland and other Member States, that the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) are engaged with the Mercosur countries on negotiating further enforceable commitments on climate and deforestation. Enforceable commitments on matters relating to trade and sustainable development, including environmental and deforestation protections, must be added to the Agreement and we support the work of the Commission and particularly Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis in negotiating additional text. </p>  <p>  When the final text is presented to Member States, including the additional commitment sought from Mercosur, our position will depend on our assessment of these additional climate and environmental enforcement provisions, as well as the findings of the Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment, which was commissioned in line with the Government&rsquo;s stated commitments as part of the formation of Government in 2020 and published in July 2021.</p></reply>

As a small open economy, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this. In that context, I believe that ratifying the agreement would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.</p>  <p>  The Agreement has provisionally applied since 21st September 2017, meaning a great many of the benefits are already in place. Since provisional application, duties on 98% of products that the EU trades with Canada have been removed and goods exports to Canada have increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 36%, while services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 38 per cent. These figures demonstrate the positive impact of CETA.</p>  <p>  At the Joint Oireachtas Committee last year, I highlighted the benefits of CETA. I also said that, while I welcome the scrutiny at Committee, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other EU member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority have. That would send out the wrong message to the world. The number of EU Member States to ratify the Agreement rose from 15 to 16 in July this year when the Dutch Senate voted in favour of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The ratification process for CETA in Ireland has also been subject to legal challenges. In March last year, Deputy Patrick Costello commenced High Court proceedings on the basis of his view that CETA requires a referendum in order to be ratified in Ireland. The Government very much welcomed the Judgement in those High Court proceedings that issued last September. Deputy Costello has subsequently appealed the High Court&rsquo;s decision to the Supreme Court and judgement is currently awaited. Separately, Senator Lynn Boylan has initiated a High Court action on ratification but a hearing date has not yet been set in this matter.</p>  <p>  It remains the position that Government will consider the next steps in Ireland&rsquo;s ratification process once the Supreme Court has delivered its judgement.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s primary functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services. </p>  <p>  I understand that Section 2(1) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, incorporating Section 14 (Sunday entitlement), does not apply to those engaged in sea fishing. Notwithstanding, it is open to a fishing vessel owner to include a Sunday entitlement in employment contracts. In such circumstances where an Owner then fails to give this entitlement there may be scope to present a complaint to an Adjudication Officer of the WRC under Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) was established as a cross Departmental response to address the matter of non-EEA workers on certain categories of vessels in the Irish fishing fleet. The scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet and was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA fishers availing of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Review of the AWS for Sea Fishers is a cross Departmental review with representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Justice and my Department. The cross-departmental group&rsquo;s report remains under active consideration by the relevant Departments, with a view to bringing recommendations to Government in the near future. In the meantime, the Oversight Committee, chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine continues to oversee the scheme as currently structured.</p></reply>

Growth outside of Dublin was particularly buoyant with 53%, that is 133 projects of the 249 investments won going to regional locations and employment growth was recorded in every region of the country.</p><p>Galway and Roscommon are marketed by the IDA as the West Region. There are 120 IDA supported companies in this Region, employing 29,419 people. There are 94 IDA supported companies in Galway city and county, employing 22,801 and 10 in County Roscommon employing 1,473 in total. The FDI performance in this Region has been strong over the past five years. There is a significant ecosystem of well-established Life Sciences companies, which has helped drive strong cluster development. The number of people employed in software engineering, technical support, global business services and R&amp;amp;D in the Region has also grown considerably in recent years.</p><p>Athlone is in the IDA Midlands Region, where there are 49 IDA client companies, employing 6,868 people. The FDI performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years.  The region has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies. The existing FDI base of client companies in the region continues to perform well in terms of their operational sustainability, job retention and ongoing transformation.</p><p>IDA Ireland continues to engage with new companies on promoting Ireland as a location for their business utilising virtual site visits as well as physically visiting the county. As a result of the severe restrictions on international travel over the last two years, the ability to host site visits was severely limited.  IDA Ireland has developed an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors. As with in-person visits, a number of locations can be marketed within an E-Site Visit. </p><p>Site visit details are recorded on a county basis.

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.    In line with the Scheme guidelines and technical guidance, the Warmer Homes Scheme does not support insulation works on homes older than 1940, traditional or older buildings, specifically stone, random rubble and single-leaf brick walls. </p>  <p>  Older stone-build buildings (generally those built up until around the 1940s) usually fall into the category of traditionally built buildings.  Such stone-built structures were designed to be vapour permeable. It is important that the materials and techniques used in energy efficiency upgrades of such buildings are suitable for the buildings in question including for use with vapor permeable construction where applicable. For example, a stone wall with lime-based mortar will need a lime-based plaster render to remain vapour permeable.  Otherwise vapour becomes trapped leading to problems which can cause harm to the building and its occupants.  </p>  <p>  SEAI support the insulation of buildings using materials and products which are appropriate and have been determined fit for use in the Irish climate by National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI). SEAI has no role in the certification of products used in Ireland but is aware that very old homes which are constructed using stone and lime-based mortar are more complicated to insulate for the reasons outlined above.   </p>  <p>  To support the proper upgrade of traditional buildings a new technical Guidance Document - &ldquo;Energy Efficiency in Traditional Buildings&rdquo; is being developed led by the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage. My Department and the SEAI are participating in the steering group overseeing the project.  The objective is to finalise the guidance having regard to submissions received in the pubic consultation with a view to publishing it this year.  Once available this guidance will be an important resource to support contractors in the appropriate energy efficiency upgrade and renovation of older stone-build buildings while ensuring compliance with the appropriate building regulations. </p></reply>

Construction is underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with or exceeding projections. NBI has advised that over 1250 premises in County Kildare are passed with a high-speed fibre broadband network and available for immediate connection.  </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed and connected to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project.

Gas and electricity retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. However, I am acutely aware of the impact that current, internationally influenced, energy price increases are having on people and families and, for that reason, Government has put in place a series of measures with funding of &euro;2.4 billion to help alleviate the impact, particularly on lower income households. Further measures are being considered in the context of Budget 2023.  </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Climate Action Plan 2021, a District Heating Steering Group was established earlier this year. The Steering Group has met seven times so far and oversees a number of Working Groups that are conducting in-depth, solutions-based analysis of the key areas that must be addressed in order to support district heating. The Steering Group is working on recommendations to ensure that a robust governance and regulatory framework is put in place to support expansion of district heating, along with any legislation that may be required. This will help ensure consumer protection and considerations in this regard encompass legacy district heating schemes that are already in operation in Ireland. The Steering Group is expected to bring its report to Government later this year.</p></reply>

This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the achievement of these targets will require a step-change in the pace and scale of delivery in Ireland&rsquo;s residential retrofit programme, earlier this year, the Government approved a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. The key measures included: </p>  <p>-   A new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard (up from 30%-35% grants currently).</p>  <p>-   Establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a new, start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing, for home energy upgrades.</p>  <p>-   Increases in grant levels for certain measures under the Better Energy Home scheme and Community Energy Grant scheme in line with those in the new Scheme.</p>  <p>  -A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households, to urgently reduce energy use as part of the government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p>  <p>  These changes have resulted in a very high level of demand with over 32,000 applications received to date versus a total of 20,000 applications for the full year 2021. This high level of demand has also translated into strong delivery with SEAI data showing that 13,406 upgrades have been completed across the residential and community energy schemes to end-August. The full year output under the schemes last year was approximately 15,500 home upgrades.  </p>  <p>  The grant rates were set following a comprehensive evaluation and consultative process led by SEAI and the Department, including leveraging learning and experience in SEAI, industry consultation, customer research and analysis of cost data. SEAI will monitor cost data on an ongoing basis to track and monitor changes in the market. The grant rates will be kept under review taking account of: the overarching need to build a much bigger home upgrade sector; evolving science; innovation; evolving technology and other relevant factors. </p>  <p>  The SEAI has also worked to streamline and improve the application process for grants. Online applications for cavity wall and attic insulation under the Better Energy Homes Scheme receive immediate confirmation of the grant offer.</p></reply>

These schemes include the grid scale, auction based Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and the Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS), for installations up to 50 kW in size (30kWe for micro-renewable Combined Heat and Power).    The RESS and MSS schemes both include anaerobic digestion (AD) for electricity generation under the category 'Biogas with High Efficiency Combined Heat and Power' as an eligible technology . However, no AD projects have come through the RESS auctions to date. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators (SSG) above 50kW, i.e. larger than MSS  but smaller than RESS scale. This is expected to come into effect in 2023. My Department launched a public consultation on proposed elements of the SSG scheme which is open until the 29th September: https://www.gov.ie/en/consultation/353f2-consultation-on-a-small-scale-generation-support-scheme-ssg-in-ireland/.   </p>  <p>  The range of renewables to be supported under the SSG will be determined in the design phase, after taking on board views in the public consultation. </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has 6.3% of its heat sector demand met by renewable energy. While progress is being made, significant action is needed to reduce emissions and increase the supply of renewable fuels across the heat sector. Anaerobic digestion for renewable heat is supported through the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH). The SSRH is a Government funded initiative designed to increase the energy generated from renewable sources in the heat sector whilst also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The scheme is open to commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating, public sector and other non-domestic heat users and is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The SSRH provides an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems and an installation grant for renewable heating systems using heat pumps.</p>  <p>  In line with the recent agreement on Sectoral Emissions Ceilings to deliver up to 5.7 TWh of biomethane to further accelerate the reduction of overall economy-wide emissions, an obligation on the heat sector to include renewable heat will be introduced by 2024. The introduction of this Obligation will incentivise the use of renewable heat, while spreading the obligation across all non-renewable fuel types. </p></reply>

The schemes offer grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy upgrades for people at risk of energy poverty. Improving these homes has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.  </p>  <p>  Near Zero Energy Building requirements for new dwellings were introduced into the Building Regulations in April 2019 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from fossil fuels for heating. There are options for meeting compliance including heat pumps and/or solar PV.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations have been progressively updated over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings. Many of the techniques required to achieve NZEB, such as improved fabric and renewables, have been introduced on a gradual basis into Part L of the Building Regulations since 2007. These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimised the additional effort and costs required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.</p>  <p>  A modelling and cost study was carried out by an external cost economic consultant for the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for NZEB. The average uplift in cost across all dwelling types modelled was 1.9%.</p>  <p>  Grant funding to improve energy performance is available for existing homes because these homes were not required to meet the most up to date NZEB Building Regulations. It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. Grants are not targeted at meeting compliance requirements when building a new home.  </p>  <p>  Full detail of the grants and grant amounts are available on SEAI&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The battery in EVs is of a higher capacity than a typical domestic battery storage solution for micro-generation. In the future, it may be possible for EV batteries to be used to store excess micro-generated electricity during the day and provide electricity after daylight, and this could represent a better investment for the householder.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that micro-generation installations including battery storage systems are still eligible for grant support but there is now no need to install a battery to avail of the maximum grant and, with the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG), any residual renewable electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment. </p>  <p>  Further to the CEG I am aware that most suppliers have now published their CEG tariffs, which range from &euro;13.5c/kWh up to &euro;20c/kWh. While maximising the consumption of self-generated renewable electricity by matching electricity use against the peak generating times of your Solar PV system will provide the most benefit to offset rising electricity costs; the range of CEG tariffs allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best overall value.</p></reply>

As part of the achievement of this reduction, the CAP set ambitious targets to install 600,000 heat pumps in homes by 2030, of which 400,000 will be in existing homes.  The Government recently announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offers increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with heat pump. Homes that take a step-by-step approach can avail of grants of up to &euro;6,500 for the replacement of fossil fuelled boilers with heat pumps. Full details on the range of SEAI supports available can be found at www.seai.ie.</p>  <p>  The National Energy Security Framework (NESF), outlines that a National Policy Statement on Heat will be developed this year, based on the outcomes of the National Heat Study, including a key focus on the decarbonisation of our building stock and the development of district heating. The National Heat Study highlights that the Government must decide when the appropriate time to phase out new fossil fuel boilers in homes is. The NESF under Response 17, sets out a commitment to develop proposals for regulatory and policy options to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel heating throughout our building stock. This will allow all sectors of the economy adequate time to plan this phase-out, and to give the heat pump industry retrofit sector adequate time to scale up capacity. This work is underway and is being led by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to ban replacement boilers in the short term and is aware that this will need to be done in a manner that protects the most vulnerable in society. Fossil fuel heating is the most expensive form of heating which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. CAP21 has signalled that the Government will publish a high level phase-out plan in the next Climate Action Plan. A consultation is currently open on the plan and a further public consultation will be completed on any specific heat policy.</p></reply>

This included a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard and establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing, for home energy upgrades.  Under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, the One Stop Shops will provide a seamless and integrated service for homeowners with no visible handovers of customer communication or relationships within the home energy upgrade project.</p>  <p>  Following Government approval, the SEAI registration portal opened for companies to apply to be a One-Stop-Shop, building on the preparatory work already undertaken. SEAI are focused on engaging organisations capable of professionally managing all aspects of a One Stop Shop service. Therefore, the registration process, for this new service, is necessarily robust.</p>  <p>There are 11 One-Stop-Shops registered with the SEAI and a 12th is expected to be announced shortly. In addition, SEAI continues to actively work with other applicant organisations to support them through this registration process and it is expected that up to 20 One Stop Shops will be in place by the end of this year. Details of all the One-Stop-Shops can be accessed at: www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/registered-providers/.</p>  <p>  Figures for the end of August show 962 applications have been submitted to the SEAI for Home Energy Assessments and 556 Applications for Home Energy Upgrade works.  The high demand for the scheme means there is a strong pipeline of works for the rest of this year and into 2023.</p>  <p>  Overall demand across all of the SEAI retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high to date this year. Figures for the end of August show over 30,400 applications have been received to SEAI which is a significant increase on 2021 volumes. To the end of August, 13,406 home energy upgrades have been completed across the SEAI residential and community schemes. This marks an increase of almost 70% on the same period in 2021.</p>  <p>  Latest SEAI projections indicate that approximately 26,000 home energy upgrades will be delivered this year.</p></reply>

Maintaining security of supply while integrating greater levels of renewable generation will require a very high penetration of variable electricity on the Irish grid, with increased storage capacity providing a low-carbon substitute for high greenhouse gas emitting power generation fuels, such as peat and coal. EirGrid has reported that a number of battery projects have been contracted via two mechanisms: SEM Capacity Auctions and DS3 Systems Services. There is currently approximately 500MW of short-duration batteries on the all-island system providing system services, as well as 292MW of pumped hydro storage.  The Commission of Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which has statutory responsibility to ensure security of supply, has the duty to monitor electricity supplies and to take sure measures as it considers necessary to protect the security of supply. The CRU, assisted by Eirgrid and my Department has a programme of actions underway to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters. The Security of Supply Programme of actions contains a number of both demand and supply side mitigation measures to address the forecasted shortfall.</p></reply>

As a result, the contribution of offshore wind is currently relatively small and is reported together with the onshore wind figures.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland reports annually on total electricity generated and electricity generated by wind in its Energy in Ireland publication, the latest edition available here: www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-publications/energy-in-ireland/.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Ireland report is updated on an annual basis and published in the last quarter of the year. The report is published one year in arrears, therefore official figures for 2021 will be available in the report to be published in December of this year.</p>  <p>  In 2020, wind generation accounted for 36.1% of all electricity generated in Ireland.  Provisional estimates provided to my Department by EirGrid indicate that approximately 31GWh of electricity was generated in Ireland in 2021, of which approximately 35% was generated from renewable sources.  The majority of renewable electricity was generated from wind, which provided approximately 31% of total electricity generated.</p></reply>

In 2022, my Department will continue to drive the delivery of renewable energy sources in line with our targets and identified actions.The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is Ireland&rsquo;s flagship policy to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s target of up to 80% renewable electricity by the end of the decade. The RESS is an auction-based support scheme which invites grid-scale renewable electricity generation projects to compete to receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate.</p><p>Supported technologies include onshore wind, solar and hybrids (co-located wind, solar, storage), as well as offshore wind projects through dedicated offshore auctions.  It will also allow Ireland to take advantage of new technologies as they emerge.</p><p>Over 1GW of new wind and solar generation are being developed under the first onshore RESS auction in 2020, RESS 1. The first RESS 1 projects have now reached commercial operation with further projects to reach commercial operation throughout 2022, with the remainder expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023 at latest.</p><p>The second onshore RESS auction has secured a further estimated 1.5GW of renewable generation to deliver by the end of 2025.  A roadmap of future auctions which sets out the indicative timelines and volumes for onshore and offshore auctions over the coming decade, was published in December 2021.</p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 also commits to achieving at least 5GW of offshore wind by 2030.  The Government has recently agreed to increase our ambition in offshore wind energy, moving from 5GW to 7GW, with the additional 2GW earmarked for the supply of green hydrogen, a strategy for which is under development.</p><p>The Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) will be established in early 2023.  In the interim, the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 provides the legal authority for the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications to assess Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of pre-qualified offshore renewable energy projects. A significant milestone was reached this year, with the receipt of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from this first phase of offshore renewable energy projects. Decisions on the first MACs will be issued this year, allowing successful projects to apply for planning permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la. This will mark an important step towards reaching our 2030 climate targets.</p><p>My Department recently held a consultation on the criteria for the second batch of offshore projects required to meet our offshore energy targets, with a decision on these criteria to be taken later this year.</p></reply>

The MSS is targeting support for 380MW of installed micro-generation capacity, to contribute to the revised target of up to 5.5GW of solar renewables under the Climate Action Plan and the recent Government agreement on sectoral emissions ceilings.  Micro-generation has an important role to play as it creates opportunities for domestic, school, farming and small commercial customers to take the first steps towards investment in renewable technologies, by generating and consuming their own electricity, which can play a role in shaping electricity demand and decarbonising homes and businesses.</p><p>The MSS will provide capital grants for non-domestic applicants, such as schools, for solar PV installations up to 6.0kW primarily for self-consumption, with grant levels up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 available. This will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and will become available to the non-domestic sector for installations up to 6.0kW by the end of September.  In addition, the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff is now available from most electricity suppliers, offering the opportunity for new and existing micro-and small-scale generators, including schools, to receive payment for excess renewable electricity that they may export to the grid.</p><p>The SEAI in partnership with the Department of Education, are also working on the Pathfinder programme to improve energy performance of schools and are trialing retrofit and renewable heat solutions.

The security of supply programme of actions contains a number of both demand-side and supply-side mitigation measures to address the forecasted shortfall. These actions include: procurement of new, enduring capacity through a number of capacity auctions; procuring additional temporary generation; extending the availability of existing generation capacity; additional use of grid scale batteries; and improved demand-side measures.  Margins will remain tight during this coming winter period (2022/2023). The CRU is continuing to work with key stakeholders to implement additional appropriate mitigation measures to further reduce risks during this winter and lower peak demand during this period.</p>  <p>  In line with the Governments policy statement on security of electricity supply published in November 2021 it is appropriate that existing conventional electricity generation capacity, including existing coal, should be retained until the new conventional electricity generation capacity is developed in order to ensure security of electricity supply.</p>  <p>  Conventional capacity will only operate if and when needed, with renewable energy and efficient gas-fired power stations always being supplied to the market first. This approach will minimise the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, while ensuring continued security of electricity supply.</p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload.  Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of these State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p>  <p>  A representative of the nursing home referred to in this question has been engaging with my Department's NBP Customer Service team on this issue and the matter is currently under examination.

Shannon Heritage ended their management contracts with An Post and Fingal County Council for sites in Dublin on 31 December 2021 and the transfer of the business and employees took place without issue.  King John&rsquo;s Castle was successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April.

As part of its engagement with Shannon Airport Group, Clare County Council identified a funding gap for which it sought government assistance to enable it to take over the sites. In response to this, in May of this year, my Department established an inter-departmental working group to consider the funding options. The group included the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the OPW, and the Department of Tourism Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.</p><p>To date, the working group has met three times, and identified a number of ways to support a transfer.  My Department has also met with Clare County Council and Shannon Airport Group and has asked both to continue their engagement and consider the package of measures identified by the inter-departmental working group, with a view to reaching agreement on a transfer.</p><p>Once the remaining issues around the transfer are resolved, Shannon Airport Group will be in a position to seek the formal consent of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to execute the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and the relevant heritage sites and this will be done with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that Government recognises the importance of these heritage sites to the mid-west region, and that this Government will continue to support Shannon Airport Group to ensure that the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and heritage sites will proceed as planned with a view to ensuring the long-term viability and success of the business.</p></reply>

On 1st July 2022, my Department introduced a pilot blended working scheme that facilitates flexible blended working arrangements for all eligible staff members on a pattern of up to a maximum of 5 days over a fortnight period on a 2 days / 3 days alternating pattern for office attendance as determined by business needs, with flexibility expected from staff on other days where there are particular business requirements.  Pro-rata arrangements are in place for work-sharing staff members. </p><p>Due to the nature of work undertaken by my Department, there are some roles  which are not amenable to blended working arrangements, such as the Watch Officer role in the Irish Coast Guard. </p><p>To date, no staff members in eligible roles have been declined flexible working arrangements during our phased transition back to the office from October 2021 or blended working arrangements during this pilot period which began on 1<sup>st</sup>July 2022.  Following this pilot period an evaluation of the effectiveness of the arrangements across a range of criteria will inform future developments.</p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years with over 64,700 EVs registered in the State at the end of July.</p><p>In addition, the Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. In particular, the group examined the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online.</p><p>In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs:  </p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports has been retained until at least end-2022. </p><p>- Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) was launched in July, a new office to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  </p><p>A cross-departmental Implementation Committee has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the EVPP report and is due to report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.</p><p>The Government provides up to &euro;5,000 towards purchase of new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and a grant eligibility price cap of &euro;60,000 applies. The price cap was introduced to direct funding away from the luxury car market and towards lowered priced vehicles. There are no plans to remove this cap at present. However as part of the ZEVI launch in July, I announced that an expansion of the current electric vans grant is in development which will include large panel vans. Large panel vans with a price of &euro;90,000 or less will be eligible for this grant. </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review in an effort to make low-emission vehicles affordable.</p></reply>

I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p>  <p>  Due to suspension of driver testing services in the first 2020 lockdown, along with health protocols since resumption and further curtailing of services during subsequent restrictions, a significant backlog developed. </p>  <p>  Since public health restrictions have eased, considerable progress has been made in addressing these backlogs, with waiting times having reduced significantly.</p>  <p>  Pre-Covid, the target national average wait for a test was 10 weeks.

The Regulation applies to driver documents held by Ukrainians admitted to the EU under the Temporary Protection Directive and for the period of temporary protection only.</p>  <p>  A person with C or D categories on their licence (trucks and buses) must have a driver certificate of professional competence (CPC) to drive a truck or bus professionally in Ireland. The EU Regulation allows for the recognition of Ukrainian CPCs, subject to the holder undergoing additional compulsory training. The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is in the process of developing this programme of additional compulsory training. Legislative and system changes will be required, along with liaison with stakeholders such as driving instructors and CPC training providers. The RSA and my department are working to have these processes in place as soon as possible. The RSA website will be updated with details of the training required once all arrangements are finalised. </p>  <p>  The RSA is continuing the evaluation of the driving licence regimes in Argentina and North Macedonia, with a view to considering a driving licence exchange with these countries.

I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days</p>  <p>  On the generality of the Deputy's question, I note that it is a criminal offence to provide false, misleading or deceptive information regarding a vehicle to a customer under the Consumer Protection Act 2007. Automotive traders are obliged to disclose a vehicle&rsquo;s entire history to the customer, including information about whether a vehicle was previously written off. </p>  <p>  With respect to periodic roadworthiness testing, I would remind the Deputy that the NCT is not an enforcement tool against unscrupulous vehicle modifications. It is a check at a point in time that a vehicle meets a basic standard. During the test, the vehicle cannot be dismantled, so only parts that are accessible can be checked. The NCT is not a substitute for a comprehensive technical examination of a vehicle prior to purchase and therefore should not be regarded as a warranty. It is essential that car buyers carry out thorough background checks, using reputable vehicle history checking websites, and gather as much information as possible before buying a vehicle. </p>  <p>  I am aware of reports of written-off vehicles being placed on the market, albeit in relatively small numbers. The proposed Road Traffic and Roads Bill will put in place the necessary legislative provisions needed to establish a database of all motor insurance policies, which may incorporate written-off vehicles.</p></reply>

This new set of regulations consists of regulations S.I. No. 672/2019 - European Union (International Labour Organisation Work in Fishing Convention) (Working Hours) Regulations 2019 which are for Irish fishing vessels where at least one fisher on-board is engaged in a contract of employment. There is an additional set of regulations for share fishers S.I. No. 585/2020 - European Union (Workers on Board Seagoing Fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) (Share Fishermen) Regulations 2020 and these apply hours of work and rest requirements to fishers working on Irish fishing vessels where all fishers are share fishers. The final set of regulations is S.I. No. 441/2020 - European Union (Workers on Board Seagoing Fishing Vessels) (Organisation of Working Time) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 which applies the hours of work and rest to fishing vessels flying the flag of another member state when in a port in the state.</p>  <p>  The Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department carries out survey and inspections of fishing vessels for compliance with safety, environment and fisher living and working conditions. The Irish fleets consists of approximately 2000 fishing vessels and some 6,500 fishers. All fishing vessels are subject to a survey and certification regime managed by the MSO. All vessels are subject to a survey every four years and issued with a certificate if found compliant with the requirements. The surveys cover all aspects including crew qualifications, living and working arrangements including hours of work and rest. The MSO carries out its role for all Irish vessels in Ireland and anywhere in the world as well as for all persons on-board irrespective of their nationality, employment status or immigration status. Furthermore, the MSO carries out inspection of foreign flagged fishing vessels when in Irish ports.</p>  <p>  The MSO adopts a graduated approach to the rectification of such anomalies and initially seeks that the owner or skipper brings the vessel into compliance. Further action could be to detain the vessel until the issue has been rectified. In a limited number of cases the MSO may initiate a prosecution. The enforcement of the MSO requirements is effective as the licence to fish which is issued by the Sea Fish Licensing Administration of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is based on the vessel complying with the relevant safety regime that is in place for each sector. On this basis the MSO carries out or oversees 500 such surveys and inspections each year and since 2017 has initiated 11 prosecutions where hours of work and rest was amongst a number of issues.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 945,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required. </p><p>The department established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 175,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. The full report is available online. Electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review with a view to making low-emission vehicles affordable.</p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles.

An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. IREFs are required to deduct a 20% withholding tax (&ldquo;IREF WHT&rdquo;) on distributions to non-resident investors. The non-resident investors may also be subject to tax under the rules of their home jurisdiction. Certain categories of non-resident investors, such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings, are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Irish resident investors are generally subject to a separate investment undertaking tax, at a rate of 41% for individuals and 25% for companies, on income / gains from the fund.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been a reduction in WHT paid by IREFs in 2021 (in respect of taxable events that occurred in accounting periods ended in 2020), relative to the amount paid in the preceding year, and my officials have requested that Revenue undertake a review to identify the reason(s) for this change.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the initial focus of the review is a detailed analysis of the information contained in the 2021 IREF Financial Statements, IREF Withholding Tax Returns and Form 1 (IREFs) Income Tax Returns. The review encompasses the consideration of various risk factors and a key focus is the identification of cases for compliance interventions to ensure perceived risks are properly and robustly addressed. The analysis involves detailed examination of tax returns and financial statements for a number of years and will include a review of the transactions undertaken by IREFs, and of distributions made, to ascertain if the distributions have been treated in accordance with the legislative provisions. Where this work identifies possible non-compliance with the relevant legislation, Revenue will undertake appropriate compliance interventions. Should any deficiencies in the legislative provisions for IREFs be identified by this review, this will be brought to the attention of my Department.</p>  <p>  As respects the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion of applying corporation tax to the profits made by IREFs, any such proposal can only be examined once the full facts and circumstances of any issues with the existing regime have been identified and analysed.</p></reply>

Section 865(4) TCA provides that that right is subject to the making of a claim within a statutory limit of four years after the end of the chargeable period to which the claim relates.  That statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on taxpayers.  Determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances confirm that there is no discretion in the application of the four-year rule for claiming repayments.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of this provision there was no statutory right to repayment of tax, though a taxpayer could make a claim for repayment, or could sue for repayment under common law.  </p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns is also subject to a four-year limit in most cases.  However, as the Deputy states, in certain circumstances - for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules - Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited. Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years.  </p>  <p>  The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.  An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.  </p>  <p>  When the four-year time limits were introduced in 2003 the then Minister for Finance stated he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer. I am satisfied that continues to be the position.  I also believe it is appropriate that Revenue should be able to impose interest for late payment and penalties for filing inaccurate returns in cases where a return has been found to be deficient. This is an important dimension of supporting voluntary timely compliance and in ensuring an effective and proportionate response in the context of fraud or neglect or tax avoidance.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend the four-year limit in section 865 TCA or to change Revenue&rsquo;s right to raise assessments or make enquiries outside the four-year period, where appropriate.</p></reply>

As such, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to provide an estimated cost to the Exchequer for increasing the tax-free payment from &euro;3.20 to &euro;5 per day. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that any amounts paid exceeding the &euro;3.20 daily rate are subject to tax, PRSI and USC in the normal manner. </p>  <p>  If the employer does not make a payment of &euro;3.20 per day, (or pays less than &euro;3,20 per day) Remote Working Relief can be claimed, deducting any payment made by the employer.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, in the Finance Act 2021, I enhanced and formalised the tax arrangements for working from home in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.

The onus is on a landlord to ascertain whether s/he is excluded from the requirement to register tenancies. The excluded types of dwelling are listed under section 3 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 Act and include:</p><p>- business premises; </p><p>- former rent-controlled dwellings occupied by the original tenant or by her or his spouse; </p><p>- a dwelling occupied under a shared ownership lease; </p><p>- a tenancy where the landlord and tenant share the same self-contained unit; </p><p>- a dwelling in which the spouse, parent or child of the landlord is resident and where there is no written lease or tenancy agreement; holiday lettings; or </p><p>- a dwelling let by, or to, a public authorities.</p><p>Landlords are required to register details of all<b></b>their tenancies within one month of the commencement of those tenancies. Revenue have advised that if all the tenancies in a dwelling are not registered for a particular year, all interest relief in respect of that dwelling will be lost for the year. There is no provision for apportionment where only some of the tenancies are registered.</p><p>An interest deduction is claimed under the normal self-assessment system. A landlord is required to state in the annual return of income that s/he has complied with the registration requirements. I am advised that Revenue regards the registration requirements for a chargeable period as met if they are met by the return filing date for that period. Revenue does not require that evidence of registration is submitted with the return of income, but such evidence should be retained for inspection in the event of a compliance intervention by Revenue.</p><p>In accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 as amended, I am advised that the RTB supplies Revenue with an annual extract of tenancy information held by the RTB. The data provides details of all tenancies with a commencement date beginning on or subsequent to 1 January 2016. </p><p>I am further advised that if a landlord&rsquo;s tax return is selected for a Revenue compliance intervention, written confirmation of the registration of a tenancy from the RTB will be accepted as evidence of compliance with the registration requirements for that tenancy. In the case of an exempt dwelling, the onus will be on the landlord to show that s/he is not required to comply with the registration requirements. If a landlord has failed to comply with the registration requirements for a chargeable period, any interest relief that has been claimed will be withdrawn. Such a withdrawal of interest relief may result in an underpayment of tax and expose the landlord to interest and penalties.</p><p>While new tenancies should be registered within one month of their commencement, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 Act provides for late registration at double the normal registration fee. I am advised that Revenue will accept an acknowledgement from the RTB confirming a late registration as evidence of compliance with the registration requirements provided for in Part 7 of the 2004 Act.  However, a person claiming an interest deduction on their annual tax return must be able to indicate compliance with the Part 7 requirements at the time of making the return. I am also advised that if interest relief has been denied for a chargeable period because a tenancy was not registered by the return filing date, the relief can subsequently be restored if the landlord avails of the late registration facility, subject to the usual four-year time limit on claims for repayment of tax.</p><p>Revenue has a legal duty to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer information and is obliged to treat personal and business information of all taxpayers in the strictest of confidence.  As such, it has advised that it would not be appropriate for it to comment further in response to the matters raised by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.</p><p>The key cause of the higher level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors including manufacturing. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months, to 6 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.</p><p>The Government knows the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has already taken significant action to help. Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. <i>Budget 2023</i>will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices.</p><p>However, we know that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of ongoing global economic uncertainty and macro-economic risk. Furthermore, in responding to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system. </p></reply>

In August, annual inflation stood at 8.9 per cent.  Rising price pressures are of course not unique to Ireland with most advanced economies experiencing similar price pressures. In the euro area inflation reached a record 9.1 per cent in August. </p><p>The pandemic initially had a deflationary impact on the economy. This was followed by an inflationary period as demand out-paced supply during the re-opening phase of many economies. However, the key driver of recent price spikes has been Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine and the knock-on impact it has had on the energy markets and broader commodities market. However, spillover effects from higher energy prices are also being felt in other sectors, such as food (via fertilisers and fuel costs) and consumer goods and services (via higher energy inputs). Indeed, the recent rise in non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation, which stood at 6&frac14; per cent in August, suggests that inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based. </p><p>Irish property price and rental inflation have remained at high levels, a trend fundamentally driven by a lack of supply. Resolving pressures in the housing market is a critical priority for Government and &lsquo;<i>Housing for All</i>&rsquo; outlines the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase affordability and home ownership. &lsquo;<i>Housing for All</i>&rsquo; has the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State with in excess of &euro;20bn in funding through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over a five-year period. In Budget 2022, a record &euro;4 billion was allocated towards housing.  </p><p>The Government knows the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses. That is why, to meet the cost of living challenges currently facing our economy, the government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures to date. Furthermore, <i>Budget 2023</i>will be a &ldquo;Cost of Living Budget&rdquo;, aimed at cushioning the inflationary blow to Irish households and firms, in particular the most vulnerable members of society. However, it must be stressed that resources are limited, and the public finances cannot bear the full costs of this inflationary cycle. </p><p>The prudent management of our public finances over the past few years has put the exchequer in a position to fund a substantive cost of living package in Budget 2023. However, we must remain prudent to ensure that our public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory. </p></reply>

Subject to meeting vehicle and adaptation conditions, electric vehicles can avail of DDS provisions. </p>  <p>  Under DDDPS provisions, the reliefs from VRT and VAT are generous in nature amounting to up to &euro;10,000, &euro;16,000 or &euro;22,000, depending on the level of adaption required for the vehicle. There is no differentiation between electric and other vehicles in terms of available VRT/VAT relief. </p>  <p>  Section 135C(3)(b) of the Finance Act 1992 separately provides that a Category A series production electric vehicle can avail of relief of up to &euro;5,000 on the VRT due.

It is based on a per litre rate of &euro;0.636 for petrol, &euro;0.535 for diesel and &euro;0.118 LPG in respect of the mineral oil taxes applying to these products. An annual maximum of 2,730 litres applies in respect of a driver or passenger, and 4,100 litres in respect of an organisation. </p>  <p>  However, as electricity supplied for household use is not subject to electricity tax, there is no provision under the DDS to cover a grant scheme for electricity used to recharge electric vehicles similar to that provided for petrol or diesel vehicles.  </p></reply>

It underpins a key Programme for Government commitment and it is notable that this coincides with Irish having become a full working language of the EU Institutions since January.</p><p>From submissions made to the Oireachtas Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community, the achievement of an ambitious 20% recruitment target of proficient Irish speakers by 2030 requires a cross-Government approach.This is against a backdrop whereby only 0.4% of posts are designated currently by civil service employers as being Irish-speaking posts.</p><p>The Act provides that within 6 months of the date of enactment, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media shall establish an Irish Languages Services Advisory Committee.  Accordingly, Minister Martin and Minister of State Chambers established this Committee in June of this year.  My Department is represented on this Committee at Principal Officer level and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is similarly represented at the Committee. The committee is chaired by the Director of Irish at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p><p>The functions of this Committee are set out in the Act and include the preparation of a National Plan, within two years of its establishment, to increase the provision of services through the medium of Irish as well periodic surveying of the number of Irish speakers employed by the public service.  </p><p>Some of the actions that my Department and PAS are already taking to increase the number of fluent Irish speakers in the civil service include:</p><p><b>-  Dedicated recruitment and promotion competitions targeted at Irish language speakers:</b>Since the summer of 2021, PAS has held general civil service competitions for individuals with fluency in Irish at Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Principal Officer level.The outturn of these competitions reflects that the number of fluent Irish speakers applying to join the civil service, or otherwise declaring a fluency in Irish, remains low. </p><p>I am advised by PAS that since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, a total of 44 candidates have been assigned to date from panels established from recruitment competitions - from Clerical Officer to Principal Officer level - where fluency in Irish was required for the post in question and for which proficiency in Irish was tested as part of the PAS assessment process.  </p><p>Additionally, to the end of June 2022 PAS has assigned 101 candidates from competitions to posts where Irish was not identified by the hiring employer as a prerequisite for the post in question and where the candidate declared as part of their application that they had fluency in Irish.  Their proficiency in Irish was not, however, tested as part of the PAS assessment process.</p><p>It is possible that some Departments or Government Officers may also have recruited fluent speakers directly under their local recruitment licence instead of PAS.</p><p><b>- Irish language training in the Civil Service: </b>Along with the recruitment of staff with sufficient Irish language skills, the provision of Irish language training for the Civil Service is of particular importance, in order to enhance the linguistic abilities of current civil servants. OneLearning, the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service, was set up in 2017 and is responsible for delivering common training to all Civil Service Bodies (CSBs). </p><p>Irish language training courses continue to be made available to all existing Civil Servants via OneLearning - the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>Since 2018, 1,454 civil servants have enrolled on an Irish language training course through OneLearning.  470 enrolments of these enrolments were in 2021 and 179 to date in 2022. </p><p>OneLearning signed a new contract for the provision of Irish language training in 2021 and is currently rolling out an expanded range of Irish Language training courses that will include the introduction of a Beginner&rsquo;s Irish course, the first term of these courses will commence in September 2022.  The Irish Language courses will be certified by Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge (TEG), which is administered by the Centre for Irish Language at Maynooth University. It is a comprehensive, graded system that allows learners to undertake examinations at five different levels of proficiency. The various levels in TEG are broadly based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching and Assessment (Council of Europe, 2001). </p></reply>

Some of this marketing expenditure goes on advertising. Base marketing expenditure must be funded entirely by the Operator; and</p><p>B.  <b>Incremental Marketing:</b></p><p>&ldquo;Incremental marketing&rdquo; is all marketing expenditure other than base marketing. Some of this marketing expenditure goes on advertising. Incremental marketing expenditure can be funded by expired unclaimed prizes and/or by the Operator.  <i><i></i></i></p><p>The current National Lottery advertisement states &ldquo;<i>Did you know that 90% of your money goes back into the community? Community means 56% Prizes, 29% Good Causes, 5% Retailer Commission. Based on 2021 financials.</i>&rdquo; The advertisement describes the remaining 10% of sales revenue as going to &ldquo;<i>Running Costs and Profit</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>The National Lottery is regulated by an independent Regulator created under the National Lottery Act 2013. As part of her role, the Regulator monitors the advertisements of the National Lottery to ensure that they are compliant with the terms of the Licence and a detailed Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice which conforms to advertising standards generally in the State.  </p><p>The Regulator of the National Lottery reviewed this advertisement when it first aired and found that it complied with the Licence and the Code. As detailed below, the 90% figure is the sum of three figures that each accurately reflect the 2021 audited accounts of the Operator (shortly to be laid before the Oireachtas) and the terms of the licence to operate the National Lottery. The remainder goes to the Operator of the National Lottery.</p><p>- The figures of 56% going to prizes and 29% going to good causes used in the advertisement accurately reflect the 2021 audited accounts of the Operator of the National Lottery (extract from page 3 below),. </p><p>Extract from Audited Accounts of Premier Lotteries Ireland DAC </p><p>For financial year ended 31 December 2021  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sales  </td>       <td>&euro;1053.7m</td>       <td>&euro;918.9m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Prizes</td>       <td>&euro;585.9m </td>       <td>&euro;528.9m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Good Causes</td>       <td>&euro;304.0m</td>       <td>&euro;253.6m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The figure of 5% of overall sales going to retailer commission accurately reflects the requirements of the licence to pay a 6% commission to retailers and the level of retail sales in 2021. </p><p>Clause 4.7 of the Licence to operate the National Lottery provides that the Operator must pay retailers a percentage commission of 6% for all National Lottery Games (except Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 for which the rate must be 5%). Where a ticket for a National Lottery game is sold online, there is no commission to be paid as the operator is the retailer.  The 2021 audited accounts of the operator of the National Lottery report that 16.6% of National Lottery sales were online in 2021 and 84.4% were in retail. That is, around five sixths of National Lottery sales, by value, came through retail agents and resulted in commission to retailers &ndash; i.e. total retail commission represented 5% of total sales in 2021.  </p></reply>

These are the most recent figures available.</p><p>When one looks back over the years since the License commenced, one finds that the sum of the shares of sales going to prizes, good causes and retailer commission is around 90% in each year of the operation of the National Lottery (varying between 89% and 91%).</p><p>For example, the 2021 audited accounts also show the corresponding figures for 2020 of 58% going to prizes and 28% going to good causes. Adding retailer commission of 5% yields and a total of 91% and thus 9% remaining for the Operator.</p><p>The 2021 Annual Report of the Regulator of the National Lottery (also to be laid before the Oireachtas shortly) provides the percentage of sales going to Prizes and the amount generated for Good Causes for every year of operation since the current Licence commenced. As the extracted table below shows, the individual percentages of sales vary slightly from year to year but these variations are marginal. Ultimately, the sum of the percentages going to prizes, good causes and retailer commissions comes to circa 90% in each year of operation.</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-09-14_pq187-14-09-22_en.docx">Table</a></p></reply>

The National Lottery gaming system only sells tickets between the hours of 7am to 11pm.</p><p>2.  The types of games that the National Lottery may sell are strictly limited.</p><p>3.  Every new game or change to an existing game must be pre-approved by the Regulator. </p><p>4.  Each new game or change to an existing game is considered by the Regulator with regard to the risk of addiction or problem-play.</p><p>5.  Retailers and the operator&rsquo;s customer service staff are trained in the warning signs of addiction and problem-play.</p><p>6.  Rules to ensure that the advertising and promotion of the National Lottery is appropriate for the nature of the product are in place and enforced by the Regulator.</p><p>7.  Direct marketing and upselling are prohibited except where a player has opted in to receiving marketing messages or the Regulator approves of a direct marketing campaign (which has not been the case to date).</p><p>8.  The National Lottery websites and tickets provide links to information on problem gambling and relevant resources. </p><p>In retail specifically:</p><p>9.  Mystery shop exercises are regularly conducted to ensure that retailers are complying with the requirement not to sell a ticket to a person under 18 years of age and the Think 21 requirement to ask for proof of age. (Minors are at greater risk of developing addiction.)</p><p>10.  There is a limit on the number of scratch cards a player can purchase in a transaction. </p><p>Online specifically:</p><p>11.  There are limits on the amount of money a player can spend online on any day, week or month.</p><p>12.  Prizes over &euro;100 are sent directly to the player and not paid into their online wallet, to discourage players from reinvesting winnings.</p><p>13.  To open an online account and purchase a National Lottery ticket you must supply a photo of an identity document that proves you are at least 18 years old.</p><p>14.  The online channel offers a self-exclusion facility to those who require assistance with limiting their National Lottery play.</p><p>15.

In this context, my Department, in collaboration with Civil Service employers, Trade Unions and Staff Associations, has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations.</p>  <p>  The Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the Civil Service and will assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public service. The Framework supports commitments contained in a number of strategies which this Government has launched. These include the National Remote Working Strategy, Our Rural Future, the Climate Action Plan and the National Planning Framework. </p>  <p>  I, along with Minister of State Smyth, published the Framework in March this year.  The Framework provides broad strategic direction to individual organisations in the Civil Service to develop tailored policies on blended working that are appropriate to their business needs.  In developing their own blended working policies, Departments and Offices have the flexibility to determine matters such as the roles that are suitable for blended working and the proportion of time individual employees work remotely versus onsite.</p>  <p>  The role of the Civil Service is to provide efficient, high-quality services and Departments and Offices must determine how the implementation of blended working arrangements will align with their business needs.  Therefore, access to blended working by civil servants must be dependent on Departments and Offices having the ability to meet the needs of their business.  Remote working will not be available to employees on a 100 percent basis as some physical attendance at workplaces will be required to facilitate face-to-face meetings, training and other key events deemed necessary by the employer.</p>  <p>  In relation to workplace energy costs incurred by the State, a suite of energy-efficiency measures across the public sector has recently been approved by the Cabinet.  All public sector bodies will, from September, take a leading role in lowering their energy consumption and costs as a first step in the new Autumn Reduce Your Use energy-efficiency campaign.  This campaign is designed to target reductions in energy use, including, targeted reductions in energy use by public sector bodies, through simple and easy to implement measures such as making more efficient use of buildings where occupancy is low, at certain times, due to remote working. This initiative is the first in a series of actions expected on energy efficiency, security and supply over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The OPW has recently carried out an accelerated procurement procedure to engage a main contractor for site preparation work and the acquisition, transportation and installation of the modular homes. </p>  <p>  The site selection process was coordinated initially by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with information on potential state owned sites provided by each Local Authority and other public authorities.   The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been assessing the sites that are considered suitable, having regard to their proximity to various facilities and local services such as retail, schools, health services and public transport.  The OPW is continuing the process of initial surveys on a range of sites to assess site-specific suitability from a technical perspective. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with support from the OPW, is currently carrying out a community engagement programme, involving direct contact with representatives of local communities living adjacent to sites selected for the installation of modular homes, to apprise them of the details of the programme and its impact on their area.</p>  <p>  Given the emergency nature of this significantly accelerated programme, the development of modular homes by the OPW will be on State owned land.  Therefore, while there are no plans at this stage for OPW / State involvement at the site referenced by the Deputy, other options like the proposal received from the Deputy may be considered if the situation changes.</p></reply>

It underpins a key Programme for Government commitment and it is notable that this coincides with Irish having become a full working language of the EU Institutions since January.</p><p>The achievement of an ambitious 20% recruitment target of proficient Irish speakers by 2030 requires a cross-Government approach. The Act provides that within 6 months of the date of enactment, the Minister shall establish an Irish Languages Services Advisory Committee.  Accordingly, Minister Martin and I established this Committee in June of this year. The committee is chaired by the Director of Irish at my Department and has representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service (&quot;PAS&quot;) as provided for under section 18B. (3)(a), (b) and (c) of the Act. </p><p>The functions of this Committee are set out in the Act and include the preparation of a National Plan, within two years of its establishment, to increase the provision of services through the medium of Irish as well periodic surveying of the number of Irish speakers employed by the public service.  </p><p>To that end, after discussing the various possibilities regarding the approach to the National Plan and the research that could be commissioned for it, the Committee decided at its first meeting on 25 July 2022, that it would issue a Request for Tenders through the open procurement method before the end of August 2022. The Request for Tenders was published by my Department on the  e-tendering platform and in the Official Journal of the European Union supplement (OJ/S) at the end of last month. The deadline for submitting tenders is 1pm on the 30 September 2022. </p><p>It is envisaged that this will be a one-year contract to ensure that the Committee complies with the ambitious deadline set for the preparation of the overall Plan under the Act.  Research priorities will include: </p><p>- Identifying the current gaps in the provision of public services through the medium of Irish and making recommendations on how to address these; </p><p>- Identifying the public services provided in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas (LPA) and making recommendations as to how to ensure that Irish is the working language of those offices located in each LPA and as to how services for Gaeltacht communities  are to be provided through the medium of Irish; </p><p>- Identifying the current level of competence in Irish in the public sector; and </p><p>- Making recommendations regarding the recruitment of people with Irish.</p><p>It is expected that the measures referred to above, in addition to other new initiatives aimed at promoting Irish speaking roles in the public service, will, over the years leading up to 2030 and beyond, result in increased numbers of applicants for these roles.</p><p>Some of the actions that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PAS are already taking to increase the number of fluent Irish speakers in the civil service include </p><p> - <b>Dedicated recruitment and promotion competitions targeted at Irish language speakers:</b>Since the summer of 2021, PAS has held general civil service competitions for individuals with fluency in Irish at Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Principal Officer level.The out-turn of these competitions reflects that the number of fluent Irish speakers applying to join the civil service, or otherwise declaring a fluency in Irish, remains low. </p><p>I am advised by PAS that since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, a total of 44 candidates have been assigned from panels established by recruitment competitions - ranging from Clerical Officer to Principal Officer level - where fluency in Irish was required for the post in question and for which proficiency in Irish was tested as part of the PAS assessment process.  </p><p>Additionally, up until the end of June 2022, PAS has assigned 101 candidates from competitions to posts where Irish was not identified by the hiring employer as a prerequisite for the post in question and where the candidate declared as part of their application that they had fluency in Irish. Their proficiency in Irish was not, however, tested as part of the PAS assessment process.</p><p>It is possible that some Departments or Government Officers may also have recruited fluent speakers directly under their local recruitment licence instead of PAS. </p><p>- <b>Irish language training in the civil service: </b>Along with the recruitment of staff with sufficient Irish language skills, the provision of Irish language training for the civil service is of particular importance, in order to enhance the linguistic abilities of current civil servants. OneLearning, the Learning and Development Centre for the civil service, was set up in 2017 and is responsible for delivering common training to all Civil Service Bodies (CSBs). </p><p>Irish language training courses continue to be made available to all existing civil servants via OneLearning - the Learning and Development Centre for the Civil Service based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>Since 2018, 1,454 civil servants have enrolled on an Irish language training course through OneLearning.  470 enrolments of these enrolments were in 2021 and 179 to date in 2022. </p><p>OneLearning signed a new contract for the provision of Irish language training in 2021 and is currently rolling out an expanded range of Irish Language training courses that will include the introduction of a Beginner&rsquo;s Irish course. The first term of these courses is commencing this month.  The Irish Language courses will be certified by Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge (TEG), which is administered by the Centre for Irish Language at Maynooth University. It is a comprehensive, graded system that allows learners to undertake examinations at five different levels of proficiency. The various levels in TEG are broadly based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching and Assessment (Council of Europe, 2001). </p><p>It is my expectation that these new measures and others introduced in the years ahead will increase the level and number of Irish medium services available to the public.</p></reply>

While the Commission recommended a move to a fully-Exchequer funded model, Government is of the opinion that any funding model should retain and build on the existing revenue stream from the sale of TV licences which provides an important direct link between broadcasters and the Irish public, and one which has underpinned the independence of the broadcasting sector.  Government has agreed to establish a Technical Working Group to examine the necessary reform required of the current TV licence system to properly provide for the funding requirements of public service media in Ireland. The Group has commenced its work and will report to Government on its progress in November.</p>  <p>  The Government is currently considering a range of measures to bring forward in Budget 2023 to assist households in meeting the rising costs of living.</p></reply>

The Housing Agency undertook to carry out this analytical exercise on behalf of my Department to better understand what level of discretion should be made available to Local Authorities under HAP to maintain adequate levels of support. </p>  <p>  Following receipt and analysis of this review, I, in cooperation with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, approved an increase in the HAP discretion rate from 20% to 35% and for new tenancies to extend the couple&rsquo;s rate to single person households. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.

The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024 and prohibit any necessary rent increase in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).  The Act also provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time. </p><p>To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for July 2022 shows HICP inflation of 9.6% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted to provide, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs where the inflation rate is higher. In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2022 (RTA) prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent.</p><p>Section 24A of the RTA provides that the Housing Agency, in consultation with housing authorities, may make a proposal to me, as Minister, that an area should be considered as a RPZ. Following receipt of such a proposal, I, as Minister, request the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to me on whether the area should be designated as a RPZ.</p><p>The criteria to be satisfied by an area under section 24A(4) of the Acts for designation as an RPZ are as follows:</p><p>- the information relating to the area, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent Index quarterly report, shows that the annual rate of increase in the average amount of rent for that area is more than 7% in each of at least 4 of the 6 quarters preceding the period immediately prior to the date of the Housing Agency's proposal, and </p><p>- the average rent for the area in the last quarter, as determined by reference to the information used to compile each RTB Rent  Index quarterly report, is &ndash; </p><p>- in  the case of counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow or a local electoral area (LEA) in any one of those counties, above the average rent in the State, excluding rents in the 4 Dublin Local Authority areas, or  </p><p>- in the case of any LEA outside of the Greater Dublin Area (i.e. Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow), above the average rent in the State excluding rents in the Greater Dublin Area.</p><p>Each RTB quarterly Rent Index Report includes a table of the data used to establish whether each LEA fulfils the criteria for designation as a RPZ.</p><p>The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if any LEA in county Donegal meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ.<b></b></p></reply>

The Framework recognises the strategic importance of Drogheda and aims to support its development and its economic potential as part of the Dublin-Belfast Corridor and in particular the core Drogheda-Dundalk-Newry network. Drogheda&rsquo;s role is reflected at a regional level in the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) for the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA) area. The RSES targets significant growth into the regional growth centres, including Drogheda, to enable them to act as regional drivers. In 2021 both Meath and Louth County Councils adopted new Development Plans which further underline the importance of Drogheda as a key urban centre in both counties.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the consultation was to encourage as many people as possible to have their say in respect of a referendum on housing in Ireland. More than 2,000 submission have been received and the Commission is pleased that there has been a  broad response from members of the public, tenants, landlords, public representatives, organisations involved in housing, the charity sector, the community &amp;amp; voluntary sector, people working in related policy and legal areas and elsewhere. The majority of submissions received came from the general public and reflect a range of disparate views which will greatly assist the Commission in its task of providing independent advice to the government on a potential constitutional amendment.  The submissions are currently being processed and will then be analysed to inform the Commission&rsquo;s deliberations on a proposed wording for a referendum. The submissions will provide invaluable input from the public and stakeholders to assist the Commission in its task of providing independent advice to the government.  </p>  <p>  The proposed timeline for a referendum on housing will be a matter for Government to consider following receipt of the proposed wording from the Commission.  </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  Recently a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m was announced. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station and other works were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, local fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>  - established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>  - state of development of the project (if a site has been acquired?, etc.); and </p>  <p>  - value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money, taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  In October 2020, grant aid approval was provided to Kerry County Council by my Department for the extension and upgrade works to Killarney Fire station. Subsequently, Kerry County Council have indicated that the original tender could not proceed. Kerry County Council have indicated that the extension and refurbishment works to Killarney Fire station remains their first priority and are now pursuing a new tender process for the required works.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. </p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.

The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the SEA process ran from 15 June 2022 to 13 July 2022. My Department is currently reviewing written submissions and observations received as part of the public consultation, which will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. It is intended that the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Under Action 6 of the strategy for built vernacular heritage, A Living Tradition, which I launched in December 2021, my Department has undertaken to &ldquo;investigate and work to resolve the urgent issue of affordability of insurance for thatched buildings&rdquo; and other relevant issues relating to thatch and thatched buildings. </p>  <p>  Insurance is being urgently examined as this has become an acute problem for many owners of thatched properties. A study is under way to examine the issues relating to insurance for thatch and I expect an interim report by the end of this month and a final report by the end of November. As part of the study, officials in my Department have been canvassing thatch owners for their views and experience of securing insurance for their properties. Officials have also consulted with insurance companies and brokers, in Ireland and abroad, fire authorities, and other relevant bodies, to get their assistance in resolving the issue. </p>  <p>  On the basis of the recommendations set out in the report, and any avenues for progress that suggest themselves in the meantime, my Department will work urgently to seek practical solutions to the thatch insurance issue.</p>  <p>  I have established a steering group to assist my Department in the implementation actions relating to thatch insurance, and wider actions in relation to thatching skills, thatching materials, and the surveying and recording of thatched buildings. Two members of the group are thatch owners, including a thatcher, another is a thatching grant inspector, and the others have key roles in relevant outside bodies. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to offer a number of financial supports to owners of protected structures, including thatched properties. Under my Department&rsquo;s grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs, there is a grant of up to &euro;3,810 available, where a house is used as a normal place of residence; in the case of medical card holders, the grant can be up to &euro;6,350; and on certain offshore islands the grant can rise to &euro;8,252. </p>  <p>  Other streams of grant assistance to thatch owners include the Historic Structures Fund, a stream of which is directed towards vernacular buildings that are not on a local authority record of protected structures, and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme. I secured combined funding of &euro;8m for these schemes in 2022 and it is intended to run them again in 2023; details of next year's schemes will be made available in November.</p></reply>

Housing for All is a plan with real ambition, guaranteed investment and fresh ideas to deliver housing for real people and create a long-term sustainable housing system. Guaranteed State investment of over &euro;4 billion a year in housing is aimed at increasing supply, which in turn will help increase access to affordable housing to buy or rent.</p>  <p>  Housing supply is increasing, despite unprecedented challenges. Since the middle of 2021, over 54,000 new homes have been either built (24,916) or commenced (29,343). Last year, 9,183 social homes were provided.</p>  <p>  This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.</p>  <p>  Among the main measures delivered since Housing for All was launched in September 2021 are:</p>  <p>  -  A Government budget of &euro;4 billion for investment in housing in 2022, with a further &euro;4 billion committed for 2023. The 2022 budget is an increase of 20% on 2021;</p>  <p>  -  The introduction of four affordable purchase initiatives: First Home scheme; a local authority-provided Affordable Purchase scheme; a revised Local Authority Home Loan scheme; the Project Tosaigh scheme by the Land Development Agency;</p>  <p>  -  A new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund to address the current viability challenges and activate housing supply at density in city centres through the delivery of 5,000 apartments;</p>  <p>  -  The rollout of Cost Rental, a new form of State-backed secure, long-term rental tenure through which rents are aimed at a minimum of 25% below open market rates;</p>  <p>  -  Significant funding to assist local authority affordable housing delivery, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). To date, more than 1,000 local authority affordable purchase homes have been approved for funding under the AHF;</p>  <p>  -  Further protections for renters including legislation enacted last year that caps any rent increases in a Rent Pressure Zone at 2% per annum pro rata when the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices is higher;</p>  <p>  -  To reduce current cost pressures in construction and increase standardisation, the government and the Construction Sector Group have commissioned a study on the cost of construction;</p>  <p>  -  The Government also implemented the Inflation Co-Operation Framework, which sees the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary costs on public works contracts;</p>  <p>  -  Legislative underpinning to a new requirement that residential houses be ring-fenced for individual buyers &ndash; almost 16,000 units restricted to single purchasers or social and affordable housing by mid-May as a result of restrictions on permissions, with legislative provision incorporated in housing strategies and development plans going forward;</p>  <p>  -  To increase supply, legislation introducing a Residential Zoned Land Tax (commencing in 2024 following publication of maps showing land in scope). Coupled with legislation being developed to introduce Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones, these reforms will help (1) activate vacant land zoned and serviced for housing (2) reduce land hoarding that drives up the value of land and cost of housing and (3) ensure greater community gain from land value increases. Community gain will secured through a proportion of the uplift in land values for the provision of infrastructure to support development and, where appropriate, social and affordable housing;</p>  <p>  -  To tackle vacancy, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund provides a new Vacant Properties Refurbishment Grant; a new Town Centre First policy and changes to the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to renting or selling vacant property;</p>  <p>  -  Measures to increase construction sector capacity, including greater investment to increase the availability of apprenticeships and training, international recruitment initiatives and the new &lsquo;Future Building&rsquo; initiative to spearhead activation and recruitment for the sector;</p>  <p>  -  A number of significant measures to accelerate research and innovation in the sector, including Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new Built to Innovate Fund, a &euro;5 million investment for the establishment of a new Construction Technology Centre, and the turning the sod on a new Modern Methods of Construction Demonstration Park, which will focus on increasing specialised training capacity and allow us to better respond to skills gaps in the construction sector;</p>  <p>  -  More resources have been provided to local authorities to deliver social and affordable housing, including sanction for additional housing posts; the streamlining of pre-construction procurement and delivery of social housing (including the de-risking of potential delays) by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies; the issuing of guidelines to improve the design and delivery of housing, and ensure the delivery of social and affordable housing is based on need and demand;</p>  <p>  -  The enactment of the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Act to provide a statutory register for builders</p>  <p>  While global and external challenges have emerged since Housing for All was published in September 2021, the Government and I remain focused on achieving the targets set out therein. As committed to last year, when Housing for All was launched, the Government will review and update the actions in the plan. The updated actions will be published in the autumn. This will allow us to respond to these challenges and redouble our focus on prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January last for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. Further information on the scheme, including terms and conditions, is available on the dedicated website localauthorityhomeloan.ie/.</p><p>Launched on 7 July this year, the First Home Scheme supports first-time buyers and also applicants under the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle. It is being delivered by First Home Scheme DAC, a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders. The Scheme will improve access to newly-built homes on the private market by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. Support of up to 30% of the home value (or 20% if Help to Buy is also utilised) is the maximum available under the scheme. The homes must be priced within regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by first-time buyers in each area, and will therefore support home purchases in the lower region of the market. Further details on this scheme can be found at www.firsthomescheme.ie/.</p><p>The Help to Buy incentive can in its own right can support first-time buyers in obtaining a newly-built house or apartment, or a self-build home. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. Further information on the Help to Buy incentive is available at .</p><p>I can confirm that Departmental funding has been made available via the Affordable Housing Fund to local authorities to support their delivery of affordable via the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. This scheme assists first-time buyers purchasing Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit.</p><p>Finally, matters such as mortgage deposit requirements and borrowing limits come under the remit of the Central Bank of Ireland, which is an independent body. However, it should be noted that there are limited exemptions allowed to these rules. For first-time buyers, 20% of mortgages can be above the standard 3.5x income limit, and 5% of mortgages can have a lower deposit that the normal 10% required. Relevant information is available at the following Central Bank links:</p><p>www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/what-are-the-mortgage-measures and</p><p>www.centralbank.ie/financial-system/financial-stability/macro-prudential-policy/mortgage-measures.</p></reply>

Details of the announcement can be found at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/f2fa6-minister-obrien-announces-50-million-in-funding-to-improve-the-waste-water-needs-of-rural-villages/ </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;50 million has been committed under the National Development Plan for the new measure, which will focus on areas of most need based on housing and environmental criteria. It is expected that at least ten demonstration projects will be supported under this first round of funding. The demonstration project model will allow for the development of appropriate longer-term strategies, protocols and better inform future funding needs for the progressive development of public waste water collection and treatment infrastructure in villages/settlements that are currently without these services.</p>  <p>  Details of the scheme, including terms and conditions and the relevant accompanying documents are available at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/a524a-group-water-schemes-and-rural-water-issues/#waste-water-collection-and-treatment-needs-for-villages-and-settlements-without-access-to-public-waste-water-services.</p>  <p>  It is now open to all local authorities to submit applications for funding and I would strongly encourage them to do so. Completed applications should be submitted in advance of the deadline of 15 September 2022. To date my Department has not yet received any applications. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for Clare County Council to decide which villages or settlements within their functional area meet the criteria set out in the framework.</p></reply>

The Scheme uses regional price ceilings based on the median prices of new-build first-time buyer homes. This is to temper any inflationary pressures and to target support at the lower part of the price distribution in each area, as well as to encourage additional housing supply at this price level. Full details of the First Home Scheme, including price ceilings, are available on the scheme website: www.firsthomescheme.ie.</p>  <p>  The setting of the initial First Home Scheme price ceilings was informed primarily by an analysis of the most relevant CSO data, specifically the national Residential Property Price Index (RPPI), together with a review of concurrent market data and sales prices for new homes by first-time buyers. The system will broadly reflect price trends, and represent a clear, easily understandable method for utilising appropriate price ceilings. </p>  <p>  Any system of geographically-based price ceilings will require defined borders. Inevitably, this will result in examples of homes on either side of given borders with differing price ceilings. However, when considered in the overall, the system will broadly reflect price trends, and represent a clear, easily understandable method for utilising appropriate price ceilings.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme Designated Activity Company (DAC) now holds responsibility for reviewing and updating price ceilings nationally, as required. The First Home Scheme has confirmed a review of ceilings will be undertaken after six months of operation of the scheme, and periodically thereafter. This is to ensure any ceilings allow the scheme to deliver on its underlying objectives.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme can be contacted directly at www.firsthomescheme.ie/get-in-touch/.</p></reply>

Ireland takes every opportunity to stress the need for respect for human rights and full accountability, including regarding the actions of the Israeli security forces.</p>  <p>  I draw the attention of the Deputy to the joint statement released by Ireland with the Foreign Ministries of  Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, following the raids of six Palestinian NGOs by the Israeli Defence Forces on 18 August, labelling these actions as unacceptable, expressing concern at the further reduction of civil space in the oPt, and standing firm with NGOs to uphold the right to freedom of expression and association in the oPt. </p>  <p>  Following the issuing of this statement, Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv also took part in a meeting with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with the EU Delegation and 16 other European states, to express concern over these actions.</p>  <p>  I strongly condemned the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin on 11 May 2022 as she carried out her vital work as a journalist. Media freedom and the safety of journalists must be protected, including in situations of conflict, and I called for an impartial, independent and effective investigation. Accountability must be ensured and those responsible brought to justice. The use of force against mourners by the Jerusalem police was wholly unacceptable and rightly attracted widespread condemnation.</p>  <p>  My Department is in contact on an ongoing basis with the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin and has raised all these issues with her, in addition to our engagement with the Israeli authorities through our Ambassador in Tel Aviv. </p></reply>

Ireland engages regularly on these issues in the context of the EU, including through my attendance at the EU Foreign Affairs Council, and regular bilateral contacts with my EU counterparts. The Middle East Peace Process is also a key priority for Ireland during our current tenure on the UN Security Council, and Ireland engages actively in monthly Security Council meetings on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question. In the coming days I will be travelling to New York to attend the United Nations High General Assembly High Level Week, where the Middle East Peace Process will be a focus of my discussions with a number of key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Regarding the situation on the ground, I have strongly conveyed our concerns on a number of issues when engaging with the Israeli Government, including in relation to illegal settlement expansion in the occupied Palestinian territory, and will continue to do so. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Tel Aviv also expresses our concerns directly in its regular contacts with the Israeli authorities.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to a two-State solution, and will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties.</p></reply>

In developing the Passport Online service a significant focus was placed on ensuring that a high level of accessibility was reached from the beginning. In the request for tender for the website development contract a minimum of conformance level AA with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was required. The contractor who was awarded the tender agreed to develop the website to the principles of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust, which are the principles of WCAG 2.0.</p><p>Specific accessibility-focused user experience testing was conducted by an external agency during August 2018, where five users of different demographics, technical abilities and needs were sourced to test the online platform using screen readers, screen magnification and speech recognition. The testing included persons who are partially sighted, colour blind, have dyslexia and other cognitive issues, and are arthritic. All users were successful in navigating the website and completing the online application process, the reporting noting that the feedback was very positive. The testing was also useful in highlighting some areas for improvement which have since been addressed. </p><p>The Passport Service also met with the AsIAm charity during July 2018 where a discussion around the specific needs of persons with autism was held and a demonstration of the Passport Online service was provided.  Feedback from AsIAm was very positive with references to the simple and clear layout and sufficient white space throughout the online process.</p><p>As certain application types cover complex areas such as guardianship, the Passport Service places the utmost importance on using plain English throughout the application process. Following a number of internal workshops using the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Customer Communications Toolkit to simplify the language, the Passport Service engaged the National Adult Literary Agency (NALA) who reviewed all screens in the application process and suggested a number of changes to ensure the service is understandable and accessible to all. In 2019, the Passport Service won the National Adult Literary Agency (NALA) award for Plain English for the Passport Online Renewal service. </p><p>An external and independent body conducted an Access and Sensory Audit of the Passport Service's public offices in Mount St, Dublin in 2020.</p><p>In cases where passport applicants have a medical condition or disability that means that the standard passport photo guidelines cannot be met, the Passport Online service offers a medical indicator option when submitting a digital passport photo.</p><p>When applying online, passport applicants or their parents can tick the medical indicator box on the passport photo page. This allows the photo to pass through the system as part of the application process. The passport photo submitted will then be reviewed by a member of the Passport Service staff.</p><p>In accordance with section 26 of the Disability Act 2005, my Department has an appointed Access Officer who is responsible for ensuring that help and advice are given to people with disabilities who wish to access our services.</p><p>The Access Officer can be contacted through a form on my Department&rsquo;s website, here: www.dfa.ie/about-us/contact-us/contact-access-officer/ </p><p>Alternatively, the Access Officer can be contacted by post at the following address:</p><p>Access Officer</p><p>Human Resources HQ</p><p>Department of Foreign Affairs</p><p>76-78 Harcourt Street</p><p>Dublin 2</p><p>D02 DX45</p><p>Customers can also contact my Department's Disability Inquiry Officer via the website (www.dfa.ie/about-us/contact-us/) and their case will be communicated to the Passport Service who can facilitate their request. The Inquiry Officer will investigate any complaints made under Section 38 of the Disability Act.</p><p>A member of the public who may require the assistance of an Irish Sign Language Interpreter during an appointment at the Passport Service public office can indicate this when booking their appointment online. A dedicated member of staff will be available to interpret and assist during their appointment.</p><p>Passport Customer Service is available Monday to Friday, from 9am to 4:30pm by phone or WebChat on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports). These facilities offer all customers live interaction with customer service officers who can advise on matters relating to the passport application process.</p><p>The Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance the provision of this essential service to all of our citizens.  <i></i></p></reply>

Recognising the recurrent nature of drought crises in the region, we are also investing in anticipatory action to mitigate the impact of future shocks. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;33 million in development funding over the last two years to communities across the Horn of Africa, including in partnership with Irish NGOs, to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity and to build community resilience.</p><p>I visited Kenya and South Sudan at the end of August, and witnessed first-hand the devastation caused by the drought and the impact of the crisis on vulnerable communities in the region. On 6 September, I announced an additional funding package of &euro;3.2 million to respond to growing needs in the Horn of Africa, including &euro;1.5 million to Irish NGO partners already active in the region delivering life-saving assistance to those most in need and &euro;500,000 to UNICEF responding to child malnutrition.</p><p>In addition to direct humanitarian assistance, communities in the Horn are being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which reacts immediately to crises as they happen. Ireland is the eighth largest contributor to CERF, providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated over $302 million for emergency relief across the region.</p><p>Ireland is also a consistent advocate for increased support to the Horn of Africa at a global level<b>.</b>On 26 April we delivered a statement at the high-level roundtable chaired by the UN and the EU on the drought in the Horn, at which member states pledged $1.3bn to the humanitarian response. On 7 July, Minister Coveney met with UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed in New York to discuss the situation in the Horn of Africa, including opportunities for greater EU-UN coordination in the collective response to the crisis. </p><p>More broadly, Ireland has been a long-standing champion of global efforts to reduce hunger and malnutrition, working with a range of partners to address the worst consequences of food insecurity. As focal point on hunger and conflict at the Security Council, we have highlighted the underlying causes of food insecurity and the links between conflict and hunger, together with the impact of climate change. </p><p>We have underlined the importance of the recent conclusions approved by the Foreign Affairs Council on the Team Europe response to global food insecurity.  The EU has pledged over &euro;600 million in support of the Horn of Africa. As part of the overall EU Global Food Security Response, the EU has identified a total contribution of over &euro;5 billion in humanitarian and development assistance for global food security from 2021 to 2024.</p></reply>

We had a constructive phone call where we discussed a number of matters, including our shared priority of addressing the ongoing absence of the power-sharing Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland.  I underlined the importance of the partnership approach between our two governments and our responsibilities as co-Guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  We also discussed plans for future engagement such as the forthcoming BIIGC and our intention to meet together in person in the weeks ahead. I look forward to working closely with the Secretary of State and his team.</p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with the Secretary of State and indeed with the Northern Ireland political parties in the period ahead. Strong relationships and honest conversations East-West and North-South must and should remain at the heart of this Government's approach. I firmly believe that by working together in a spirit of cooperation we can jointly find solutions to the range of issues facing Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p>  <p>  School transport is a hugely important service for families.  My Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The scope of the review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of the review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021, with regard to eligibility and with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  </p>  <p>Following consideration of this report, for the 2021/2022 school year, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  These measures will be continued for the current school year, pending completion of the review and means transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation; including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p>  <p>  While work on the review is being impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible.</p></reply>

Full information on the process is available on Gov.ie.</p>  <p>  Children who for the first time require School Transport for the 2022/2023 school year will need to apply in line with this process. Due to the ongoing situation with accommodation, where there has been, and may continue to be, significant movement of families, all Ukrainian children who had availed of School Transport for the 2021/22 school year need to re-apply for transport for the 2022/23 school year in line with this process.</p>  <p>  Applications continue to be received on a daily basis as families are relocated or as new families arrive. </p>  <p>  School transport can only be arranged once the School Transport Section have been made aware of transport needs for children arriving from Ukraine.

Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post-primary school/education centre are deemed eligible. </p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. </p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29<sup>th</sup>April and registered for a ticket by the 29<sup>th</sup>July.</p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p><p>Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p><p>It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &quot;late application&quot; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.  Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants.</p></reply>

My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen 383 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2535 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school year. The 383 new special classes for 22/23 is broken down by 253 at primary and 130 at post-primary.</p><p>The list of classes for the 22/23 school year is available on the NCSE website (as of 6th July) and is available at the link below.</p><p>06Jul22_Special-Classes-for-publication-2022_2023.pdf (ncse.ie)</p><p>The NCSE has engaged with the school regarding their interest in establishing a special class.

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the schemes, apply their own arrangements as resources permit. Schools may elect to contract services from a commercial service provider or to employ individuals directly to provide cleaning services.  Where a school elects to employ someone directly to support this function, that individual is a direct employee of the individual school and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school / Board of Management.   </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.

Inclusive Education has been strengthened in the revised standards which recognise the diverse range of needs that teachers encounter in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting, and specifically reference additional learning needs such as autism in this context. As part of the Review and Accreditation process, all programmes of ITE will have to provide evidence of how the core elements are explored and examined with student teachers during the course of their programme. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is currently working on a policy statement for ITE which we anticipate will be published later this year.  The objective of the policy statement is to document the current policy and provision for ITE at primary and post-primary level in order to increase clarity to the system. The Department also intends to set out its vision for the sector along with a plan of action to achieve this over the coming decade.</p>  <p>  We have invited a range of advocacy groups to meet with Department officials who are drafting the policy statement, including groups that advocate on behalf of children with autism.  We want to ensure that teachers are equipped to support all learners at school in the coming years.  The Department welcomes their contributions and anticipate that they will provide a valuable insight into how ITE can be improved so that teachers are fully prepared to support all learners to reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s/he will have access to an appropriate education. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which is a separate statutory agency, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for the provision of special educational needs supports to schools.</p>  <p>  The NCSE supports schools to build their capacity to support the inclusion of all children through a suite of professional learning opportunities. Each of the seminars and resources designed within the NCSE has been aligned with Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teacher&rsquo;s learning. The NCSE offers teachers a range of seminars and workshops for teachers in the area of autism.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) through their Primary, Language, Literacy, Reading Recovery &amp;amp; Gaeilge supports for teachers,  promote inclusive pedagogies and approaches that benefit all learners, including early literacy intervention models. The new primary language curriculum and support materials are based on best practices grounded in research for language and literacy for all learners in all contexts.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32 million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180 million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on 3 April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists, but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Where reasonable progress is not made, following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which run until 2024. OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and is advancing a number of programmes to further develop this.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability www.energyineducation.ie.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.

However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which run until 2024. OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and is advancing a number of programmes to further develop this.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability www.energyineducation.ie.

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS progamme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my Department&rsquo;s vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, my Department recognises that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

The Early Start programme was established in 1994, and is a one-year intervention to meet the needs of children aged between 3 years and 5 years who are at risk of not reaching their potential within the school system. It involves an educational programme to enhance overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The Early Start programme runs in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage, and has capacity for 1,620 children each year.  Early Start units are staffed by teachers and child care workers, and the role of the child care workers is to meet the care needs of all the children in the unit, including those children with special educational needs.  The programme opens each year to new child enrolments.  </p>  <p>  As the Early start programme is accommodated within existing primary school buildings, under my Department&rsquo;s grant schemes improvement works to a primary school building such as roof works, window replacement etc., would generally incorporate the part of the primary school building that is occupied by the Early Start programme.  Any changes to these grant schemes would be a policy matter and would also have to be considered in the context of overall budgets and wider priorities. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) is responsible for early years education outside the formal education system and my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has recently announced a &euro;10m Capital Grant for the Early Learning and Childcare Sector. The Building Blocks - Improvement Grant is part of a wider Building Blocks Capital Programme for Early Learning and Childcare under the National Development Plan.  Grants will range from &euro;35,000 to &euro;75,000 across two separate strands: Green Energy and Retrofit. Services that sign up for the new &euro;221m Core Funding Scheme are eligible for funding under for the Building Blocks Capital Programme.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant, from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities within the guidelines of DPER Circular 13/14, where the funding must be used for the purposes in which it was given for. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to Primary Schools in the form of a Minor Works Grant, this grant is primarily based on the number of students enrolled in the school.

While the issue of pay alone will not resolve these issues, the Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services, and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and the taxpayer. There is an important balance to be struck between maintaining industrial peace and protecting the Exchequer.  </p><p>The value of public pay deals to the Government and the taxpayer is ensuring that pay costs are managed in a sustainable and orderly way and in a climate of industrial peace. By and large public pay agreements have delivered on these objectives over the last 12 years.  Following the conclusion of discussions on 30 August, the parties to Building Momentum, with the expert assistance of the WRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals, to extend the terms of Building Momentum to 31 December 2023. Government have approved these proposals which have been published in full. It is now a matter for public service unions and associations representing the public service workforce to consider and ballot on those proposals. The proposals, if adopted by unions and staff representative associations, will provide stability in a period of significant global uncertainty. It is appropriate at this time to allow space for the respective union and association memberships to reflect on the proposals. </p><p>In recent years my Department has established a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers at both post-primary and primary levels, including the introduction of new programmes of initial teacher education and teacher upskilling programmes in targeted subject areas and the Teaching Transforms campaign, which encourages young people to follow a career in teaching. </p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools, including the large majority of primary schools in Dublin.  The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <b><i>Sub Seeker</i></b>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>The Council is also currently processing applications for registration from newly qualified teachers, who will represent a new source of supply in 2022/23. In excess of 3,200 primary and post-primary NQTs are registered to date with almost 100 further applications currently in progress. </p></reply>

In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018</p><p>Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. If a parent consider that a school has erred in their processing of their enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  </p><p>In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on the application. Where an error had a material effect on an enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned.</p><p>A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission. It is important to note that if a parent has been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent wishes  to appeal that decision they must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child in question.</p><p>If the child has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.  Where the child has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and does not seek a review by the board of management the parent may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p><p>Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/  </p><p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. Contact details for TESS are available at the following link www.tusla.ie/tess/get-in-touch/ or by email at tessinfo@tusla.ie  </p></reply>

This has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen 383 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,535 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 383 new special classes for 22/23 is broken down by 253 at primary and 130 at post primary.</p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>The Department recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can be a stressful experience. My Department is working hard to ensure that there are sufficient school places, appropriate to the needs of all children, available on a timely basis nationwide.  </p><p>Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes.</p><p>The NCSE through their network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organisers) are currently engaged in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. They are looking at local information in relation to projected demand for future special class places.</p><p>The local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: www.ncse.ie/regional-servic. </p><p>As the query refers to an individual child, I will arrange to have it referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-14a.946.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091400073#WRQ05300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 365 together.</p>  <p>The Community Welfare Service (CWS) of my Department delivers the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme which is the safety net within the overall social welfare system.  This scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  </p>  <p>  The CWS is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Based on the available data, it is estimated that 63% of all SWA payments are decided within 4 weeks from the date of application and 92% are decided within eight weeks of application.  50% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 0-4 weeks and 90% are finalised within 0-8 weeks.  Where an application is not finalised within this timeframe, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the customer to support their application.</p>  <p>  The Department has introduced innovations this year which have increased efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWO) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In addition, a new National CWS Claims Decisions Team is being established this month to work on finalising SWA applications.  Where claims require further contact with the customer or a home visit is required, the claim will remain with the local CWO to be finalised.  This Claims Decisions Team is based in multiple locations around the country.</p>  <p>  The delivery of crucial Community Welfare Services to meet the challenges and the needs of vulnerable customers across the country remains a priority for my Department. The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

IORP II requirements were transposed into Irish law by way of the European Union (Occupational Pension Schemes) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 128 of 2021) which came into force on 22nd April 2021. </p>  <p>  The general principle followed in respect of the transposition of IORP II, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform, is that the requirements of IORP II apply to all schemes and trust Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs), including one-member arrangements (OMAs).  This is in order to ensure that all members and beneficiaries are afforded equal protection irrespective of the size of the pension arrangement.  It should be noted that the decision to apply the requirements of IORP II to all schemes and trust RACs was announced by the Government in 2019 and it was expected that trustees and insurance providers would have been preparing for compliance with these requirements in advance of transposition.</p>  <p>  In the case of OMAs established on or after S.I. No. 128 of 2021, such arrangements are required to meet all new IORP II related requirements set out under the 1990 Act, where applicable, from the date on which they were established.  From a supervision perspective, the Pensions Authority, however, outlined that it was applying a deadline of 1st July 2022 in respect of OMA&rsquo;s compliance with those new requirements. </p>  <p>  The supervision of compliance with the requirements of both IORP II and the Pensions Act 1990 (&lsquo;1990 Act&rsquo;) is the responsibility of the Pensions Authority, which is the regulator for pensions in Ireland (and the competent authority within the meaning of the IORP II Directive). </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is an independent statutory body, and it would not be possible or appropriate for me to interfere with the Pensions Authority&rsquo;s compliance supervision function or to direct the Pensions Authority to extend any compliance deadlines relating to the provision of one-member arrangements (&lsquo;OMAs&rsquo;).  Furthermore, IORP II requires Member States to ensure that competent authorities, such as the Pensions Authority, conduct their tasks in a transparent, independent and accountable manner.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is fully exempt from income tax, PRSI and USC. The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150. The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year. It can also be paid to certain other carers providing full-time care. At the end of June some 121,551 grants were issued in respect of 136,054 care recipients.</p>  <p>  One of the principal conditions for receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Support is that full time care and attention is required and being provided. A carer will be regarded as providing full-time care and attention to a relevant person, where the number of hours providing such care is not less than 35 hours in a period of 7 consecutive days, and care is provided on any 5 days, whether consecutive or not, within a period of 7 consecutive days. The provision of full-time care and attention requirement is moderated somewhat by allowing a carer to work or engage in education or training for up to 18.5 hours per week. During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 18.5-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. </p>  <p>  There are a number of circumstances, set out in legislation, where a carer cannot not qualify for the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant including where a person is signing for credited contributions. A credit may be awarded (subject to certain qualifying conditions) for each week to bridge the gap between periods of insurable employment where a person has a break in their insurance record because of illness, unemployment or other eligible scenario. Under certain circumstances a person may be awarded credits without receiving a Benefit or Allowance payment. This may apply, for example, in the case of a person who has exhausted entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit but who does not qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance due to their means. In this case, the person may be entitled to 'sign' for credits to protect their other social insurance entitlements. In order to be entitled to Unemployment Credits, a person must be available for full-time employment, capable of work and must also be genuinely seeking work.  </p>  <p>  I do not intend to extend eligibility to the Carer's Support Grant in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy as it would be inconsistent with the intent of the payment. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund.  The Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021.  It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  The report set out a wide range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years). It recommended that long-term carers should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring.  The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory "Family Carer Register" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report need to be considered very carefully and holistically. My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  Once all of these matters are considered in detail, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Department is charged with identifying where a person has an income support need and providing that income support, for example in the form for instance of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, a disability allowance, or a carer's allowance. </p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by the Department of Social Protection are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. Spending in 2022 is expected to amount to over &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  - Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means-tested payment for people living in Ireland who are looking after someone who needs support because of age, physical or learning disability or illness, including mental illness. Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is primarily aimed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain people who need full-time care and attention. As of July there were 91,093 recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. </p>  <p>  There are other income supports available for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection that are not means-tested; these include:</p>  <p>  - The Carers Benefit payment is an entitlement based on social insurance contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is a payment made to insured people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person(s) in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of 2 years (104 weeks) for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of 2 years (104 weeks). As of July there were 3,346 recipients of Carer's Benefit. </p>  <p>  - The annual Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is available to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions. The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs. The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. As part of Budget Measures 2021, the rate of the grant was increased by &euro;150.  The new rate of &euro;1,850 came into effect from June 2021. The Carer's Support Grant is automatically paid to people in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care allowance in June of each year. At the end of June some 121,551 grants were issued in respect of 136,054 care recipients.</p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment for a child aged under 16 with a severe disability, who requires ongoing care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age.  It is not means tested. The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month. There is no restriction on the number of children in respect of whom Domiciliary Care Allowance may be claimed. In other words, a person caring for more than one child who qualifies for Domiciliary Care Allowance may claim the monthly allowance for each child. As of July there were 48,430 families in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance in respect of some 54,126 children. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, the Government introduced a range of measures benefitting family carers directly, including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all core weekly payments including carers;</p>  <p>  - a &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments;</p>  <p>  - an increase in the capital disregard for carers from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000;</p>  <p>  - the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has increased to &euro;350 per week for single carers, and to &euro;750 per week for a couple.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2022, the Government doubled the period of time for which Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are paid for children who are hospitalised. These supports now continue to be paid for 26 weeks, as opposed to the previous 13-week period, to the parents or guardians of children under 16. </p>  <p>  Apart from the income supports mentioned above, this Department also provides a support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Under this scheme, the Department may make an additional needs payment to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, considering all the circumstances of the case. This ensures that the payments target those most in need of assistance. The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently on a social welfare payment or working on a low income. Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is not possible to provide the estimated annual cost of providing a weekly payment of &euro;230 in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. The Department of Social Protection has no basis for collecting data on how many children require/or would require a hospital stay.</p>  <p>  This matter may be more relevant to my colleague the Minister for Health. Similar schemes are available in the UK and are available through the NHS; for example, people in the UK on a low income, may be able to get help with NHS costs, such as claims for help with travel costs if they are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16, through the NHS Low Income Scheme (LIS). </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is necessary for staff providing front line customer services to do so in-person at office locations.</p>  <p>  The number of staff who were working remotely at any one time across all business areas of the Department during 2021 was approximately 50% of the total staffing number. During 2022 to date, this number remained relatively constant and was a continuation of the temporary working arrangements put in place by local business areas.</p>  <p>  In March 2022, the Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations was published. In June 2022, my Department published a formal Blended Working Policy, informed by the Framework. The introduction of this formal policy draws a line under all prior temporary arrangements, with formal agreed Blended Working arrangements commencing on 12th September 2022.  Under the Policy, my Department will operate varied on-site attendance levels and patterns based on eligibility criteria to include business requirements, individual and role suitability, and remote workstation arrangements.  Work patterns range from a minimum attendance of 4 days per calendar month to full attendance on-site.</p>  <p>  To avail of Bended Working under the policy, staff must formally request a blended working arrangement by following an application process which takes the eligibility criteria into account as part of the decision making process. </p>  <p>As at 7th   September 2022, under the Policy, from 12th September, approximately 50% of the total staff number will have a formal agreement in place to commence a form of blended working arrangement from that date.  This can be broken down as follows: 662 have a formal agreement to work from home one day per week, 1040 officers two days per week and 2 officers five days per week. These formal agreements will end in December 2022 after which staff must apply again under the Blended Working Policy and follow an annual process thereafter. This is to support a rotation of opportunity for a wide number of staff to avail of Blended Working where possible.</p>  <p>  It is expected that these figures will change over time. This will include changes in the immediate term as staff return in September 2022 following planned absences including annual leave and shorter working year.  In the medium to longer term, numbers will evolve due to changing business needs, the annual application process, staff movement, changes in roles, and staff turnover.  There is also inherent flexibility in the policy for staff to opt-out of or adapt their blended working arrangements at any time subject to agreement, and inherent flexibility in the policy on the requirement for staff to attend onsite in person as business needs arise.</p>  <p>  As there was no formal applications process in 2021, no staff had had their application for blended working declined during that period. Under the Policy's application process 2022 to date, 208 officers have had their application for blended working declined based on one or more of the eligibility criteria above not being satisfied.</p></reply>

The scheme operates from June to September each year.</p><p>This year, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance payment has been increased by &euro;100 for the 2022 scheme year, building on the previously announced increase of &euro;10.

The income limits were also increased to ensure that the increases in weekly social protection payments rates introduced in Budget 2022 will not negatively impact on an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to the allowance.</p><p>Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary and operational context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements.</p><p>Applications which fall outside the normal rules of the scheme may be considered for an Additional Needs Payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme by the Community Welfare Service.  </p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an Additional Needs Payment is encouraged to contact their local Community Welfare Service.

People must have made the required number of PRSI contributions in Class A, E, H or P in order to be eligible for Illness Benefit. In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at Class S which is not counted towards eligibility for Illness Benefit.</p><p>Illness Benefit is funded by the Social Insurance Fund through the payment of Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. The Fund is central to Ireland&rsquo;s system of social protection and the Government needs to ensure that it can provide adequate and sustainable social insurance pensions and benefits for a growing and ageing population.</p><p>Self-employed people pay contributions to the Social Insurance Fund at a lower rate of 4%. People with Class S contributions, however, qualify for the following payments where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied:</p><p>- Adoptive Benefit;</p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory);</p><p>- Invalidity Pension;</p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed);</p><p>- Maternity Benefit;</p><p>- Parent's Benefit;</p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension);</p><p>- Paternity Benefit;</p><p>- State Pension (Contributory);</p><p>- Treatment Benefit; and</p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p><p>The benefits to which Class S PRSI does not provide access are Carer's Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Illness Benefit, and Occupational Injuries Benefits.</p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure. The purpose of this enhanced Illness Benefit payment is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.</p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p><p>My Department keeps its range of supports under review to ensure that they meet their overall objectives. Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  </p>  <p>  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres, including at Newbridge Intreo Centre which covers the Naas area, across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting customers in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment with a person at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home if needed.  </p>  <p>  The CWS is aware of the crucial role played by St. Vincent De Paul Society (SVP) in society and there is excellent co-operation/liaison in place with them.  There has been a series of engagements with SVP this year at both national and local levels to update that organisation on recent developments in the CWS.  The Department has provided information on the recently publicised Additional Needs Payments for the SVP&rsquo;s bulletin.  There are plans for my Department and the SVP to participate in a webinar with SVP volunteers in the coming weeks and to release a video of the webinar to their volunteer network. </p>  <p>  Following your representation, I have arranged for an official from my Department to contact the representative from SVP to discuss changes to the CWS delivery arrangements and to address the concerns raised.</p>  <p>  On a point of information, the phone number quoted in the detail of the Question is no longer in operation.  A freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS (0818 60 70 80) was launched in June this year which further enhances access to CWS nationwide.  This is a dedicated phoneline for customers located anywhere across the country seeking to get information on CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support.  </p>  <p>  Since the national phoneline commenced operation, more and more customers are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office.

These important services are delivered by the eight independent Regional Citizen Information Service (CIS) companies.  </p>  <p>  The CIB provides funding to the eight CIS companies that operate a national network of Citizens Information Centres. It is important to note that the CIB is charged with independently overseeing the delivery of the services under its remit. Similarly, each CIS is an independent limited company governed by a voluntary board of directors. These eight CIS companies make decisions independently on the delivery of services in their own regions. </p>  <p>  I understand that the CIS volunteer strategy, was developed by the independent Regional CIS Companies and is an operational matter and, as Minister, I cannot direct the CIB or the CIS companies in such matters. I have written to the CIB requesting that it provides me with information on the volunteer strategy and the implementation of the strategy by the CIS companies. I expect to receive this in the near future. </p>  <p>  The CIS is a trusted source of information, advice and advocacy, with a long tradition of volunteering and I have been assured by the CIB that the contribution of volunteers continues to be highly valued in this regard. I have been informed that CIB is urgently engaging with the regional companies to discuss the volunteer issue and how best to progress the continued return of volunteers. </p>  <p>  In addition, CIB has announced that an independent review of the volunteer programme will be undertaken as soon as possible. The review will engage with staff and volunteers of the eight CIS companies as well as their boards to review the volunteer programme and ensure that it remains fit-for-purpose and that volunteering in the Citizens Information Service companies is a rewarding role. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct limited resources in as targeted a manner as possible.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another social welfare payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income. </p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes except for Fuel Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  Incapacity Supplement is an increase payable in addition to Disablement Benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit such as Illness Benefit.  This Incapacity Supplement is a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, while Disablement Benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for Fuel Allowance because a person may continue to work or take up work, or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for Incapacity Supplement in addition to Disablement Benefit qualifies that recipient for Fuel Allowance (subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria).</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to prepare a report reviewing the treatment of Disablement Benefit under the Fuel Allowance scheme.  This report is now being finalised and the report's contents and recommendations will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The funding for the programme amounted to around &euro;16 million and was provided jointly under the European Union&rsquo;s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The Ability Programme concluded at the end of August 2021 and, in line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Final Evaluation of the Programme was published.</p>  <p>  Last year, I put a plan in place to allow for the transition of the remaining Ability providers and participants to new arrangements and this was agreed with the Ability Providers Subgroup following a meeting with this group. This included a two-month extension to the 26 organisations still operating under the programme at that time.  </p>  <p>  The current Dormant Accounts Fund Measure to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities was a new employment support measure for people with disabilities. On 30 July last year I announced that 45 projects had been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million. This programme began in September and runs up to the end of 2022. All organisations were notified of the relevant timelines in advance, and this was clearly indicated in the Call for Applications in April of last year. All 27 organisations who received funding under the former Ability Programme were successful in securing funding under this new measure, including the organisation referred to by the Deputies. </p>  <p>  It was agreed that a new employment programme for people with disabilities would be included in the new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  This new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings of the former Ability Programme. The new programme will also need to add complementarity to the suite of existing employment supports targeted at people with disabilities provided by my department and broader national strategies for employment of people with disabilities, including the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - has compiled the Operational Programme for Ireland which has been approved by Government. The Operational Programme has been formally submitted to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year.  </p>  <p>  Once approval is in place, it is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process in 2023 to applications from organisations across the country, including the organisation referred to by the Deputies, along with the other 26 former Ability Programme organisations.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputies that my commitment in relation to providing funding supports to improve the employment possibilities of people with disabilities has not been found wanting to date and that the concern raised by the Deputies is recognised.  The Deputies will understand that commitments regarding the allocation of public expenditure are subject to the overall budgetary context and will be considered in that context over the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputies at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-14a.1028.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022091400075#WRS01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 392 and 393 together.</p><p>The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents. </p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the Community Welfare Service remains a flexible service which meets the varied needs of vulnerable people and continues to provide local access to a CWO.  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.</p><p>My Department launched a freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS in June this year which further enhances access to CWS nationwide.  This is a dedicated phoneline available to people across the country to get information on CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support.  Customers can contact the phoneline at 0818 60 70 80.  </p><p>There are 16 Community Welfare Officers in County Kerry as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Kenmare </th>       <th>1 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Killarney </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Listowel </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tralee </td>       <td>10 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>16 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Department has introduced innovations this year which have increased efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the registration of claims and the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country, including Kerry, and it has been found to be very effective in releasing CWOs from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with people as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.</p><p>Claims activity in the Community Welfare Service is closely monitored at all times and changes to modernise and improve the service for clients are a feature of the service. The delivery of a locally based CWS remains and will continue to remain a cornerstone of the service.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The Early Years Division has taken responsibility for a number of actions supporting Ukrainian parents and children, allowing them to access preschool and ensuring children&rsquo;s wellbeing. These actions have included the development and translation of introductory information on the Irish early learning and care sector. A capacity analysis across the country identified vacant preschool places and work is ongoing to match children to the vacant places and to create additional early childhood care and education (ECCE) places, where possible, in areas of high demand. Information on the access and inclusion model for children with disabilities accessing preschool has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also put additional staff into its services around educational welfare too in order to support the work of linking students to school places. </p>  <p>  The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant and all Departments and agencies play a role with many of their efforts focused on meeting the welfare needs of those arriving and on their integration into communities. As a country, we have responded well to assist those relocating to Ireland from the conflict in Ukraine, and we will continue to do so working across Government, with agencies, with those in the Local Government sector and with communities.

Given the nature of the service, this will include consideration of the establishment of an independent body in the form of a new statutory agency of DCEDIY to provide the service. </p><p>A process to review timelines for implementation of the White Paper is currently underway and will take account of both the delays that have arisen as a consequence of the crisis in Ukraine and the impact of the substantial increase in the numbers seeking international protection.

The paper &ldquo;Funding the Future, an annual options paper on reducing the cost of higher education can be found here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/28c9d-funding-the-future-an-annual-options-paper-on-reducing-the-cost-of-higher-education/ </i></p><p>This paper is further step in deepening my commitment to the progressive consideration and implementation of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, within the overall context of Government policy towards costs of living and other relevant strategies including those related to access and participation in education.  </p><p>I have already taken a number of significant steps in this regard, including major changes to the SUSI student support scheme and the elimination of participation fees for PLC courses from this September.</p><p>With this in mind, it is important to highlight the very substantial financial support, currently well in excess of half a billion euro, provided by the taxpayer towards tuition fees and the student contribution for students in higher education. This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357 million per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190 million paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students. </p><p>It is important to recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education.</p><p>I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction for student and families with an increase in the funding provided by the state, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families. </p><p>My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.</p><p>As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.  Unfortunately at this time it is not possible to pre-empt the outcome or funding for student support measures in advance of Government's Budget 2023 announcement on 27 September.</p></reply>

Where students are registered with a college and withdraw after 31 October and before the end of January, colleges are entitled to claim half the fees awarded. As the student in question did not withdraw from TUD until December 2021, TUD correctly made a claim to SUSI for half the fees awarded. SUSI does not have discretion in deciding to pay fee claims made by colleges. The onus is on the student to ensure that they withdraw correctly from a course onto which they have previously registered. </p>  <p>  As things stand, this student&rsquo;s full fee grant entitlement has been paid in accordance with the registration details received by SUSI and valid fee claims submitted by both colleges on the basis of the student having registered on both courses and not formally withdrawn or deregistered within the timeframe necessary to avoid a charge becoming due.</p>  <p>If the student in question were to request that TUD backdate their withdrawal date to an earlier date prior to 31 October 2021, the student could then notify SUSI who could request a refund from TUD, and, once fees were refunded, advise Maynooth to invoice for the outstanding balance.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.

Under this legislation the institutions are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including the mode of delivery of programmes of study. HEIs have taken significant steps to ensure that teaching and learning is enhanced by the integrated use of digital technologies, both on-campus and remotely. </p>  <p>  Many HEIs are and will be developing new blended learning programmes for validation. Such programmes need to be designed, delivered and assessed within an approved quality assurance framework developed by HEIs with reference to the Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes. Programmes that are delivered partially or fully online, need to be developed with that mode of delivery in mind rather than merely being translated or transferred from the original face-to-face programme model.</p>  <p>  In 2021, key stakeholders from across the higher education sector worked collaboratively to reflect on the sudden move to online/remote learning in higher education, gather related evidence and to agree a way forward post-pandemic. Partners included the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, QQI, USI, representative bodies of HEIs, and others. The resulting report, &lsquo;Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together&rsquo; was launched in November 2021. The report includes recommendations for the sector with regard to blended/remote teaching and learning and the use of technology to ensure that higher education is as flexible, resilient and equitable as possible for all who learn, all who teach, all who support and lead, and our wider communities.</p>  <p>  In June 2022, the HEA announced &euro;37.62 million in funding for the National Technological University Transformation for Recovery and Resilience, NTUTORR, programme. The programme was informed by the Next Steps report and this funding will enable the technological sector to systematise the learnings from the experience of digitally enabled education and support the provision of digitally enhanced teaching, learning and assessment to meet the needs of staff, students, and enterprise in the regions.</p>  <p>  The fourth National Access Plan, 2022 to 2028, which launched last month, places an emphasis on student- centred goals, including flexibility. It aims to support students to study on a flexible basis including part-time and blended learning, and identify connectivity supports for remote learning. This is a seven-year plan with an additional dedicated investment of &euro;35 million over the course of the plan. </p>  <p>  Regarding student accommodation fundamentally, the challenge is one of supply of housing more generally. As a country, we know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation. That is why the Government has launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage setting out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion. Since taking up office, both my Department officials and I have engaged and continue to engage on as ongoing basis with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the wider higher education sector and relevant stakeholders on student accommodation issues including within the context of the advancement of the Government's Housing for All policy.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in June this year I met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified or be able to identify in relation to any additional student accommodation provision that may be pursued in the short to medium terms and the Department is continuing to liaise with the higher education institutions in this regard. In a welcome development, the sector indicates that hundreds of additional bed spaces have been made available by higher education institutions for the start of this academic year and NUIG will be delivering some 674 new bed spaces later next year. Subsequently in July following a case I made to the Cabinet Committee on Housing, my Department has received support to progress a new policy that bridges the challenging gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students. This could involve the State assisting with the cost of building student accommodation in return for affordability commitments on rent. Work is continuing on this policy and the Department is also ready to work with any of the new technological universities to support them to borrow to build student accommodation.</p>  <p>  On rent affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up-front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up-front each term. The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy is now no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent &ndash; that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit.</p>  <p>  Student accommodation is subject to rent pressure zone caps and students now have recourse to the Residential Tenancies Board for dispute resolution. In addition to the extra accommodation which is being put in place this year, amounting to hundreds of beds, it is also open to homeowners to rent a room to students. A homeowner can rent a room, retain their social welfare entitlements where applicable and earn up to &euro;14,000 in rental income before having to pay tax. </p>  <p>  All higher education institutions continue to support their students to find accommodation in the private rental sector through, for example, the encouragement of room rental or student digs in family homes and many also maintain online databases where students can search for and check out accommodation, advertisements for room rentals can be placed and advice on sample rental agreements provided. Institutions are actively promoting this option in their localities and I understand that there is in excess of 1,500 room rentals for students available on university databases across the country this week. </p></reply>

If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same.</p><p>Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p><p>My department provides funding for students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need, through the Student Assistance Fund (SAF).

It is worth noting that Government investment in Higher Education is not specifically allocated against a per student metric and state investment in the sector is not limited to the recurrent grant funding of institutions.</p>  <p>  Government provides financial support to the higher education sector through a number of streams including direct recurrent grants, and indirectly through a number of specific parameters including free fees, policy initiatives, competitive programme calls, Springboard+, Human Capital Initiative and SUSI fee supports. In addition institutions can receive research funding from national and international research activities. </p>  <p>  In terms of recurrent grant funding my Department allocates funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions (HEIs). The funding allocations to the HEIs, through the HEA&rsquo;s Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM), are based on a funding formula that is informed by eligible student numbers from the previous academic year. Eligible Level 9 students are included in the funding model. The annual core grant is allocated by the HEA to the higher education institutions as a block grant as a contribution towards teaching, research and supporting activities.</p>  <p>  Institutions are advised in their annual grant letter that the internal allocation of funds between teaching, research and supporting activities are a matter for each institution. Thus, there is full institutional autonomy to deploy this block grant in the most effective manner to achieve it mission across teaching, research and supporting activities. In this regard it is not possible to attribute a set amount as provided per level nine student or to level nine courses in public higher education institutions.</p>  <p>  In terms of how the RGAM utilises student numbers the HEA advise that eligible student numbers are converted to full-time equivalents (FTEs) and weighted for the relative costs pertaining to different disciplines. </p>  <p>  The three main subject price groups by which students are weighted are: Non-lab (weighting of 1), Fieldwork (1.3) and Lab (1.7) which relate to the areas of study. Under the RGAM, postgraduate Level 9 students (taught &amp;amp; research) receive additional weightings. An amount of funding is allocated on the basis of research and access measures and Level 9 students are also included in the metrics which inform these allocations.</p>  <p>  The overall funding available is divided by the total number of weighted FTE student numbers and the resulting amount per FTE is called &ldquo;standard resource&rdquo;. The standard resource is then multiplied by the number of weighted FTEs in each University and technological institution. A moderator is applied as a part of the model, to protect institutions from sudden significant fluctuations in recurrent funding.</p>  <p>  As referenced above the core grant is allocated as a single &ldquo;block&rdquo; grant to HEIs for teaching, research and supporting activities. The internal allocation of funds between teaching, research and supporting activities is a matter for each institution.</p></reply>

As apprentices are employees, the demand for and number of apprentices is primarily dictated by the employers in any area or sector.</p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners, to achieve a target of 10,000 annual registrations across a wide range of programmes by 2025.</p><p>Meeting these targets requires a responsive apprenticeship system that provides a strong value proposition for employers and potential apprentices, is attractive and easy to engage with, and that delivers high standards and sought after qualifications.</p><p>We have made important progress to date. Last year saw a record 8,607 registrations. This is an increase of nearly 40% compared to 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; year. This is a strong foundation on which to build as we advance delivery of the <i>Action Plan</i>, in order to embed apprenticeship as a preferred route to skills development.</p><p>In tandem with the impacts of Covid-19 public health measures, this growth is one of the factors impacting capacity in the training system. As a result, the number of craft apprentices waiting to progress their off-the-job training in phase 2, phase 4, and phase 6, attached in tabular form are the figures for the end of July which are the most recent available. </p><p>At the end of July there were 7464 apprentices waiting for off the job training. This month will see over 2,000 of these apprentices take up places in the coming academic term. </p><p>The number of apprentices waiting is steadily reducing from almost 12,000 in August 2021. Key is this is the continued development of apprenticeship and upskilling educational and or retraining facilities, including: </p><p>- Capital funding of &euro;20 million was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade facilities.</p><p>- Further funding of &euro;17 million has been provided to SOLAS and the HEA to address Covid-related backlogs, &euro;6 million of which is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.</p><p>- To ensure that there is capacity to meet the training needs of rapidly increasing numbers of apprentices, expansion of the apprenticeship system is continuing in 2022, with further major investment in workshops and staff is planned for this year.</p><p>Specifically, the funding includes:</p><p>- The development of two large training hubs dedicated to electrical training for the next three years;</p><p>- Expansion of electrical, plumbing, and carpentry programmes across further and higher education;</p><p>- The construction of electrical workshops at Kilkenny and Carlow ETB and the development of a training facility in Donegal;</p><p>- A call for additional phase 2 capacity in craft programmes that include carpentry, plumbing and refrigeration Expansion of electrical apprenticeships in ATU Donegal and MTU Kerry.</p><p>I am confident that these measures will contribute to the further development of the apprenticeship system, so that it continues to make a valued contribution to our skills response.</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-09-14_pq428-14-09-22_en.xlsx">Waiting List</a></p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.</p>  <p>  Section 15 of the Act sets out the statutory conditions that must be fulfilled for a certificate of naturalisation to be granted.</p>  <p>  Section 16 of the Act gives the Minister the absolute discretion to waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations (defined as related through blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen).

Blended Working is a key part of our vision to build a more dynamic, agile and responsive organisation by supporting new ways of working, in terms of where, when and how we work, while sustaining strong standards of performance and high levels of productivity.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Blended Working Policy was launched in May 2022 and the application process for blended working has been open to eligible staff since August 5, 2022. The policy indicates a minimum requirement for staff whose role has been deemed suitable for blended working, to attend at the office on 2 days per week, to ensure team connectivity and collaboration.  However, given the diverse nature of the work undertaken by my Department, the number of days that staff are required to attend the office will be dependent on the business needs of each area.</p><p>Staff of my Department have been invited to submit an application for blended working before September 23, 2022.

Some of the reasons why a role may not be deemed suitable for Blended Working include:</p> <blockquote> 	The role is 100% public facing and directly engaged in the delivery of services to our customers, and/or<br /><br />The key responsibilities and core tasks of the role involves 100% paper based processing, and/or<br /><br />The role requires access to systems that cannot be accessed remotely, and/or<br /><br />The role requires a 100% on-site presence in order to discharge the functions of the role, and/or<br /><br />Other specific tasks pertaining to the particular role that are considered by management to be not suitable for Blended Working. </blockquote>  <p>There were no formal applications for blended working in 2021 as the Department was still operating within the Covid-19 restrictions in place at that time.</p></reply>

Prior to 2012, the Irish Prison Service employed the grade of &lsquo;Nurse Officer&rsquo;.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, for both Prison Nurses and Nurse Officers, is set out in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th><b>August 2020</b></th>       <th><b>August 2021</b></th>       <th><b>Sept 6th 2022</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Prison Nurse</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nurse Officer</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>134</b></td>       <td><b>125</b></td>       <td><b>126</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that the Irish Prison Service have advised that staffing requirements are continuously monitored and that vacancies can arise as a result of multiple factors including mobility, promotions and retirements. The recruitment of Prison Nurses by the Irish Prison Service has been ongoing since 2018 and has regard to such factors as service needs and retirement levels. There were 9 nurses recruited in 2018, 19 in 2020, 6 in 2021 and 6 up to the 14 September 2022.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Prison Service continues to work to enhance and improve its level of medical service delivery to prisoners. The Service has recently concluded a comprehensive Health Needs Assessment (HNA) to examine the broad range of health care services that are provided across the entire prison estate.</p><p>In addition, the Prison Service central nursing resource is currently being strengthened and the Prison Service is progressing the appointment of a senior nursing post in Mental Health and Addiction and two additional posts relating to Clinical Professional Development and Clinical Care Pathways are also under consideration.</p></reply>

The groups are chaired by the Prison Governor and include representatives from the various services including; Prison Doctor, Psychiatry, Psychology, Chaplaincy, Probation, Education, and Prison staff. The Groups are required to meet quarterly, or more often if necessary. Their examinations fully cover the background and circumstances of each death.

It will enable people who visit Ireland regularly, for business or family reasons in particular, to make one application, which when granted, will then cover travel over a five year period. This will make travelling to Ireland a more convenient and attractive option at a time when travel worldwide is resuming and our tourism industry, in particular, is reopening following the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  Prior to this announcement, Ireland offered 1 year, 2 year and 3 year multi-entry visas, with the option of a 5 year multi-entry visa only available to Chinese passport holders (introduced in 2019). This eligibility has now been extended to all visa required countries.</p>  <p>  In general, multi entry visas are only issued to an applicant who has shown a compliant Irish travel history. People who have frequent travel to the UK, Schengen zone, USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand, and have observed the conditions of those visas will also be able to apply for the option of a multi-year visa (of any duration from 1 to 5 years), even if they have no previous Irish travel history. A multi entry visa may also be approved for some business travellers, under certain conditions, who have no previous travel history to Ireland. A multi entry visa permits the holder to travel to Ireland on a number of occasions during the dates shown on the visa. The standard single entry visa option also remains available.</p></reply>

A further 24 are currently in the final stage of processing. </p>  <p>  Regrettably, the current average processing time for naturalisation applications is approximately 19 months, however this has recently been reduced from an average of 23 months. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.</p>  <p>  My Justice Plan 2022 commits to developing a fully digital, customer-centric immigration service and to enhance the efficiency of our immigration system. In line with these commitments, a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact on immigration processing times, including the introduction of online applications, a new customer service helpdesk and a new customer-focused immigration website. </p>  <p>  As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the assignment of additional staff to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were made. This is the highest number of decisions made annually since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. </p>  <p>  For the first six months of 2022, almost 7,900 citizenship decisions have been issued, including 1,005 decisions on minor applications. This exceeds the total number of minor decisions issued during the whole of last year; when 868 minor decisions were made.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is also freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. </p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p></reply>

The NHCTP goal is to make Hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026, and in accordance with the WHO target, to eliminate it in Ireland by 2030. The NHCTP works in partnership with the Irish Prison Service nationally, and with Hospital and community teams, to provide outreach to all prisoners that require treatment for Hepatitis C. Since its inception in 2015, the NHCTP has treated over 6,600 patients with Hepatitis C virus. </p>  <p>  The NHCTP&rsquo;s Community Prescribing Project will expand in the future to be available for people not on the opioid substitution treatment scheme. An online home testing option, available later this year, will expand the testing and treatment to people who are currently undiagnosed. The NHCTP will utilise all possible treatment options and the medical needs of individuals identified will dictate which care pathway is best. Treatment will remain free to people regardless of where the service is delivered. The NHCTP will develop a communication plan to support the rollout of the home testing service.  This communication plan will also aim to destigmatise the testing and treatment associated with Hepatitis C.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with the Health Information and Quality Authority, the NHCTP is currently carrying out a national sero-prevalence study to estimate the prevalence of Hepatitis C virus infection among people in Ireland born between 1965 and 1985.</p>  <p>  The NHCTP reports that it is very much still on track to eliminate the Hepatitis C virus in Ireland by 2030. </p></reply>

I wish to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible to ensure that a robust regulatory framework for AHR is in place.</p>  <p>  The published Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. International surrogacy raises complex ethical questions concerning areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. The issues which arise from Irish people engaging in cross-border surrogacy primarily relate to parentage, guardianship, citizenship and, potentially, adoption.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy's report the Department of Justice, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and my Department are reviewing its recommendations along with other relevant matters with a view to determining an appropriate policy position. This detailed consideration is ongoing. It is important that the relevant Departments complete a robust and thorough examination of the issues, including those in the Committee&rsquo;s report, given the range of complexities involved and the rights of the various parties involved in surrogacy arrangements.  </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html.</p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 02 September, 85,012 eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 36,475 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 121,487. </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments.  </p><p>Information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>5. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE;  </p><p>6. Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </p><p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place.  </p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. Officials are continuing work to progress this large complex project, and further consideration is actively underway on how and where this would best be expedited. </p><p>I assure you that it is the intention of the Department to have all eligible healthcare workers paid without delay, and all possible efforts are being made to achieve this. I want to reassure you that the Government is prioritising this payment and remains extremely appreciative for all our healthcare workers&rsquo; efforts in the fight against Covid-19.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. The HSE Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS).</p><p>Therefore, some hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medications are available to medical card holders under the GMS scheme, subject to the statutory prescription charge.

The State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community.</p>  <p>  Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. It is acknowledged that certain rural GMS vacancies can be difficult to fill; as of last month, there were 25 GMS GP vacancies, 14 of which were in rural areas. For this reason, in addition to the more general measures taken to increase the number of GPs in the State and the significant increases in investment into general practice, specific supports are in place to support GPs in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was introduced previously to support rural GPs, these supports have been increased by 10% under the 2019 GP Agreement. In addition, practices in receipt of rural practice supports attract the maximum allowable rates for practice staff support subsidies and locum contributions for leave taking. Specific fees are also in place for dispensing doctors (who operate in rural areas), these have been increased by 28% under the Agreement.</p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  In relation to GP vacancies and retirements in Galbally and Ballylanders specifically, as this relates to a services matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the 2013 Act to have regard to a number of criteria including clinical efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines and medical items are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  Currently, Consultant Endocrinologists may apply to the HSE, on behalf of specific patients with Type 1 Diabetes, for reimbursement support of FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) sensors. The application process is undertaken by means of a dedicated online portal, which has been operational since 3 April 2018.  In line with the recommendations of the Health Technology Assessment Group, access to this product was made available to children and young adults, aged between 4 and 21 years of age. The online application process does cater for the Consultant to make an application in very exceptional circumstances for a type 1 diabetic patient who is over 21 years of age.</p>  <p>  The HSE requested that the NCPE carry out a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on Freestyle Libre, and the company, Abbott, were formally notified of this on 13 April 2021. Abbott had a scoping meeting with the NCPE in July 2021 and committed to submitting their HTA dossier by the end of October 2021. However, on 15 November 2021, Abbott informed the HSE that they would not be submitting the HTA dossier because they did not have the level of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) evidence that they stated was required for a full HTA process. Despite the HSE emphasising the importance of engaging with the HTA process to progress matters, the company have not submitted a HTA dossier to date.  It remains open to Abbott to re-engage with the NCPE as they indicated they would in July 2021. </p>  <p>  Recently, following a request from the HSE, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) held an initial meeting with the HSE Diabetes Clinical Programme to scope out what might be involved in undertaking a system wide HTA across diabetes care. In the absence of a full value assessment of the product to determine cost effectiveness or value for money, the HSE is not in a position to remove the current age restriction.</p>  <p>  During the estimates process, deliberations as to the priorities to be progressed within the National Service Plan occur. It is not possible to say at this juncture whether additional funding of the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring system will be provided.</p></reply>

I am currently working on proposals to support smaller and voluntary nursing homes in relation to the specific challenges they are experiencing and hope to make an announcement soon.</p><p>I engage consistently on an ongoing basis with Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes. I have met directly with NHI and updated them in detail on progress being made in relation to this matter.  I have also met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. I have visited a number of nursing homes to discuss this issue with management of both public and private/voluntary nursing units. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.  </p><p>Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home</p><p>-  Local market prices</p><p>-  Historic prices</p><p>-  Overall budgetary capacity</p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  The department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the NTPF pricing review, as well as taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs published last December.</p><p>I would also like to highlight the other supports provided to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, has been in place since the start of the pandemic. Over &euro;143 million has been made available to date under the scheme. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment, having been extended up to September 2022. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.  In response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations by September 2022.  </p><p>  Given the importance of nursing homes and the NHSS to the wider health and social care system - with a budget of over &euro;1 billion, and over 22,000 residents supported - it is essential that policy measures are examined with due care in order to ensure the government's objectives are delivered and avoid unintended consequences. I hope to be in a position to update sector representatives as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple. This increase helps to ensure that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the current medical card income thresholds are kept under review and any changes that may be required are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

The Government decision provides, subject at all times to the overarching eligibility criteria, that only eligible staff within the following cohorts are covered for this Pandemic Recognition Payment:</p><p>1. HSE and Section 38 organisations;</p><p>2. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>3. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>4. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>5. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>6. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE;</p><p>7. Paramedic staff employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>As such, any individual who is deemed eligible for payment a) must fit within one of the 7 cohorts highlighted above, and b) must also fit the criteria for payment, as have been set out in the eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on the HSE website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</p><p>For clarity, those who fall outside of the above are not in scope for this payment. There are many, many other individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. The Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment, but it is appropriate that those eligible frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. It was tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which eligible frontline healthcare workers faced.</p><p>I note that some private sector healthcare employers have already recognised their frontline workers for their extraordinary efforts since March 2020. The Government would encourage those other private sector healthcare employers who have not done so to adopt appropriate measures to recognise their frontline workers. </p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p>  <p>  The issue of granting medical or GP visit cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. On 1 November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card. </p>  <p>  With regard to the estimated cost of the deputy's proposals, the data required to model this is not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that it is vitally important that the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs. In that regard, my Department keeps medical card issues, including existing thresholds under review and any changes that may be required are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. Be assured, however, that I am committed to the continued enhancement of mental health services and that this will be reflected in the funding allocated for mental health in 2023. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to enhancing mental health services, is shown by significant mental health funding increases in recent years. I would note for the Deputy that 2022 saw a record budget for mental health of &euro;1.149 billion, comprising &euro;24 million for new developments, &euro;10 million for mental health initiatives in response to Covid and &euro;13 million for existing levels of service. An additional once off &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector.  </p><p>I am pleased to have secured an unprecedented level of funding, totalling, &euro;1.149 billion, for mental health in this year&rsquo;s budget. This Budget, which is the largest mental health budget in the history of the state, is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under our national mental health policy, <i>Sharing the Vision</i>, including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people.</p><p>Budget Day also saw the addition of once off &euro;10 million for mental health purposes. &euro;1m of this was provided for MyMind to continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme has been extended to those affected by the Ukrainian crisis and defective concrete blocks in Donegal and Mayo. &euro;1m was also provided to Mental Health Ireland to manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department for community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and well-being.</p><p>Funding allocated to mental health services in recent years has allowed for the continued investment in the mental health national clinical programmes and models of care, which has led to significant service improvements, including the full implementation of specialist perinatal mental health network provided for and the on-going expansion of specialist mental health teams for eating disorders, ADHD in adults, and dual diagnosis.</p><p>Importantly, as budgets increase, we need to ensure that we have plans and strategies in place so that those resources are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of people using our mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through <i>Sharing the Vision</i>in the short to longer term. <i>Sharing the Vision</i>aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030. </p></reply>

I assume the report the Deputy is referring to is the Orthodontic Lookback Review commissioned by the HSE in 2015 following receipt of a &lsquo;statement of concern&rsquo; in relation to an orthodontic service serving the Greater Dublin Area between 1999 and 2002. This review was, in effect, a scoping report commissioned to advise the HSE on what actions should be taken to determine if there was a risk of harm to patients in this case.</p>  <p>  In response to the 2015 HSE Report, the HSE commenced an audit process in 2016 to review the records of patients treated with braces in the service between 1999 and 2002. The audit phase reviewed records of over 7,500 patients of which 16 patients met the threshold for recall by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE were successful in contacting the majority of these patients and Open Disclosure meetings took place over the period from January 2020 to August 2021. The patients were offered a dental assessment as per the terms of reference and as appropriate, treatment plans were initiated in accordance with clinical need and the informed wishes of the patients. The HSE published the Report of Look-back Review into Orthodontic Services (Dublin Mid-Leinster, 1999-2002) in August 2022.</p>  <p>  Waiting lists vary regionally and according to the complexity of the condition. There are generally longer waiting lists for the least complex care. The HSE has put in place a number of measures to address waiting times in orthodontic services. These include treatment waiting list initiatives, services improvement initiatives and access to orthodontic services outside the jurisdiction. A HSE orthodontic treatment waiting list initiative in 2022 will see Children and Young People assessed as Grade 4 who have been waiting over 4 years for treatment at a cost of &euro;4.1m. So far in 2022, 884 patients have been seen under the framework.</p>  <p>  Any decision regarding publication of the HSE 2015 lookback report is a matter for the HSE.</p></reply>

One of these actions is to develop and agree a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan to support the achievement of the Government maximum wait time targets.</p>  <p>  Our immediate priority under the Action Plan during the first half of 2022 was to focus on identifying and funding additional activity to reduce the number of people waiting, with a particular focus on long waiters. The HSE and the NTPF are currently focused on delivering this additional activity.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Action Plan is being governed by a Waiting List Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and CEO of the HSE, who are meeting regularly. </p>  <p>  The focus of the Task Force for the remainder of 2022, in addition to overseeing and driving additional activity, is now turning to delivery of multi-annual waiting list reduction plan that will provide direction over the coming years to implement longer-term reform measures. Such reform measures include modernising patient care pathways to bring care closer to the community and reduce the pressure on our hospitals, and greatly enhancing the availability and analysis of waiting list data and information.</p>  <p>   The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will both positively impact the numbers of people waiting in 2022, as well as bring about real and lasting change to our waiting lists in the future by being the first year of a comprehensive and strategic multi-annual waiting list reduction and reform programme.</p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The HSE has confirmed that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </p><p>The rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 09 September, 85,078  eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 37,589  staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 122,667 .</p><p>In relation to the number of eligible HSE/Section 38 staff that are yet to be paid, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.</p><p>The HSE and the Department have been examining progressing the rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1.Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2.Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3.Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4.Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5.Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6.Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>Information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/non-Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. Once this process is published, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention.</p><p>I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases.</p></reply>

Management of the condition is required across the entire spectrum of healthcare delivery including self-management support as well as care delivered through general practice, community specialist care and hospital inpatient specialist care.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the needs of the diabetes community and the challenges faced by those living with the condition and have recently met with representatives from Diabetes Ireland and the HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes to discuss different ways diabetes care can be improved across the country.</p>  <p>  The planned delivery of diabetes services is ongoing, with increases in approved related hospital and community diabetes team posts, the increased number of DAFNE centres, and the recent Government approval for the General Scheme of a Health Information Bill, to facilitate the development of national/population-based disease specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry.  The inclusion of diabetes as one of four chronic diseases in respect of which GMS patients receive ongoing, planned care from their GP through the Chronic Disease Management Programme also represents a major step forward in assisting those living with diabetes to manage their condition.</p></reply>

Since concerns about mesh complications came to the attention of the Department of Health in late 2017, the ongoing priority focus for the Department has been to ensure that all women experiencing mesh related complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary and patient-centred care. </p><p>Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) mesh is used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women and such mesh devices have been widely used for this over the past two decades. However, in late 2017, in line with emerging international evidence, concerns were raised at national level regarding the frequency and severity of complications associated with the use of transvaginal mesh devices. The then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved.</p><p>In November 2018, the CMO&rsquo;s Report on <i>The Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures</i>was published. The Report made 19 recommendations in all, including the necessity to develop patient information and informed consent materials; surgical professional training and multi-disciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. In July 2018, the CMO had asked the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation of the implementation of specific recommendations in the CMO&rsquo;s Report. This pause remains in place.</p><p>In April 2019 the HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan to progress the recommendations detailed in this report and significant progress has been made in relation to the implementation of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on <i>The Use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures (2018)</i>and the National Women and Infants Health Programme continue to lead on this work for the HSE.</p><p>The focus for the HSE and my Department is the full implementation of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on <i>The Use of</i><i>Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures</i>and ensuring that women who require aftercare following mesh complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. Department officials continue to engage with the HSE in this regard.</p></reply>

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact. Community pharmacists have played a central role in the national vaccination rollout &ndash; the largest ever undertaken by the State.</p>  <p>  The regulations governing the pharmacy fee structure that were made under section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 expired at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations had to be replaced by 1 January 2020 in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 (Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2019 &ndash; S.I. No. 639 of 2019 &ndash; gave effect to the current pharmacy fees. Any future changes to the pharmacy fee structure will need to be made by regulations under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. The fees to be set are determined by the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. This will prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals are still impacted by operational challenges arising from the pandemic.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan  allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons in counties Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, that are on waiting lists for hip, cataract and knee surgery is outlined in the attached document. The NTPF only collects data on patients currently on the waiting list. The time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. As a result, the health system does not have the data necessary to calculate true average wait times.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </p><p>The rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.  As of Friday, 09 September, 85,078  eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 37,589 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 122,667 .</p><p>In relation to the number of eligible HSE/Section 38 staff that are yet to be paid, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.</p><p>The HSE and the Department have been examining progressing the rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1.Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2.Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3.Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4.Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5.Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6.Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>Information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/non-Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. Once this process is published, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention.</p><p>I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases. </p></reply>

Over &euro;143 million has been claimed by nursing homes under the TAPS scheme since spring 2020, and the scheme continues in effect.  Substantial additional supports have been provided by the HSE in terms of serial testing, PPE, the deployment of specialist teams and other services. Many of these supports continue.</p><p>The Department of Health acknowledges that there are variations in the cost of care across public centres as well as across private nursing homes, with public nursing homes generally having a higher cost of care to the exchequer. However, it is important to note that regardless of whether it is a private, voluntary or public nursing home, the resident's financial contribution is the same; the price of care only affects levels of state funding and has no direct impact on the resident.</p><p>Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p><p>- Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity</p><p>The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  It should also be noted that the department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the review of the NTPF pricing system published in June 2021. One of these actions relates to exploring a new geographical pricing model for the sector. </p></reply>

This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular, evidence-based review guided by relevant research, a public/stakeholder consultation, the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, including the Department of Health. Account is also taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors, such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, and their impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD announced changes in June last year to provide access to the General Employment Permit for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment in the State as a Nursing Auxiliary or Assistant (Health Care Assistant) in hospital/nursing home settings. The changes also included removing a number of healthcare occupations from the Ineligible Occupations List. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment continues to keep the employment permits system under review in light of changing labour market circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.   </p>  <p>  Processing times for all Critical Skills applications have been reduced to 3 weeks.  General Employment Permit applications for Trusted Partners (Persons who will make an offer of employment / Employers / Connected Persons and EEA contractors, who have applied for and been approved Trusted Partner status by DET&amp;E) fell from 22 weeks to 3 weeks, with Standard applications reduced to 4 weeks.  The Department aims to reduce these times yet further, on the assumption that demand remains at current levels.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from c. 11,000 in January 2022 to under 2,500 today, despite further strong growth in demand during 2022.</p></reply>

Vessels in the Rockall squid fishery could tie-up for two months at these rates.  In total, some 179 vessels availed of this scheme at a cost of &euro;10 million.</p>  <p>  I introduced a temporary tie-up scheme again in May 2022 and it will operate until November this year.  To further assist the fishing fleet in these difficult times, I am allowing each vessel to receive aid for 2 months in 2022. </p>  <p>  Already, some 67 vessel owners received aid of &euro;4.3 million for the month of June, with a further 43 vessel owners receiving aid of &euro;2.4 million for the month of July. 56 vessels tied up in August at a cost of &euro;2.8 million and 72 applications have been received for September, which will result in a further &euro;3 million in payments to vessel owners. </p>  <p>  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme operated from January to March and was availed of by 771 inshore fishing vessel owners at a cost of &euro;2.6 million. </p>  <p>  The scheme provided aid of &euro;2,700 to owners of vessels under 8 metres and &euro;4,000 to owners of vessels of 8 to 18 metres.  In addition, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme is under way and is investing &euro;600,000 in 2022 in promoting stocks of interest to inshore fishers to support prices at the quayside.</p>  <p>  Separately, a &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme is open for applications at present, with the aim of supporting the seafood processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of Brexit, and assisting the sector to move further up the supply chain to produce higher value seafood products.  Graduated grants, depending on the level of value-added, of up to 50% for capital investment are available.  </p>  <p>  For coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme is open for applications and aims to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit on businesses operating in the blue economy in our coastal regions.  The scheme offers aid of up to &euro;200,000 for capital investments and also offers aid for training and mentoring. </p>  <p>  Further support schemes are anticipated in coming months, including a voluntary decommissioning scheme for which BIM is now accepting expressions of interest.</p>  <p>  In relation to the impacts of increased energy costs arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Government is acutely conscious of the impacts across the economy.  I recognise that the seafood sector is facing particular challenges, arising from the combination of Brexit and increased energy costs. </p>  <p>  On 6th July, I  met with representatives of the fishing, aquaculture and processing sectors to discuss a number of important issues facing our seafood sector, including Brexit and increased energy costs.  The meeting gave me the opportunity to engage directly with industry representatives and to hear first-hand their concerns and priorities. </p>  <p>  I continue to engage with industry representatives on these priority matters.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value added of the project.</p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit, while also building more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. As the scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve this requires that investments are completed by 2023.</p>  <p>  Separately, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme, delivered by Bord Bia, is underway to promote sales of stocks of interest to inshore fishers, in order to boost prices at the quayside. The plan will focus on supporting the sales and promotion of inshore species such as Irish crab, lobster, whelks, inshore herring/mackerel and line caught hake and pollock on both the domestic and export markets. The 2022 marketing plan has a budget of &euro;615,000. A further recommendation of the Taskforce was the establishment of a Brexit Seafood Processing Liquidity Scheme. The recommendation is being examined in the context of State Aid Guidelines and the Brexit Adjustment Reserve Regulation.</p>  <p>  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund is now drawing to a close with only modest funds now remaining uncommitted, however the public consultation for its successor programme, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund has now concluded, with its submission to the European Commission for adoption due to take place in the coming weeks. This proposed &euro;258m programme will earmark significant funding for areas such as processing, innovation and marketing among others.</p></reply>

The Commission closed the consultation process with a stakeholder event on 10 June.</p>  <p>  The Commission has recently indicated that its report on the functioning of the CFP will take the form of a Communication, analysing the dimensions of the CFP (including governance, conservation measures, fleet management, landing obligation, data collection, control and the external dimension of the CFP).  The Commission's Communication will look at the interaction between fisheries management and the objectives of the European Green Deal.  In addition, the Communication will also address the social dimension of the CFP and consider how to improve the delivery of the CFP policy objectives.  The Commission has indicated that the results of its consultation process will be factored into the preparation of the Communication.  </p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear over the past year the Irish Government&rsquo;s assessment that the substantial changes brought about in fisheries policy as a result of the adoption of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement requires that internally within the EU, a comprehensive review be carried out of the CFP that would support changes to deliver a fair and equitable policy.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I established a national Common Fisheries Policy Review group of relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP Review, to advise me on priorities for the negotiations and to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The Group was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, and assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former Director of the MI and EPA and Mr. Donal Maguire, former Director in BIM.  The Group involved representatives of key stakeholders, including industry representative groups and the environmental NGOs.   </p>  <p>  The CFP Review Group submitted its final report to me on 29th July.  The stakeholders have set out a number of recommendations on aspects of the CFP which need to be addressed in order to adapt to the monumental changes of recent years and ensure a sustainable future for the sector.  </p>  <p>  I have forwarded a copy of the report to the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius.  I have made clear that I am fully satisfied that this report demonstrates that there is need for legislative changes in the current policy to address the disproportionate impacts of the TCA and in the context of the new environmental challenges we are all facing.   I have asked him  to review the report's findings and recommendations and consider how these can be taken forward to support a fair and balanced CFP.  I will also be bringing the report to Government for its information.</p></reply>

I am acutely aware of the emotional and financial pain associated with a TB breakdown. </p><p>Introduction of the new TB testing requirements are as result of the EU Animal Health Law Regulations 2016\429. These regulations came into effect on 1st April 2021. These new regulations require that where bovine animals are being moved from farm to farm or through marts, they must have been tested for TB within a certain time frame. </p><p>The requirements are that:</p><p>1. All Bovines that are moving farm to farm or through a mart must be tested in the previous six months,<b>and</b></p><p>2. They must also be moving from a herd that been tested in the last six months.</p><p>If they do not fulfil both of these requirements, they must be tested, either within the 30 days prior to movement or within 30 days after movement into the new herd.</p><p>These new requirements are aimed at reducing the level of transmissible disease in animals, including bovines. These requirements are directly applicable across all EU member states. As this is not a discretionary matter, my Department did not complete an analysis on competition impacts.</p><p>The Bovine TB Stakeholders Forum which comprises of representatives from across the agri-food sector, leading researchers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has agreed to the introduction of these mandatory requirements on a phased basis. These new measures should play a part in assisting the reduction of bTB in the years ahead.</p><p>Where animals that move do not satisfy the two testing-interval requirements, the initial phase of implementation will see the requirement for either pre-or post-movement test  activated in respect of cows of all ages and male animals over the age of 36 months. This first phase will come into effect on 1<sup>st</sup>February 2023. At present, no date has been set for phase two, which will see the rule applied to all animals. This will only be done in dialogue with farm organisations. </p><p>If the animal does not meet the TB testing criteria then the animal is restricted to the herd that received it and it is required to have a post movement test within 30 days,  If the animal is alive and has not tested within the 30 days then the herd is restricted and the animal must  be tested within another 30 days. If the animal is alive and has not been TB tested within another 30 days then the herd will remain restricted and the herd will be scheduled for a full herd TB test. </p><p>The responsibility to ensure that animals are tested in compliance with these requirements ultimately rests with the purchaser of the animals. </p><p>The majority of animals being moved currently satisfy these time intervals and so in such cases no additional testing will be required. </p><p>Herd owners either selling or buying animals can time their annual herd test to coincide with the sale or purchase of animals. If a herd owner wishes to re-schedule their annual herd test to an earlier date, to facilitate the sale or purchase of animals, they should contact their Regional Veterinary Office. Herd owners may test those animals that have been moved in as part of their annual herd test or as part of a Department-paid test where one is scheduled for completion, e.g., contiguous tests or post de-restriction check tests. </p><p>Discussions are currently on-going at the Financial Working Group (a TB Forum working group) about the financing of the programme overall.  Ultimately, measures to reduce the incidence of the disease will reduce the cost of the programme to farmers and tax payers.</p></reply>

There is no licence requirement if a landowner wishes to remove some of this material from a site. </p>  <p>  The Department's 'Standards for Felling and Reforestation' specifies the use of brash in creating and maintaining dense mats of brash and branch wood on all machine routes, to avoid soil damage, erosion and sedimentation.  Brash mats are typically concentrated on primary routes and in the junction of extraction paths and landing sites. </p>  <p>  Removing lop on top or brash from site is not described in the Standards for felling and reforestation. Like any non licensed activities it is important that it is done in such a way that it does not interfere with the licence conditions being met. I understand lop and top or brash is sometimes removed from sites and used as a biomass for wood fuel.  This should only be done on certain sites where the operation will not have any adverse effects on water quality. </p></reply>

International efforts must focus on the approximately 1.7 billion people across 100 economies who are severely exposed to challenging economic conditions and diminished food security, which is being exacerbated by the crisis in Ukraine. The link between hunger and conflict is well known and this is why at the UN Security Council, Ireland is playing a leading role on hunger.</p><p>In the context of our membership of the EU single market and participation in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP), the EU communication &quot;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&quot; sets out actions in the three areas of security, stability, and sustainability. </p><p>The EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers will continue to focus on these core areas and to support the work of the recently established European Food Security Crisis preparedness and response Mechanism (EFSCM). </p><p>I welcome the development of the &ldquo;EU Global Food Security Response&rdquo; adopted in the June Council Conclusions. </p><p>Its four strands of action: solidarity through emergency relief and support for affordability; boosting sustainable production, resilience and food systems transformation; facilitating Ukrainian and global trade; and effective multilateralism; form an effective framework that joins up immediate and longer term action at local and global levels. In addition, all EU Members States and the Commission have endorsed the &ldquo;Road Map for the Global Food Security - Call for Action&rdquo; agreed between Foreign Ministers at the UN, which will guide efforts led by the UN Secretary General-through the UN Global Crisis Response Group, and coordinated with the G7 Global Alliance for Food Security. </p><p>I fully support the second strand of action of the EU response, boosting sustainable production, resilience and food systems transformation. At the UN Food Systems Summit in 2021, Ireland committed to sharing its own journey in food systems transformation and its plans for the future through our national strategy Food Vision 2030, and to assist developing countries in their own journeys. In support of this, my Department has supported the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in the design of a global Food Systems Transformation Support Facility, which will be a critical component for technical support for global food systems transformation.</p><p>In Food Vision, our sector has laid out its ambition To become &ldquo;A World Leader in Sustainable Food Systems&rdquo; through the pursuit of four high-level Missions:1. A Climate Smart, Environmentally Sustainable Agri-Food Sector2. Viable and Resilient Primary Producers with Enhanced Well-Being3. Food that is Safe, Nutritious and Appealing, Trusted And Valued at Home and Abroad4. An Innovative, Competitive and Resilient Agri-Food Sector, Driven by Technology And Talent.</p><p>I am confident that the sector will deliver on its ambitions and will continue to contribute to national, EU and global food security.</p></reply>

The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.</p><p>The scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  Between 2017 and 2021, my Department allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes. These works have benefited over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p><p>I was pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year. Following a review of savings within the Department, I have recently announced an additional &euro;11 million for the scheme, so doubling the 2022 allocation to &euro;22 million.  This brings the allocation since 2017 to over &euro;100 million.</p><p>The prioritisation and selection of eligible LIS roads is a matter for each relevant local authority within broad parameters set down by my Department. Following the launch of the LIS with the confirmation of county allocations, each local authority submits a priority list of roads, as well as a reserve list to my Department before works commence locally.</p><p>541 LIS roads have been submitted and approved for funding to date for 2022, officials in my Department are engaging with a small number of local authorities to finalise lists under the second tranche of funding announced last month.  These roads together with the county allocations are set out in the following table.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Local Authority</b></th>       <th><b>Roads Submitted &amp;amp; Approved 2022</b></th>       <th><b>First Allocation </b></th>       <th><b>Second Allocation</b></th>       <th><b>Total Allocation 2022</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;592,202</td>       <td>&euro;944,082</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>&euro;371,140</td>       <td>&euro;902,317</td>       <td>&euro;1,273,457</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>&euro;582,690</td>       <td>&euro;655,325</td>       <td>&euro;1,238,015</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>&euro;879,099</td>       <td>&euro;419,141</td>       <td>&euro;1,298,240</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>&euro;716,560</td>       <td>&euro;994,654</td>       <td>&euro;1,711,214</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>&euro;958,831</td>       <td>&euro;724,010</td>       <td>&euro;1,682,841</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>&euro;704,030</td>       <td>&euro;791,460</td>       <td>&euro;1,495,490</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;83,446</td>       <td>&euro;435,326</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>&euro;390,790</td>       <td>&euro;237,820</td>       <td>&euro;628,610</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;508,397</td>       <td>&euro;860,277</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;729,158</td>       <td>&euro;1,081,038</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>&euro;485,970</td>       <td>&euro;445,019</td>       <td>&euro;930,989</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;114,060</td>       <td>&euro;465,940</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;96,393</td>       <td>&euro;448,273</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;610,944</td>       <td>&euro;610,944</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>&euro;340,500</td>       <td>&euro;228,799</td>       <td>&euro;569,299</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>       <td>&euro;581,009</td>       <td>&euro;932,889</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>&euro;380,760</td>       <td>&euro;294,025</td>       <td>&euro;674,785</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>&euro;456,990</td>       <td>&euro;114,768</td>       <td>&euro;571,758</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>&euro;358,030</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;358,030</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>&euro;644,070</td>       <td>&euro;481,703</td>       <td>&euro;1,125,773</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>&euro;92,910</td>       <td>&euro;494,266</td>       <td>&euro;587,176</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>&euro;358,320</td>       <td>&euro;298,461</td>       <td>&euro;656,781</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>&euro;431,760</td>       <td>&euro;349,267</td>       <td>&euro;781,027</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>&euro;384,390</td>       <td>&euro;253,358</td>       <td>&euro;637,748</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Roads</td>       <td>541</td>       <td>&euro;11M</td>       <td>&euro;11M</td>       <td>&euro;22M</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

They receive funding from the Department of Rural and Community Development and Local Authorities to resource their own core activities related to their functions; namely, local policy representation, building the capacity of volunteer-run groups to contribute to local policy, and providing information and networking opportunities to community groups. The funding is not intended for other purposes.</p>  <p>  The &euro;9m Community Activities Fund, which I launched in November 2021,  allowed groups in disadvantaged areas to apply for funding for their running costs such as utility (Electricity, Heating charges) or insurance bills.  Groups could also apply for funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment within their community. This scheme is part of the CEP and is administered by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs). The Community Activities Fund is now closed to applicants.

The current iteration began on 1 January 2018 and will run until the end of 2023.  My Department has committed over &euro;250 million funding to the six year national programme. </p><p>The funding for SICAP is subject to the annual budgetary estimates process. It should be noted that increases in the annual allocations have been achieved over the duration of the current programme and I was delighted to have secured a 10% increase for SICAP for 2022, the largest increase since the programme was launched. This year, over &euro;43 million was allocated to the programme, supporting front line workers in Local Development Companies to deliver SICAP on the ground.</p><p>Earlier this year, an additional &euro;5 million funding was announced to support the Local Development Companies, through SICAP, for the community response to support people arriving from Ukraine.</p><p>While funding for SICAP was reduced after 2008, it should be noted however that since then other social inclusion measures have been initiated and funded.  I recognise the vital work that the programme<b></b>does in helping so many individuals and groups, by improving the life chances of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or unemployed, and I will continue to prioritise funding for SICAP within my Department&rsquo;s overall voted expenditure.</p></reply>

To date, 191 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;279 million for projects costing &euro;379 million.</p><p>Calls for applications to the Fund are sought under two categories &ndash; Category 1 and Category 2. Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place, and which are ready to proceed. Category 2 provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for Category 1 applications.</p><p>The fourth call for Category 1 applications to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed on the 29<sup>th</sup>April 2022.  My Department received 42 applications to this call, together seeking funding of over &euro;149 million. I understand that an application was received for the project referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The application process for the Fund is competitive in nature. Applications are currently being assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts.  Once the assessment process is complete, my Department will prepare a report setting out recommended projects. My role as Minister will be to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding.  </p><p>I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>
