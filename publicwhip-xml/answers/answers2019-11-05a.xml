    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500060#WRB00500"><p>The need for more active land management by the State has been articulated in many policy documents, including report No.145 of the National Economic and Social Council which stated that Project Ireland 2040: the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the National Development Plan (NDP) provided the perfect moment to transition to a new system of urban development and land management. This is crucial in ensuring that future developments are planning led rather than developer led.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency (LDA) is being established in this context with an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, bringing essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market. </p>  <p>  The LDA is the State's developer. The proposed primary legislation will establish the LDA  as a commercial State body with the capacity and mandate to fulfil this important public purpose.  The shareholders will be the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself.  The LDA cannot be privatised as the proposed legislation will provide that the shareholding in the LDA can only be held by a Government Minister or a body under their aegis. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government  agreed that new requirements will attach to the disposal of surplus State lands, in that , where appropriate, a minimum of 30% of residential units should be affordable housing, in addition to statutory requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts.  This is a matter of Government policy,  which applies to public lands provided to the LDA.  The LDA will be accountable to the Government for the delivery of such housing in line with its mandate. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500060#WRB00800"><p>Funding approval was given to Cavan County Council earlier this year under the voids programme, based on the number of properties submitted by them at that time.  In recent weeks, the Council has submitted substantially more properties for inclusion under the programme and funding approval has now issued in response to that second proposal.   </p>  <p>  While my Department is supportive of Cavan County Council in bringing vacant social homes back to productive use under the voids programme, I am advised that the increased level of submissions being made by the Council, arises from a reduced funding commitment on their part, to the maintenance of their own housing stock. The management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under the Housing Acts.  To facilitate the early re-letting of social homes when an existing tenant leaves a property, it is vital that local authorities make provision in their own budget, for pre-letting works. Indeed, the support of Councillors to make adequate budgetary provision for this important work is a key element in ensuring that local authorities can re-let social homes as soon as possible to those on their waiting lists.</p></reply>

This will be achieved through blended delivery, involving increasing the social housing stock by 50,000 homes, through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and supporting some 88,000 further households through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  Of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland,  over 10,000 homes will be leased by local authorities and approved housing bodies under leasing arrangements from a range of different sources, including direct leasing by local authorities and approved housing bodies, the Repair and Leasing Scheme, the Mortgage to Rent Scheme and Enhanced Leasing.  The exact blend of delivery under leasing in any given year will depend on the availability of existing stock and new homes in any particular county. </p>  <p>  A total of 2,130 dwellings are targeted to be delivered under leasing in 2019; the target increases to 2,631 dwellings in 2020 and is set at 2,450 dwellings in 2021. It should be noted that progress by each local authority against target under Rebuilding Ireland is published quarterly on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  Leasing is funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), which also meets the current costs of dwellings delivered by approved housing bodies under the CALF and Housing Agency Acquisitions Programmes. The SHCEP budget for 2019 is just under &euro;155 million. An allocation of &euro;191 million has been secured for SHCEP in 2020, which is an increase of &euro;36 million on the 2019 allocation. The allocation for SHCEP in 2021 will form part of the annual estimates process.</p></reply>

The Report of the Task Force which is available on my Department's website, was brought to Government in May 2018. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Report, which  included a review of fire safety in 839 buildings over 6 storeys, found that the combination of factors that contributed to the Grenfell Tower fire do not seem to be present in Ireland and that the current fire safety strategy in Ireland, which includes evacuation, is appropriate and effective in protecting people living in medium to high-rise buildings.   </p>  <p>  The Report did, however, make a range of recommendations for improvements in relation to fire safety and work is underway in terms of: regulatory provisions; fire service operations and fire safety, particularly around fire detection and alarm systems.   </p>  <p>  I have now asked my Department to review the Report on Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, which was recently published and to bring forward any additional recommendations as appropriate. </p>  <p>  In relation to Building Regulations, work has been on-going to review &ldquo;Part B: Fire Safety - Volume 2&rdquo; and a new Technical Guidance Document came into force on 1 July 2017. A revised Volume 1, is being prepared for public consultation at present.  </p>  <p>  In terms of equipment, this is  generally a matter for fire authorities based on their assessment of fire risk and requirements. However, to support authorities in procuring specialist equipment, as part of my Department's capital programme, Dublin Fire Service has recently received approval to purchase a 42-metre Turn Table Ladder (TTL) and Cork City Fire Service has been approved to purchase a 32-metre Hydraulic Platform. </p></reply>

The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities on a regional basis and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System.  The report captures details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.  The most recent report is for September 2019, which showed that there were 6,524 adults and 3,873 dependants in emergency accommodation in that month.  Monthly reports for 2016, 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Supporting families experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this year&rsquo;s budget. While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  In the first six months of 2019, 2,825 adults and their associated dependents exited homelessness into homes nationally.  This is a 21% increase on the numbers recorded at the same point in 2018.  In the Dublin region, data provided by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive shows that 786 families have exited from emergency accommodation into homes over the first nine months of this year.  This is a 48% increase on the exits achieved over the same period last year.  Family presentations in the Dublin region have also fallen by 9.5% in the first nine months of the year, compared to 2018, with 48% of the families presenting to homeless services prevented from having to enter emergency accommodation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500060#WRB02100"><p>HAP plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals.  At the end of Q2 2019, there were more than 48,000 households in receipt of HAP support and over 28,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland sets annual national targets for additional HAP-supported tenancies. In 2018, this target was for an additional 17,000 HAP tenancies, which was exceed by more than 900 tenancies. A target was set to support an additional 16,760 households through HAP in 2019; at the end of Q2 2019 an additional 8,667 HAP tenancies were set up. </p>  <p>  The HAP Placefinder, an initiative started in Dublin and Cork to provide targeted assistance to homeless households, was rolled out nationally in January 2018. This structure provides local authorities with enhanced resources, both staffing and financial, to directly assist households to secure HAP properties, including as appropriate- working in emergency accommodation to assist families exit to HAP; liaising with agents and property owners; attending viewings; paying deposits and advance rent as needed. Over 8,100 households who were either homeless or at urgent risk of homelessness have been assisted under the service to date.</p>  <p>  A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient. However, on 1 January 2016, the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced &ldquo;housing assistance&rdquo; as a new discriminatory ground. This means that discrimination in the provision of accommodation or related service and amenities against people in receipt of rent supplement, HAP or other social welfare payments is prohibited. </p>  <p>  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the Workplace Relations Commission. </p></reply>

However, prior to the making of such an order, and not later than 30 October 2019,  the Act requires that I review the operation and effectiveness of the SHD arrangements and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report of my conclusions of the review.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a Strategic Housing Development Review Group was established in June 2019. The Report of the Review Group was received on 24 September 2019.  The Report acknowledges that the SHD arrangements have generally been a success in meeting their objectives to contribute to addressing housing undersupply issues by providing a fast-track development consent process aimed at incentivising developers to bring forward applications for large-scale housing developments. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive contribution the SHD arrangements have made, the Review Group notes that there continues to exist a deficit in housing supply and affirms that the original rationale for the introduction of the SHD arrangements remains. In light of these findings, the Review Group considers that there are sufficient grounds for extending the SHD arrangements until the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  I concur with the finding of the Review Group in this regard and propose to shortly sign an order to this effect. A report on my conclusions of the review, as well as the Review Group's Report, has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by the Act and copies of both reports are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have reflected on the views of the Review Group on the rate of activation of SHD sites, and  I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner given the benefits the SHD arrangements provide.  Therefore, I consider that it would be appropriate to introduce  a "use it or lose it" measure in this regard and I intend bringing forward the necessary legislation to address this matter.</p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Lead indicators for housing supply, such as planning permission and construction commencement activity, provide a strong basis for confidence that the number of new home completions will continue to increase.</p>  <p>  Aside from encouraging greater supply, my Department has deployed a range of measures to help address affordability.  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a targeted support to help first time buyers to attain homeownership.  Total funding available for the loan is over &euro;563m for 2018 and 2019 combined.  This measure complements the Help to Buy scheme, which helps first time buyers saving for a deposit.  The designation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), helps to constrain price inflation in many residential rental markets. There are now 44 RPZs across Ireland, covering 68% of all registered tenancies.  Other supports, such as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), will support the provision of new affordable homes for purchase and rent.  </p>  <p>   My Department, working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, operates a housing economics research programme which examines the various dynamics of housing and rental markets. Recent research under this programme in relation to affordability was published in the Spring 2019 edition of the Economic and Social Review. </p>  <p>  A further paper examining affordability for prospective first-time buyers from a regional perspective is currently being finalised and will be published in due course.</p></reply>

By 2021, the social housing stock in Ireland will have increased by 50,000 homes. This will be achieved using a combination of build, acquisition and leasing programmes.  This will further contribute to the ongoing reduction in housing waiting lists. </p><p>Spending on the capital housing programme has been increasing significantly year on year under Rebuilding Ireland and this year more than 10,000 new social homes will be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes across the country. Next year this figure will increase to more than 11,000 new social homes. </p><p>While this capacity grows, it is imperative that we also support families using current programmes such as HAP and RAS. </p><p>The table below outlines the expenditure on current expenditure programmes such as SHCEP, RAS and HAP over the period 2016 &ndash; 2018. In 2019, more than &euro;2.4 billion will be expended across both capital and current programmes meeting the housing needs of more than 27,000 households.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2016 Expenditure </th>       <th>2017 Expenditure </th>       <th>2018 Expenditure </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>       <td>&euro;m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SHCEP </td>       <td>54.029 </td>       <td>84.051 </td>       <td>100.393 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>RAS </td>       <td>130.998 </td>       <td>142.838 </td>       <td>143.337 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>HAP </td>       <td>57.7 </td>       <td>152.697 </td>       <td>276.604 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>242.727 </td>       <td>379.586 </td>       <td>520.334  </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Over the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 90,000 households were supported under current programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. If the funding provided for these 90,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Looking at it another way, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new build local authority home for those 90,000 households. </p><p>The review of Current and Capital Expenditure on Social Housing Delivery Mechanisms, prepared by the Irish Government Economic &amp;amp; Evaluation Service (IGEES) and published earlier this summer, focussed on an examination of the housing supports provided through capital and current funding mechanisms, the trends and cost developments in housing expenditure and also considered broader issues relevant to overall housing policy development.</p><p>In examining the overall blend of housing delivery mechanisms, the review recognised that, in addition to cost factors, there are a range of other factors, which need to be considered in terms of housing delivery, including flexibility and speed of delivery to meet immediate housing need. </p><p>Addressing increased social housing need and delivering the greatest number of social housing supports at this time has required the development and implementation of a range of flexible and innovative mechanisms, which take account of available resources and market conditions.  Harnessing private investment remains an important element in the overall delivery of social housing, including through supporting local authorities in meeting the needs of households on their waiting lists.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the cost comparisons set out in the review, it remains the case that it would not be possible to deliver the same number of social housing homes in higher value rental areas exclusively through capital funded build and acquisition programmes.  This will continue to be an important consideration in the context of the future availability of capital funding and the resourcing and capacity required to escalate local authority build and acquisition programmes to the level required to meet the current level of social housing need. </p><p>Indeed of the 50,000 new social housing homes which will be added through Rebuilding Ireland, 33,500 of these will be built with the remainder acquired. A further 10,000 homes will be leased under long term leasing arrangements. </p><p>Clearly, it is important at this time that a blended approach to the delivery of social housing homes is pursued in order to deliver and provide immediate housing supports to those households on local authority waiting lists across the country whilst simultaneously ratcheting up capacity year on year within the housing stock. This approach is supported by the findings of the IGEES review, which supports the need for a blended approach to delivery. </p><p>The housing crisis is complex in nature and requires a flexible, innovative response. In each year of Rebuilding Ireland to date outputs have exceeded targets and in doing so we are, step by step, resolving these issues and putting in foundations of a sustainable housing future for this country. </p></reply>

However, as the Deputy is well aware, responsibility for tourism rests with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  My responsibility insofar as housing and planning matters are concerned is to ensure that our housing stock is used in the most appropriate manner.</p><p>New planning legislative reforms to regulate the short term letting sector - as provided for in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 and supplementary regulations which I made entitled the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 - came into effect on 1 July 2019. </p><p>The primary objective of the legislative changes is aimed at regulating short-term letting through the planning code in the context of its impact on the supply of private rented accommodation particularly in urban centres of high housing demand i.e. rent pressure zones. The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms.  It is worth pointing out that these new planning laws go further than what was proposed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government when it considered this matter.  In fact, they go further than similar laws in most comparable jurisdictions.</p><p>The broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing/ registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents - as recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term lettings - is beyond the scope of the planning code and my remit.  However, I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, outlining the recommendations made by the Working Group and highlighting the measures taken by my Department to act upon these recommendations, specifically the introduction of the short-term letting legislation. I advised the Minister that the remaining recommendations of the Working Group fell under the remit of his Department to action, and assured him of my support, and that of my Department, in addressing these outstanding recommendations.</p><p>The new planning related arrangements in relation to short-term letting are in their early stages, having only commenced with effect from 1 July last. It is expected that the level of registrations of home-sharing activity will increase over the coming months as word of the new arrangements spreads and as local authority enforcement of the arrangements is stepped up. </p><p>Further detailed information on the new arrangements can be obtained at the following weblink:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The legislative framework comprises the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, (the Act) and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended.  </p>  <p>  With regards to policy guidance, my Department has issued a large number of planning guidelines (available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.housing.gov.ie) under section 28 of the Act, to which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their planning functions.  My Department also issued a Planning Enforcement Policy Directive in 2013 under section 29 of the Act reminding planning authorities of the critical importance of planning enforcement and the need to assign sufficient and appropriate human resources for this purpose. The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities.  </p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of planning control is a matter for the relevant planning authority which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met.  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. </p>  <p>  There are extensive enforcement provisions provided for in Part VIII of the Act, with a view to ensuring that works pertaining to permitted developments are carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted and any associated conditions and that no unauthorised development takes place. If a person is of the view that any development works being undertaken are not in compliance with the permission granted - including any violations of hours of work or related matters specified in a condition attached to a permission - or are unauthorised, s/he may make a written complaint to the relevant planning authority who shall investigate the matter and take any appropriate enforcement action. This includes the issuing of a warning letter and, where necessary, an enforcement notice requiring that the development is carried out in conformity with the planning permission and any condition pertaining to that permission.  </p>  <p>  If an enforcement notice is not complied with, the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a Court order under section 160 of the Act, requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that planning authorities have sufficient enforcement powers at their disposal under the existing legislation. Further to the Policy Directive referred to, it is a matter for planning authorities to ensure that they assign appropriate resources for effective planning enforcement. </p></reply>

The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities on a regional basis and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The report captures details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.  The most recent report is for September 2019 which showed that there were 1,756 families with 3,873 associated dependants in emergency accommodation in that month.  </p>  <p>  Supporting families experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Rebuilding Ireland is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively. Over 27,000 households had their housing need met under Rebuilding Ireland in 2018, with the local authority stock of social housing increased by 8,000, including homes built by local authorities and by Approved Housing Bodies. In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this year&rsquo;s budget. While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  </p>  <p>  This funding also supports the delivery of services to prevent families having to enter emergency accommodation and to ensure that those families in emergency accommodation are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy within the shortest possible time frame.  The HAP Placefinder service has been made available to all local authorities to support households experiencing homelessness or at risk if entering into homelessness, to identify and secure a tenancy in the private rented sector. My Department has approved funding for 23 Placefinder officers nationally. </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  I expect that the numbers of exits from homelessness will increase again in 2019.</p>  <p>  Further work is being done to prevent families from presenting to homeless services.  To strengthen further the rights of tenants in the private rented sector, building on initiatives already taken, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 was signed into law in May 2019.  Among the key provisions of the Bill are measures to empower the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs); the creation of criminal offences for landlords connected with non-compliance with rent increase restrictions in RPZs; and increasing notice periods for tenancy terminations by landlords. In addition, there are now Rent Pressure Zones in 42 areas nationally, in which rent increases are limited to 4 % p.a., and the operation of which has been strengthened further under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.</p></reply>

This follows on from the amendments introduced by the Central Bank to the regulatory regime within which Credit Unions operate. </p>  <p>  Along with my colleague, Minister English, and officials from my Department and the Department of Finance, I have met with the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) to examine how their sector can assist in the area of financing social housing delivery. Minister English met with CUDA as recently as 23 October 2019.  </p>  <p>  Throughout the discussions with the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies, my Department has emphasised that while it has provided technical assistance regarding the mechanisms for funding social housing, it is a matter for the Credit Unions themselves to set up special purpose vehicles to enable them to invest in the sector. </p>  <p>  For this reason, my Department referred the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes. The work of this group was supported by grant funding from my Department. </p>  <p>  In parallel with the work undertaken by this group, the ICSH along with six Tier 3 AHBs have worked with financial advisors to establish a funding mechanism/vehicle which would identify suitable sources of non-state finance which could fund the delivery of social housing by AHBs. To date market testing has revealed good interest in lending to the sector from various lenders including Banks, Institutional investors and the Credit Union sector. This work has involved seeking sources of lending based on best value for money. </p>  <p>  To date, one AHB has set up a special purpose vehicle; two AHBs have sourced private finance from a private institution and two AHBs are currently examining the possibility of establishing a structure to work collectively.  </p>  <p>  The Credit Union sector is one potential funder whose terms are assessed as part of the process of market testing to establish best value for money and optimum terms and conditions from lenders.

This flexible and responsive approach is the hallmark of Rebuilding Ireland and it is working. </p>  <p>  This year we will deliver more than 10,000 new social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing mechanisms across the country. Next year this figure will be in excess of 11,000. To put this into context, this would represent an almost 100% increase on the delivery of social homes in just four years, compared with the delivery of 5,714 homes through the same mechanisms in 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's National Development Plan 2018-2027, sets out the Government's  commitment to deliver 112,000 social housing homes out to 2027, supported by capital funding of &euro;11.6 billion. </p>  <p>  This progress is having a tangible affect on the lives of thousands of households and the most recently available Summary of Social Housing Assessments indicated that the number of households on the social housing waiting list has decreased by 25%.   </p>  <p>  However, we must also ensure that we meet the housing needs of families and individuals in the short term. At the end of Quarter 2 of 2019, almost sixty thousand households (59,961) have been supported through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme since the start of Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  These supports are vital and provide security to households and enables them to remain in their homes, under the rights afforded by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), until such time as they move onto either a social home with a local authority or Approved Housing Body or alternatively into the private market, facilitated by additional measures, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have helped address the housing needs of some 15,000 households.</p>  <p>  The provision of affordable housing, either to buy or rent, is being facilitated by the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) that runs from 2019 to 2021. The fund is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable discounted homes can be delivered and I envisage that at least 6,200 affordable homes can be provided through this mechanism. Approval in principle has been granted for funding of approximately &euro;127 million, to support almost 3,200 homes.  While more focused on urban areas, and building at scale on local authority sites, the fund remains in place for the provision of housing in all locations where there is a proven affordability challenge.  It is anticipated that further calls under the Serviced Sites Fund will be made in due course.</p>  <p>  Lastly, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) was designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand. Funding of &euro;200 million was originally made available under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million would be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities to match fund &euro;50 million. 30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance. These projects will stimulate development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities and approximately 7,800 of these homes will be offered a discount on open market prices. To date, according to information provided by Local Authorities, 1,678 housing units have been delivered including 785 cost reduced units.</p></reply>

In August 2017, I requested all local authorities to designate vacant home officers to co-ordinate local actions to address vacancy and also to undertake local vacancy surveys in order to identify, through their Vacant Homes Action Plans, priority "vacancy hot-spot areas" and properties that can be quickly brought back into residential use. </p>  <p>  Where local authorities identify a potentially long term vacant residential dwelling, and the owner can be identified, the local authority attempts to engage with the owner on the options available to assist in bringing their properties back into use as liveable housing stock. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland, in the region of 553 vacant homes have been re-introduced to the liveable housing stock, primarily through our Repair and Lease, and Buy and Renew initiatives.  Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties. These recovered properties aid us in the ongoing effort to meet our commitments under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a range of measures that try to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  In order to more accurately determine the levels of long-term, vacant but recoverable dwellings that can be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock, the Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the CSO and the local government sector, developed a survey methodology in relation to locating vacant housing and a pilot field-based survey was undertaken across six local authorities. </p>  <p>  Each participating local authority visually inspected  approximately 1,200 homes, recording the location of potentially vacant properties and, where possible, recording apparent reasons for vacancy and categorising each vacant home (with a view to prioritising those which are most likely to be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock). To identify long-term vacancy, the pilot requires two visual inspections, six months apart, with those houses occupied between the two inspections disregarded. </p>  <p>  The participating local authorities have completed their work on the pilot vacancy identification survey and my Department is analysing the results of the survey and considering the outcomes to determine whether there would be significant value in rolling out the survey on a national basis. </p>  <p>  I believe that the co-ordinated work of the Vacant Homes Unit in my Department and the local authority Vacant Homes Offices has been and continues to be instrumental in acting as a vital source of information and advice to those who may own homes that are suitable for reactivation. This ongoing liaison between the Department and local authorities, who have crucial local knowledge, allows for more rapid action to tackle vacancy and also provides a clear repository at the coalface for owners of vacant homes who want to bring them back into use.</p></reply>

As part of this process, my Department is also liaising with the Department of Finance and the CSO to ensure any new or additional information can be brought forward for consideration. </p></reply>

Indeed, this year more than 10,000 new social housing homes will be delivered through these methods and my Department are working very closely with all stakeholders to monitor progress and maximize the delivery of all new social housing homes, including the targeted 6,545 build social housing homes in 2019. </p><p>It should be noted that the social housing targets, agreed with each local authority for 2019, have been  published on my Department's website at (). </p><p>Throughout the year, communication and meetings take place between my Department and senior management at each local authority to resolve blockages and identify opportunities to deliver the maximum amount of homes possible each year.

The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and making significant progress. </p>  <p>  Annual delivery targets were exceeded in 2017 and again in 2018. By end Quarter 2 2019, over 84,000 additional social housing homes had already been provided under the plan. </p>  <p>  The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 25% nationally, from 91,600 households to just over 68,000 between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Substantial funding is in place to deliver on the targets set in Rebuilding Ireland. The Housing Budget for 2019 is &euro;2.4 billion rising to &euro;2.63 billion in 2020, representing an increase of &euro;258 million (+11%) compared to 2019.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage very intensively with all local authorities to keep momentum on new build output as high as possible. When we examine the pipeline for new development, there are reasons to be optimistic in terms of meeting our ambitious delivery plans for 2019 and beyond. The Construction Status Report covering the period to June 2019 shows that there are now over 22,000 homes in the build pipeline, up more than 8% on quarter 1 of this year. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the number of homes on site at the end of June 2019 was 6,439. Given the healthy pipeline and expected delivery profile over the coming two quarters, I am confident that we are on track to meet our targets.</p>  <p>  In order to support housing authorities deliver on their responsibilities and obligations, a number of dedicated structures have been put in place across the country over the last number of years.  </p>  <p>  A dedicated Housing Delivery Office (HDO) was also established within my Department in September 2017 to support local authorities, approved housing bodies and all stakeholders involved in the delivery of key elements of the ambitious private and social housing targets in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. The purpose of this office is to accelerate and monitor housing delivery, both private and social, on key sites, identify further mechanisms to accelerate delivery, and support the roll-out of complex construction projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery.</p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency (LDA) was also established in September 2018 with an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. On establishment, the Agency had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites  that have near term delivery potential for 3,000 new homes. The overall objective is for the LDA to be involved in the building of 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. </p>  <p>  Extensive consultation has taken place and is ongoing between the Land Development Agency (LDA) and local authorities. The discussions have centred around how the LDA can assist with the formulation of plans to deliver housing, including social and affordable housing, on local authority owned lands.  It is also working with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in relation to the delivery of housing on the local authority owned site at Shanganagh.</p>  <p>  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are vital for successful delivery of social housing targets and my Department works closely with these bodies on an ongoing basis to support them in the delivery of their social housing programme. The AHB Service Unit was also established within the Housing Agency to provide a centre of excellence and advice for AHBs. This Unit works with local authorities and AHBs to build their capacity and expertise to meet the scale and complexity associated with the ambitious programme of delivery in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  I believe what is critical at this stage is to ensure that all of the structures already in place are aligned, co-ordinated and co-operating towards a shared vision. This includes my own Department, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency working with local authorities and approved housing bodies across the country. I am satisfied at this time that appropriate arrangements are in place to deliver much needed social and affordable homes across the country. </p></reply>

This is in addition to supporting 88,000 new families and individuals into homes through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes. </p>  <p>  In terms of social housing, the priority in Rebuilding Ireland is to target the delivery of as many social housing homes, as quickly as possible, utilising all the programmes and mechanisms available.  This year, &euro;2.4 billion will support the delivery of 10,000 social housing homes and this will increase again in 2020, when over &euro;2.6 billion will support the delivery of over 11,000 homes to the social housing stock. </p>  <p>  The rapid delivery programme is one of a suite of delivery programmes and measures in place to support the delivery of social housing homes across the country.  At end 2018, 423 social housing homes had been delivered utilising the rapid delivery programme. 22 of these were delivered in 2016, 186 in 2017 and 215 in 2018. A further 215 new social housing homes are expected to be delivered through the rapid delivery programme in 2019.  It should be noted that there are now 40 rapid build projects in the pipeline that will deliver some 1,100 homes out to 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with all local authorities in relation to increasing and accelerating the delivery of rapid build methodologies. To support rapid delivery housing, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of Rapid Delivery contractors in 2017. This framework is available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to use in the interest of accelerated delivery. </p>  <p>  We have also been working specifically with Dublin City Council on the establishment of a Design Build Contractor Framework to deliver apartments.  This framework, which was established recently, has a value of &euro;750 million. It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track apartments will be built using this framework, and while the majority of these homes will be advanced across the Dublin area, we are working with other local authorities to advance schemes/projects suitable for volumetric construction. </p>  <p>  While the rapid delivery programme represents new challenges to local authorities in relation to forms of contract, design and contract management, the pipeline of rapid delivery projects is continuously strengthening; with more local authorities adopting it as a means of delivery. My Department will continue to encourage, work with and support local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies deliver as many homes utilising this mechanism as possible. </p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to provide homes on publicly owned land and the suitability of rapid delivery programme is considered for all social housing projects.  Regarding the use public land in general, extensive consultation has taken place and is ongoing between the Land Development Agency (LDA) and local authorities. The discussions have centred around how the LDA can assist with the formulation of plans to deliver housing, including social and affordable housing, on local authority owned lands.</p></reply>

As outlined in the table, while the overall numbers have declined the profile of the posts has changed somewhat to reflect the evolving policy based issues for the defence sector, both national and international, increased activity in areas such as HR and procurement, governance and supporting engagement with the Oireachtas. In addition, the transfer of a number of transactional HR and payroll functions, involving predominantly clerical grades, to the National Shared Services Office has also impacted on the required skills and workforce profile of my Department.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department comprises of both a civil and a military element. The civil element is headed by the Secretary General and the military element by the Chief of Staff. Both elements provide support to me as Minister in the management of defence. Defence Forces' Headquarters is the military element of the Department, with an establishment of over 320 military personnel.  </p><p>Civil-military collaboration in the Department enables the delivery of defence across the three strategic dimensions set out in the Statement of Strategy; defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and Defence Forces' operational outputs. Also, the White Paper on Defence, which provides the policy framework for defence to 2025, is being implemented through a project management framework built on civil-military collaboration.  A number of additional civil servants have been assigned directly to work within military units to provide specialist skills and expertise in key areas such as finance, procurement and analysis.</p><p>In addition, the Department of Defence continues to play an important role in the areas of Civil Defence, Emergency Planning, enterprise development and societal supports and I am satisfied that the appropriate resources are in place to discharge the functions of my Department.</p><p><b>Staff numbers in the Department of Defence</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>GRADE </th>

A no deal outcome is in no one&rsquo;s interests. Once the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the provisions in respect of citizens&rsquo; rights, financial obligations and the protocol on Northern Ireland remain in place even if no agreement on a future relationship is reached by the end of the transition period. </p><p>The shared intention of the EU and the UK, as set out in the Political Declaration on the future relationship, is to conclude agreements giving effect to the future relationship by the end of 2020, including an ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced economic partnership.  The EU is ready to start negotiations on a future relationship as soon as the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified.  </p><p>While the goal is to conclude a future relationship agreement by the end of 2020, the Withdrawal Agreement provides that the transition period may be extended by one or two years.  Such a decision must be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.  At the same time, it should also be noted that the Political Declaration states that the European Commission is ready to propose applying on a provisional basis relevant aspects of the future relationship, in line with the applicable legal framework.</p><p>We continue work to prepare for Brexit.

Ireland works through the World Health Organisation, with organisations such the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria and with civil society partners to ensure access to essential drugs, health services, and best practice, including building more effective health workforces, with an emphasis on better health outcomes for women and children.  Ireland recognises that quality health systems must include access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services if women's health outcomes are to be transformed, including reducing maternal and child mortality.</p><p>This is acknowledged in the Sustainable Development Goals: if the ambition of the SDGs is to be achieved, there must be a continued reduction in the millions of women at risk each year of dying from complications in pregnancy and childbirth.  These risks are most acute in developing countries.  For example, Mozambique, where Ireland has consistently invested in the health sector, achieved a reduction in its maternal mortality ratio from 700 to 318 per 100,000 births over the period 2002-15.  While this was a great achievement, it is evident that more needs to be done to strengthen the health system there develop if this ratio is to approach Ireland's maternal mortality ratio of 6 per 100,000 births over the same period.  The Government's policy for international development, <i>A Better World</i>, published last February continues Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding focus on improving the health of women and girls, as part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. </p></reply>

My cabinet colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Charles Flanagan TD, is regularly briefed by the Garda Commissioner on the risks of dissident paramilitary violence and related organised criminality in border regions. In this regard, there are very strong levels of cross border cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and this will of course continue in all circumstances.  </p><p>The Government understands the anxiety and concern being felt by communities in Northern Ireland and border areas about Brexit; however, there is also a responsibility on people , on all sides, to be measured in their comments and responsible in their leadership at community level. There is no excuse whatsoever for violence, or the threat of it. The people of this island, North and South, have consistently shown their support for peaceful, political means to resolve problems and their outright rejection of violence.  </p><p>While there are of course different views, all sincerely held, on the UK approach to exiting the European Union, the agreement that the European Union has now reached with the UK Government does expressly give a real democratic voice for the people of Northern Ireland into the operation of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. </p><p>Any deal, including this one, involves compromise. The Government has consistently tried to listen and respond to the concerns of all those affected by the UK decision to leave the EU, including people from all communities in Northern Ireland and in border regions.</p><p>It is vital that these arrangements work for Northern Ireland, and it is important that the voices of all of the political representatives of Northern Ireland, from all communities, are heard, as is provided for under the Withdrawal Agreement.</p><p>Ratifying this Withdrawal Agreement remains the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. A no deal outcome is in no one&rsquo;s interests.</p><p>In addition to on-going bilateral engagement between myself and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the two Governments discuss Security cooperation through the framework of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, with the participation of the Minister for Justice and Equality. Our discussions at the Conference reflect the significant and effective cross-border cooperation in monitoring and combatting the ongoing risk of violent actions and organised crime by dissident paramilitary groups.</p></reply>

We and our EU partners take these reports very seriously and have raised our concerns with our Chinese counterparts, in bilateral and multilateral contexts, on a consistent basis.</p>  <p>  At the multilateral level, Ireland was among 23 countries that joined a Joint Statement on the human rights situation in Xinjiang at the UN Third Committee on 29 October 2019. This statement was delivered by the UK at the Interactive Dialogue with the Chair of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). Ireland was also one of 22 States to sign a letter which called for China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Xinjiang, and to allow unrestricted access to independent observers. Ireland also participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), held last November. In our intervention we expressed concern at reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs, in particular their detention in political re-education camps, and called on China to respect freedom of religion and belief. We also recommended that China allow the OHCHR access to all regions of the country, including Xinjiang. I also raised this issue bilaterally with the Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Wang Chao, during political consultations in Dublin last year. </p>  <p>  At EU level, this issue was raised at both the EU-China Summit and EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in April this year. During the dialogue the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, these actions must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms, and international laws. The EU has also raised this issue at multilateral level, calling on China to allow meaningful, unrestricted, and unsupervised access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of universal human rights is one of Ireland&rsquo;s core foreign policy issues, and Ireland and the EU will continue to raise these issues during both political and official contacts with the Chinese authorities.</p></reply>

This was followed by the deployment of the army on the streets to deal with the unrest, and overnight curfews in the capital of Santiago and cities across Chile.  The demonstrations have since evolved into larger protests centring on socio-economic inequality in Chile. While most of the protests have been peaceful, there are violent elements among the protesters who have engaged in acts of destruction and violence, including looting and arson. </p>  <p>  I am saddened by the reports of violence, destruction, injuries and loss of life that have occurred during the demonstrations.

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. When planning for the March 2020 Human Rights Council session, we will consider carefully which priorities to set, with a view to focusing the weight of Ireland's efforts, and the Council's attention, on the most grave and troubling situations globally. </p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly in New York in September, I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

No. 353 of 1994) provide that where a person receives a repayment or remission of VRT/VAT in respect of a vehicle purchased to transport <i>&lsquo;a person with disabilities&rsquo;</i>, that person shall undertake to use the vehicle for a period of at least two years from the date of purchase. Paragraph 15 of the Regulations provides that where a vehicle is sold, or otherwise disposed of, or ceases to be used to transport <i>&lsquo;the person with disabilities&rsquo;</i>within two years, a portion of the refund/remission is to be repaid to Revenue.</p><p>The Regulations also provide a formula, based on the open market selling price (OMSP) of the vehicle at the time of disposal, which can be used by Revenue to calculate the amount that should be repaid where the vehicle ceases to be used to transport <i>&lsquo;the person with disabilities&rsquo;</i>within the two-year period. The formula takes account of any depreciation to the vehicle on foot of an accident or damage once supporting insurance or salvage documentation is made available. In situations where the OMSP and relevant supporting documentation is not provided, Revenue seeks repayment at rates of 100% if the vehicle is removed from the Scheme within the first 6 months, 90% if removed between 6 and 12 months and 80% if removed between 13 and 24 months. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the person in question made an online application to bring a new vehicle onto the Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities Scheme in July 2019. The previous vehicle was approved on the Scheme on 15 November 2017. When making the new application the person requested an early disposal (repayment) figure in relation to the previous vehicle but did not provide any information regarding its OMSP or as to why it was being disposed of inside the two-year period. This left Revenue with no alternative but to apply the 80% rate (removed from the Scheme between 13 and 24 months) rather than apply the formula-based method of calculation. </p><p>Revenue has also advised me that it previously explained to the person why it was obliged to apply the 80% repayment rate in the absence of receiving any supporting documentation confirming the revised OMSP following the damage to the vehicle (e.g. insurance or salvage valuation confirmation) but has still not received any information from the person. I am aware that Revenue also made direct contact with the Deputy&rsquo;s office to clarify the requirements. </p><p>To advance matters the person should provide the required information to Revenue&rsquo;s Central Repayments Office, M: TEK II Building, Armagh Road, Monaghan, Co.

It was submitted to me for consideration in September 2017, in advance of its publication on Budget Day, 10 October 2017. The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.  In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.  Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place. </p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.  Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises.  The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.</p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.  A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.  Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.</p></reply>

This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October. </p><p>The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the UK Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020. </p><p>If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2020. </i>This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent. </p><p>The revised Political Declaration envisages an ambitious trading relationship for goods on the basis of a Free Trade Agreement, but until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. My Department has been in contact with the ESRI on the economic impact of the revised Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future relationship. I am satisfied that the existing analysis in the joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI, published in March this year, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships. The analysis included a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), and a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impacts of these were modelled and estimated in the joint research with was published in March this year. </p><p>Under these scenarios, over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, respectively, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. The negative impacts will be most severely felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market &ndash; such as the agri-food, manufacturing and tourism sectors and also SMEs generally &ndash; along with their suppliers. The impact will be particularly noticeable outside the main cities.</p><p>In 2017, my Department published a paper on trade exposures which shows that, relative to other EU Member States, Irish exports are substantially more exposed to the UK in a number of goods sectors. The top five most exposed included the Irish agri-food sub-sectors Cereals, Vegetables and Fruit, and Live Animal products. In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services. </p><p>My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring of next year at the latest. </p></reply>

There is a maximum rebate of 7.5 cents per litre when the retail price is &euro;1.25 (Vat exclusive) or above.   </p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing the road haulage sector due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, I announced in my Budget 2020 speech that the DRS is being enhanced. The detail of this is set out in Finance Bill 2019. In brief, the price floor of &euro;1.00 (Vat exclusive) will remain the same; the marginal rebate rate will double at a price point of &euro;1.07 or above; the maximum rebate amount will remain at 7.5 cents per litre; and the amended DRS will apply to fuel purchased by qualifying operators from 1st January 2020. </p>  <p>  This represents a significant enhancement of the terms of the DRS. By way of example, the current average price of a litre of diesel is &euro;1.093 (Vat exclusive), which if used as the average price under the current DRS would entitle qualifying operators to a rebate of 2.8c per litre. Under the enhanced DRS, qualifying operators would be entitled to a rebate of 4.4c if an average per litre price of &euro;1.109 (Vat exclusive) were to be used as the basis for calculating the rebate. In other words, in the example outlined above, an additional 1.6c to the average price of a litre of diesel would be matched by the additional rebate amount. More generally, at a price point of &euro;1.16 (Vat exclusive), the rebate amount under the enhanced DRS is 7.5c per litre which is 2.7c per litre more than the rebate amount that would be paid under the current DRS.       </p>  <p>  I appreciate that this scheme is a fossil fuel subsidy which the ESRI has found is directly increasing CO2 emissions (as well as non CO2 emissions). However, I consider, on balance, that the specific Brexit challenges faced by hauliers justifies this enhancement. This is intended as a temporary support measure, to be reviewed as part of the annual budgetary process. </p></reply>

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.</p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices, and there were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope.</p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.</p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. </p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT. The options set out in the TSG paper are the only options available; either the standard rate is maintained, or the reduced rate is introduced.</p>  <p>  I am making provision in Finance Bill 2019 to apply the 13.5% rate of VAT to all food supplement products, which will take effect from 1 January 2020. This measure is expected to be cost neutral. The food supplement industry is relatively small in Ireland (approx. &euro;60 million) and the loss to the Exchequer incurred as a result of the lowering of the rate for products currently liable to the standard rate of VAT (23%), should be offset by the increase to products that previously were concessionally zero rated. </p>  <p>  Foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) will remain zero rated. These are well established and defined categories of food that are essential for vulnerable groups of the population. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also remain zero rated as they are food.</p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products for human oral use which are licensed or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;) will remain zero rated under a different VAT provision.</p></reply>

The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the tourism sector remains strong.

This can be accessed at:  .</p><p>These are increases that would not have taken place in the absence of an increase to the carbon tax and the increased funding is additional to that provided by the National Development Plan.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.294.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500064#WRF01500"><p>I am advised by Revenue that, similar to the position that applies in the case of other taxes and duties, penalties can be imposed for various offences relating to local property tax (LPT), such as failure to submit a return or other documentation or the provision of false information. Failure to submit an LPT return or submission of an incorrect LPT return, are liable to a penalty of the amount of the LPT that would be payable with a correct return, subject to a maximum penalty of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  In the normal course of events, a self-employed person is penalised for the late submission (or non-submission) of an income tax return by the imposition of a surcharge on his or her income tax liability. However, a self-employed person who has submitted his or her income tax return on time can also be liable to an income tax surcharge in respect of the late submission of his or her LPT return or the failure to pay LPT.  Where such a person has not submitted his or her LPT return by the time that he or she submits an income tax return, the income tax liability is increased by 10% up to a maximum increase of &euro;63,485.  However, where the LPT return is subsequently submitted and the associated LPT liability is paid, the income tax surcharge is capped at the amount of the LPT liability.</p>  <p>  Unlike self-employed taxpayers, PAYE taxpayers are not generally required to submit an annual income tax return. Therefore, it is not possible to impose a similar type surcharge on PAYE taxpayers for failure to submit an LPT return on time. While PAYE taxpayers and self-employed taxpayers are treated the same in terms of the amount of their LPT liability, the same treatment is not necessary, and not always possible, in relation to how Revenue addresses non-compliance by such taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s compliance actions are tailored according to the type of taxpayer involved and the most effective way to ensure compliance. This is illustrated by the use of the facility to collect LPT liabilities through mandatory deduction at source from a PAYE taxpayer&rsquo;s salary or pension, which is considered to be a fair approach in the context of the surcharge on income tax that can apply to self-employed taxpayers who fail to meet their LPT liabilities.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the vast majority of property owners pay their LPT on time. There is no reason for property owners to put themselves in a position where they become liable to a penalty or surcharge.  If an individual has particular financial circumstances which cause difficulties in meeting his or her LPT liability, he or she may be entitled to a deferral of the tax or may avail of one of a number of payment methods to discharge the liability evenly over the course of the year. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.326.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500064#WRF04800"><p>I am aware of the issues facing some businesses in the leisure sector when it comes to the affordability and availability of insurance. The pricing of insurance products is a commercial matter for insurers and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any function in this matter.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as those in the leisure sector.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to emphasise however that the cost of insurance  remains a priority issue for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and has produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report</i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report</i>.  The latter report in particular makes it clear the impact that the cost of insurance is having on the leisure and other sectors and this position has been reinforced by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s continuing engagement with the sector. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on the leisure sector and there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome it is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. </p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced. This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales. The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>.  This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.</p><p>Other steps take to date to address the cost of insurance include the following: </p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 </i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance;</p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;</p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure sector and many businesses more generally should recede.</p></reply>

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs to address gaps and potential failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging competition and innovation, and facilitating the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities that support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs.  </p><p>Instead of lending directly to SMEs, the SBCI operates through partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers and currently has 6 on-lenders, 3 bank and 3 non-bank finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Finance Ireland Limited, Bibby Financial Services Ireland, and FEXCO Asset Finance. </p><p>During 2018, 91% of SBCI loans went to firms outside Dublin, with 19.5% going to the South West, 10.9% to the South East, 17% to the Mid-West, 11.8% to the West, 12.7% to the Border, 7.4% to the Midlands and 11.7% to the Mid-East. </p><p>The table below shows the level of employment in businesses that received SBCI supported loans by county and region from March 2015 to end Q3 2019: <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. of Jobs</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>2,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>3,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>3,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>20,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>3,700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>49,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>11,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>7,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>13,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>2,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>5,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>3,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>5,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>6,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>2,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>2,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>7,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>3,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>2,700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>6,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>3,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>172,100 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Region</th>       <th>No. of Jobs</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Border</td>       <td>15,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>49,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-East</td>       <td>23,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-West</td>       <td>16,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midland</td>       <td>7,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South-East</td>       <td>14,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South-West</td>       <td>27,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>West</td>       <td>19,300</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.340.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500065#WRG01000"><p>At the outset, as the Deputy is aware neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or to businesses.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to emphasise however that the cost of insurance remains a priority issue for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report</i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.</i>Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed. To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports include the following:  </p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales; </p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>;</p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform. It is expected that the LRC will launch a public consultation into the matter shortly;</p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019;  </p><p>-  Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected; </p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; and,</p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.  </p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses. </p><p>Going forward, some actions which are due in the coming months include the following:</p><p>- The establishment of the Judicial Council and the creation of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee whose purpose will to create new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; </p><p>- The CSO is shortly to make a recommendation related to the feasibility of establishing a price register for insurance costs to businesses;</p><p>- The CBI will  make a recommendation to me before the end of the year regarding potentially expanding the scope of the National Claims Information Database to include employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- The private member's <i>Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill</i>is scheduled to progress through the Oireachtas. The Government proposed committee stage amendments, which, inter alia, included requirements for insurers to inform policy holders, including small businesses, in circumstances where a claim has been made against them;</p><p>- Work is continuing on the establishment of a fraud database. However, significant data protection concerns need to be addressed before other issues (such as the governance or location of such a database) can be decided upon; and,</p><p>- The CIWG is waiting draft Heads from the Department of Justice in relation to Pre-Action Protocols, which have been shown to reduce legal costs in relation to personal injury claims in the UK.</p><p>I believe it is important to emphasise that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. In this regard, the work of the soon to be created Personal Injures Guidelines Committee will be essential in achieving that objective. As the Deputy will be aware, this is not an area that the Government can intervene in, however it is hoped that the Judiciary recognise the importance of this work and prioritise it accordingly.  </p><p>In addition and in light of all of the reforms that have taken place or are soon to take place, my colleague, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy, has been engaging with insurers in order to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and widen their risk appetite to reflect savings made or potential savings in the coming years, in particular if there is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  In this regard, I am encouraged by the comments made by a number of insurers at the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach Oireachtas Committee in July about the passing on of savings arising from a recalibration of award levels downwards.  </p><p>In conclusion, I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations including a reduction in award levels will lead to reductions in pricing in particular for small businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

Donegal is open to visitors daily throughout the year (opening times vary seasonally).  A public carpark, owned by Donegal Co. Council, is available during opening hours and this gives visitors direct access to a universally accessible boardwalk leading to the Monument itself a short distance away.  Basic interpretation is provided in the form of information panels located conveniently at the site.  OPW employs a local caretaker / keyholder to manage the opening and closing of the carpark and maintains visitor data electronically at the site.  The data available indicates that 90,435 visitors were recorded in 2018.  This level of usage by the public suggests that there is considerable interest in An Grian&aacute;n as an attraction and it is popular with both domestic and foreign visitors. However, it is also clear that the volume of footfall and the unregulated and unsupervised nature of the traffic presents significant conservation risks at the site.  Currently, OPW staff are being called on regularly during the summer period in particular to repair physical damage done to the Monument and to clean the site from the after effects of antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  Understanding that the site exhibits considerable tourism potential, OPW has raised with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht the possibility of some level of visitor infrastructure being provided which would enhance the experience and provide a control mechanism that would assist in the sustainable management of visitors. OPW has also met with interested parties locally, including Donegal Co. Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and has suggested that collaboration between the various public agencies that focusses particularly on those that own potential development land near the Monument should be explored.   </p>  <p>  In order to assist with the process of identifying possible ways to improving provision for visitors to the site, OPW early in 2019 commissioned a specialist consultant to develop a Conservation and Management Plan for Grian&aacute;n an Aileach and this work is currently underway.  The OPW has, in the context of the discussions held with public partners, left open the question of the future management and staffing of the site.  Without suitable infrastructure currently, there is no suitable location to house staff and to provide a Guide service would not be feasible in advance of any facilities being built and a decision made as to who should operate the facility.</p></reply>

As part of the review, further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General has been sought.

At that stage, the HSE will be in a position to consider the implications of the guidance for the pension entitlements of the individual in this case, and to communicate with the individual accordingly.</p></reply>

A pre-tender cost exercise  was carried out in 2014 and it was fully designed prior to tenders issuing. The contract was subsequently  awarded on 30 January 2015 in the sum of &euro;27,480,604.70 excluding VAT.  The project budget was fully established  at that stage.</p>  <p>  It is not possible, at this stage,  to disclose the final cost of the project as agreement could not be reached with the contractor and the matter has now  been referred to conciliation.</p>  <p>  During the 2012-2014 period, the project was being procured as part of  a Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract.  A cost plan exercise was carried out during this period in 2010, however the project did not proceed as a PPP contract.  The project was on hold prior to the PPP procurement process.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country.  This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  Normally, special classes are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved. </p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time back in April in respect of the Dublin 15 area. We have made significant progress in a relatively short period with the opening 7 new special classes and a new Special School that will provide 88 places for children with special needs. The new places will help these families and ensure that the children concerned have access to education. </p>  <p>  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. The initial steps in this procedure are currently being progressed. </p>  <p>  The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges that can be addressed when opening new special classes and how we can resolve these challenges by working together and in partnership.</p>  <p>  To this end, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across south Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this vital aspect of education to young people. Importantly, a school&rsquo;s RSE programme should be planned in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school. </p><p>At all times RSE will be based on what is appropriate for a child&rsquo;s age or their development. It is about many things but at its heart will be respect.</p><p>Under no circumstances will the Department of Education and Skills impose a curriculum whereby young children are exposed to instruction or information in relation to sexual activity that is inappropriate. </p><p>The entire focus of RSE is on preparing young people for life, on emphasising the importance of respect for themselves and each other, developing healthy relationships, understanding the importance of consent and helping young people to develop and mature in a positive light. </p><p>In April 2018, a review of RSE in schools was announced by the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Mr. Richard Bruton TD.  The Minister asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a review, not just of the content of the curriculum but of how it is taught in schools.  </p><p>The 2010 World Health Organisation (WHO) document, &lsquo;Standards for Sexuality Education in Europe&rsquo; was referred to in a research paper which fed into the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA) review of RSE in schools. The approach taken in this WHO document has not been endorsed by the NCCA.</p><p>The bill referred to is the Provision of Objective Sex Education Private Members Bill, initiated by Opposition T.D.s.  That Bill has not been passed by the Oireachtas and is not part of the NCCA review of RSE in schools. </p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I am committed to ensuring that any RSE curriculum will be appropriate to the age and developmental stage of the children in our schools.</p></reply>

Not all children/young people attending CAMHS are medically fit to avail of education during all of their stay. </p>  <p>  Since 2014, my Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide teaching staff in CAMHS facilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 on the basis of the number of inpatient beds in each CAMHS unit. The school referred to by the deputy is one such school.</p>  <p>  Current policy does not provide for an additional teaching allocation for CAMHS facilities for children/young people attending as day or out-patients, as young people attending CAMHS as day patients can apply for Home Tuition support to provide for compensatory education in respect of time missed from school, due to medical reasons or attendance at a medical unit. </p>  <p>  As not all inpatient beds in CAMHS Units may be filled at any given time, in such instances, subject to prior approval by my Department, CAMHS Units may utilise spare teaching capacity from their allocated 6:1 ratio to offer guidance or support for children/young people attending CAMHS facilities as day patients, and to assist in maintaining some continuity of education from their base school or liaison with their base school on days that they attend the CAMHS Unit. </p>  <p>  Students in the special school referred to by the Deputy are attending the HSE CAMHS facility, in the first instance, as in-patients, day patients or out-patients for mental health issues rather than special educational needs. </p>  <p>  While the special school in question was originally designated as a special school for Severe Emotional Behaviour Disturbance, since the school&rsquo;s re-location with the HSE&rsquo;s CAMHS unit, the teaching staff allocation has been provided on the basis of the policy outlined above for CAMHS facilities.</p>  <p>  The CAMHS team may refer patients to the school for short term education intervention, designed to provide for some continuity of education, while a patient of the CAMHS Unit. All students remain enrolled in their base schools while attending the CAMHS unit. Special schools attached to CAMHS Units do not enrol students on a full time basis, as their main education placement. Therefore, their enrolment remains transient. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  Children are eligible when they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class in mainstream or special school that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs.  Eligibility is determined in consultation with the NCSE through its network of SENOs. </p>  <p>  As students in special schools attached to a CAMHS facility, including the School referred to by the Deputy, are, in the first instance, attending CAMHS as in-patients, day patients or out-patients for mental health issues rather than special educational needs, transport to the HSE CAMHS unit does not come within the remit of my Department&rsquo;s Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. </p>  <p>  Special School Transport was provided in error to a number of students who attended this special school while day patients of CAMHS. This arrangement was allowed to continue for these students until they completed their time in CAMHS. The school has been advised that no new applications can be considered. </p></reply>

The student has exhausted the appeals process provided for in the Student Support Act 2011.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The NCSE can also consult with other professional e.g. NEPS and will allocate a level of SNA support to a school to ensure that the school has sufficient resources to cater for the significant care needs of the relevant children who are enrolled in the school for whom it has been indicated that there is a care requirement. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  </p>  <p>  It is my Department's policy that every child assessed as requiring SNA support will have access to such support.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.</p>  <p>  SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries, and schools with enrolments of 626-699 will be permitted to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two posts filled. These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.

However, the NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme. These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down syndrome.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.  </p><p>It is expected that the Group will make recommendations shortly concerning a revised scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.

Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the current school year.  Budget 2018 provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.   </p>  <p>  The Budget 2020 measure of improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four teachers or less will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.  </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.569.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500069#WRL01300"><p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries, and schools with enrolments of 626-699 will be permitted to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two posts filled. These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

For the past number of years, my Department has seconded an official to the Department of Justice and Equality to support the arrangement of education provision for children residing in accommodation centres.  This arrangement facilitates close liaison with relevant areas of my Department in relation to education provision.  This official is also available to advise schools on specific queries arising, including on the range of supports available to schools and on how to access supports. Tusla Educational Welfare Service (EWS), which is under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, assists with school enrolment and attendance.</p>  <p>   As new Centres are identified, and once the numbers and age ranges of the children are identified, my Department will ensure that where the increase in the numbers of students entitles the school to an additional teaching allocation, this will be provided as soon as possible.   Where the enrolment of the children resident in the Direct Provision Centre entitles the school to an additional teaching allocation for English as an Additional Language (EAL), this will be provided as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Where the increased enrolment requires an increase in the school&rsquo;s special educational needs teacher profile, they will receive, as soon as possible, 5 additional Special Education Teaching hours for every 25 additional pupils who are enrolled, or a proportion of five hours if less than 25, where the number of enrolments are material, i.e. 5 pupils or more.  Additional Special Needs Assistant provision is currently provided for identified additional care needs which is contingent upon assessments being carried out. </p>  <p>  The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The staffing arrangements as set out in Circular 0019/2019 available on my Department&rsquo;s website operates in a clear and transparent manner.  The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an Independent Appeals Board.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  For school planning purposes Midleton is located in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area.</p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country.  This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  Before approaching a particular school to request the establishment of a special class, the NCSE take into account both present and future potential need within the area and must be satisfied that the class is sustainable and appropriately located.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing its work at local level to ensure all children can access a suitable school placement for the forthcoming school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p>  <p>  In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools. </p>  <p>  The brief for the school building project in the school referred to by the Deputy is to provide a new 1000 pupil post primary school and 4 class Special Educational Needs unit together with all ancillary accommodation on a site off the Ballyogan Road adjacent to Leopardstown Racecourse.</p>  <p>  Planning permission was granted by D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council on the 13th June 2019 subject to 18 no. conditions.  Two of these conditions relating to the provision of a public greenway were subsequently the subject of a first party appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la; the decision on which is currently awaited.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to give a timeframe for the delivery of this project until the statutory consents are secured.  </p></reply>

The review was carried out by a local Auditing Firm/Catering Business Manager.  The Audit Committee of the College met on the 26th of April and considered the findings and recommendations from this review.  Financial issues in the operation of the service were key factor in the recommendations of the review.  Additionally the review identified the need for changes to service for both Staff and Students.  </p>  <p>  The report included a plan to restructure and implement new services so that it would operate as a viable business operation.</p>  <p>  The following actions were subsequently approved by the Board of Directors of the College. The Canteen reopened in September with a revised reduced offering which is being regularly updated. It should be noted that this is Phase 1 of the new plan and is centred on increasing footfall, income generation and future sustainability of the service. </p>  <p>  The operation of the Canteen is under weekly review and it is expected that under Phase 2 of the project will be implemented once sufficient footfall and revenue projections suggest that this is a viable and sustainable operation going forward.  This phase will provide further enhancements to the offerings, the canteen space itself and the opening hours which will benefit both students and staff. </p>  <p>  Additionally, proposals in relation  to future capital investment in St Angela&rsquo;s are currently being developed by for consideration by the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p><p>Opening new special classes and the enrolment of students is a matter for individual schools in the first instance.  My Department has no role either in making or deciding on enrolment applications to schools or keeping waiting lists. In these matters, schools are required to adhere to the requirements of relevant legislation and the policies of my Department.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country.  This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs. The local SENO contact details are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>Normally, special classes are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved. </p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p><p>The NCSE is continuing its work at local level to ensure all children can access a suitable school placement for the forthcoming school year and beyond. </p><p>As Minister, I would much prefer that schools provide the necessary places for the children in their community.  Where this is not the case, however, I am prepared to use the legislation to ensure that children can access a suitable education.</p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to an individual child, I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

Analysis of the parental preferences expressed in each area surveyed indicated that there was sufficient parental demand to support changes in school patronage in 28 areas, including in Dungarvan.  </p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school can be opened where a school building became, or was due to become, available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, including in the case of Dungarvan, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, my Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  To date, it has not been possible to secure a school property to facilitate a new school being established in Dungarvan. However, the Department is continuing its efforts in relation to identifying a suitable solution under the patronage divesting process, which would facilitate a new Educate Together school being established to serve the Dungarvan area.  It is not possible at this stage, however, to give a timeframe for the establishment of such a school.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools;</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools;</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels. Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019/20 school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. Of these 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD.</p>  <p>  Opening new special classes and the enrolment of students is a matter for individual schools in the first instance.  My Department has no role either in making or deciding on enrolment applications to schools or keeping waiting lists. In these matters, schools are required to adhere to the requirements of relevant legislation and the policies of my Department.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country.  This includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  Normally, special classes are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the Council has faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved. </p>  <p>  As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time back in April in respect of the Dublin 15 area. We have made significant progress in a relatively short period with the opening 7 new special classes and a new Special School that will provide 88 places for children with special needs. The new places will help these families and ensure that the children concerned have access to education. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing its work at local level to ensure all children can access a suitable school placement for the forthcoming school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I would much prefer that schools provide the necessary places for the children in their community.  Where this is not the case, however, I am prepared to use the legislation to ensure that children can access a suitable education.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the identified need for special class placements in a number of specific areas, I have arranged for the question to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

These necessitate a collaborative approach to policing with law enforcement agencies north and south of the border and there is close ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.</p><p>The importance of this ongoing high level of cooperation has been emphatically demonstrated again in recent times, in particular by the abhorrent attack in Co. Fermanagh in September.  I have visited the area and was briefed by the Commissioner and the investigation team.  It is clear that elements of that horrific crime took place on both sides of the border and a joint investigation is ongoing, including continuing sharing of information and evidence, between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.</p><p>In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the agreement <i>A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan</i>, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force, which is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK (HM) Revenue and Customs.</p><p>Both Governments are determined that, regardless of the political outcome of Brexit, the excellent ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland must and will continue to combat the threat posed by dissidents and criminals that seek to exploit the policing challenges posed by the border.</p><p>I have spoken recently to the UK Home Secretary and have also met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I can assure the Deputy that I took these opportunities to reaffirm our deep commitment to continuing the close working relationship that we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom on such matters as security and risks in the Border region.  The Deputy will also be aware of An Taoiseach's discussions with Prime Minister Johnson, as detailed in his responses to Parliamentary Questions on the matter. </p><p>As Deputies may recall, in September, I attended the 17th Annual Cross Border Conference on Organised Crime in Co. Cavan, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues.  This provided an additional opportunity for all those attending, including the Commissioner, the PSNI Chief Constable and the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, to discuss issues arising. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner recently made an operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit (ASU) in Cavan which became operational last month.  It will complement the work of the Units nationwide, including those in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth in the Northern Region.</p><p>I also want to assure the Deputies that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work in addressing cross-border criminality and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform this critical role. The Northern region continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 35% over the past 3 years, with the result that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect. </p><p>I am assured that requirements in the region will in the usual way be kept under ongoing review by Garda management. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, I understand from the Commissioner that further resources can and will be provided through redeployment. </p></reply>

In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, however, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service. </p><p>The Courts Service have informed me that any party to a court case can bring an application to the presiding judge to access the digital audio record of proceedings. The procedure for bringing an application in each jurisdiction is set out in the following Rules of Court:-</p><p>- District Court Rules- Order 35</p><p>- Circuit Court Rules- Order 67A</p><p>- Superior Court Rules- Order 123</p><p>These rules also set out the terms on which such access may be granted.  While a party to a case may apply to the court to access the recording, the granting of access and the terms under which such access is granted is a matter for the court.</p><p>The Courts Service does not record the length of time between an application being lodged, the date of the Court application and the release of a record of proceedings. However, in general, once a court grants such an application, the copy record is produced on a priority basis and sent to the person who has applied for it within a matter of days.</p><p>In some courts, the digital audio recording system does not record precisely when witnesses speak. Consequently, where parties apply to access recordings in these courts, it will require a staff member to listen back to a recording of hours of court proceedings. In this event, there can be a slight delay in the preparation of the copy of the record.</p></reply>

Fireworks are regulated and can only be imported into Ireland under licence. Licences for the import of fireworks are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.  </p><p>Under Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006:</p><p>- It is an offence for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence;</p><p>- It is an offence to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, and;</p><p>- It is an offence to light unlicensed fireworks in a public place.</p><p>Part 6 of the 2006 Act also gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to make arrests in relation to the possession of unlicensed fireworks.</p><p>The penalties for these offences are very severe.  Having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment. Igniting the fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalties.  </p><p>Finally, I would point out that each year, as Halloween approaches, my Department runs an advertising campaign highlighting both the public safety aspects as well as the illegality of using fireworks.  I launched the most recent campaign on 21 October 2019, in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Fire Service.

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.</p><p>In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country. </p><p>The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. </p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical and I am pleased that funding is in place for the recruitment of up to 700 Garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff in 2020, depending on the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision on the balance required.</p><p>For the Deputy's information, the attached table, as supplied by the Commissioner, sets out the latest figures as requested. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 30 September 2019, the total Garda strength of the GDOCB is 105.

It involves insidious and coercive behaviour directed at forcing compliance of another person against their will.  The intimidation can be either explicit or implicit, involving actual, threatened or perceived threats of violence to a person or damage to property. </p>  <p>  The threat of violence to enforce drug debt impacts people's lives greatly and can create an atmosphere of fear within communities, particularly those where there is a concentration of illicit drug markets.  In many instances, such communities are already marginalised and are also having to contend with social and public disorder and other forms of criminality associated with the illicit drugs trade.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that whether or not a family or loved one has paid these debts, this should not be a deterrent to seeking help, advice and support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN), have developed a framework, &lsquo;the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme&rsquo;, which is now been implemented on a National level since 2013, to assist persons who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 28 Inspectors nominated in this regard. They liaise directly with the local Superintendent in relation to each individual case, as required.  I am further informed that there are 6 such inspectors in the Dublin Metropolitan Region; 7 in the North-Western Region; 8 in the Eastern Region; and 7 in the Southern Region.</p>  <p>  I am informed that, in dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the utmost regard to the safety and most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat, the best level of security, advice and support.  I am further informed that confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the Programme.</p>  <p>  I consulted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Deputy's query on the number of times support has been sought from and provided under the drug related intimidation reporting programme since it was established.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this information is highly sensitive and not suitable for release into the public domain. </p></reply>

Due to an unexpected rise in applications (figures are up 53% in the first nine months of this year), existing Direct Provision Centres, which offer accommodation, food, utilities and a suite of State services, have reached capacity.</p><p>I am advised that as of 20th October 2019, 7,537 persons were being provided with accommodation by the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS, formerly the Reception and Integration Agency) of my Department. Currently, there are 6,091 persons residing in the 38 accommodation centres located nationwide across 18 counties. As these centres are currently operating at full capacity, there are also a further 1,478 people being accommodated in emergency accommodation in hotels and guest houses. My Department does not disclose the location of emergency accommodation centres in order to protect the identity of international protection applicants.  </p><p>There are currently over 700 people being accommodated in Mosney Accommodation Centre. Please see table below given breakdown of nationality of those seeking asylum being accommodated in Mosney. </p><p><b>Nationality of Mosney Residents as of 20th October 2019</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Country Of  Origin </th>       <th>Number of applicants</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Albania</td>       <td>111</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nigeria</td>       <td>102</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pakistan</td>       <td>90</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Zimbabwe</td>       <td>80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Africa</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Malawi</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Congo DR</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Syria</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Iraq</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kosovo</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other</td>       <td>150</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department has introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing the time taken to determine applications. The International Protection Act, 2015, introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications. Under the single procedure all elements of a person's protection claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are considered together rather than sequentially. The aim of the single procedure is to help reduce waiting times significantly. </p><p>An applicant who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation/decision within approximately 15 months, provided that no complications arise. Prioritised cases are being processed in just under 9 months. Prioritised applications include those from countries such as Syria and Eritrea and from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors.  My Department is aiming to reduce processing times for all first instance decisions to 9 months by the end of this year.</p></reply>

The Act distinguishes between the entitlement to citizenship by birth and descent and to the acquisition of citizenship through the naturalisation process. Following a referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship. As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004. The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005. As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth. Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.</p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not, at birth, have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years residence in the State. This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation. </p>  <p>  I recognise that there are some cases of young people who have grown up here but who, as a result of their parents' illegal status, find themselves in a difficult situation. However, it is important to emphasise, that when it comes to people living here illegally, the only option for regularisation is on a case by case basis.   Inevitably, granting permission to children and young people who reside in Ireland in an undocumented capacity will require that other family members must also be allowed to remain in order to care for and support the children. However, where people who have had an application for residence refused or who simply overstay their permission to reside in this country and do not apply for an extension to their permission, the State must be allowed to exercise its legal right to remove them from the State.  It would be unwise to permit people to simply ignore our immigration laws and allow them and their families to remain here merely on the basis of the length of time that they have resided here without permission.  </p>  <p>  I am, however, open to exploring all legal solutions to the issue of children who have grown up here in circumstances where they or their family are undocumented. I met with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI) in June to discuss the situation and my Department has on-going engagement with MRCI and other NGOs on this matter.   </p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact the Immigration Service of my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their family's status.</p></reply>

Following his engagement with the family, I received a proposal from Judge Haughton for some changes to the terms of reference for the scoping exercise.  </p><p>This necessitated further consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Subsequent legal advices were provided which, in particular, emphasised the requirement to abide by the jurisprudence set down in the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Shatter v. Guerin</i>which was delivered in 2019.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the terms of reference of the scoping exercise have been finalised. My Department wrote to Judge Haughton on 23 September to ask him to begin his scoping exercise and to make an initial report by mid-November.</p><p>Judge Haughton is of course free to make any recommendation he sees fit, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  Should he consider it necessary to recommend an inquiry, of whatever type, I have asked him to provide me with draft terms of reference.</p><p>While I regret that this process has taken some time, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that the scoping exercise was framed and conducted in accordance with that decision.  All of us in these Houses must operate within the new legal landscape of sensitive matters of this type, which are subject to the supervision of the Courts.  I look forward to receipt of the initial report of Judge Haughton later this month.</p></reply>

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets. </p>  <p>  The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government's commitment to ensure that the Bureau is adequately resourced, the CAB&rsquo;s staffing and budgetary allocation has increased significantly in recent years. Since 2016, the Bureau's staffing resources have increased from 71 to its current level of 85, with staff numbers due to rise to 91 during this year. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the Bureau's budgetary allocation has gone up from &euro;7.042 million in 2016 to &euro;8.603m in 2019. The Bureau's budget for 2020 has been increased by a further &euro;0.5 million, to a total of &euro;9.1 million.</p>  <p>  A Bureau Legal Officer is appointed to the Bureau by the Minister to assist the Bureau with its objectives and functions. Other than this statutory post, I am advised that there are no legal professionals formally seconded to the Criminal Assets Bureau and rather that the Chief State Solicitor's Office provides the necessary legal services to the Bureau in the operation of its role. </p></reply>

The International Protection Act, 2015, introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications. Under the single procedure all elements of a person's protection claim (refugee status, subsidiary protection status and permission to remain) are considered together rather than sequentially. The aim of the single procedure is to help reduce waiting times significantly.</p><p>An applicant who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation/decision within approximately 15 months, provided that no complications arise. Prioritised cases are being processed in just under 9 months. Prioritised applications include those from countries such as Syria and Eritrea and from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors.  My Department is aiming to reduce processing times for all first instance decisions to 9 months by the end of this year.</p></reply>

This review was published in September 2008.   The review concluded that &ldquo;the complex nature of the offences in the 1989 Act arises primarily from the overriding need to balance fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, privacy and basic principles of criminal liability, with the need to protect individuals and groups against vicious racist abuse&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The 2008 review recommended that legislative change alone would be insufficient and that measures to address racism should be included as part of an overall integration and anti-racism strategy, including education and public awareness programmes and a wide range of measures to ensure migrant and minority communities are more included in Irish society.</p>  <p>  The review of the 1989 Act being conducted at present by my Department is designed to identify how our legislation on hate speech, including incitement to hatred, can be made fit for purpose in a modern democracy. This review is one part of a suite of measures which will include the development of new legislation on both hate speech and hate crime.</p>  <p>  As part of the review, I launched a public consultation process on 24 October which is open and inviting submissions until 13 December 2019 and will gather the views of communities, experts and all interested persons on how our incitement legislation should be changed to make it fit for purpose. Details of the consultation are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Some of the questions in the consultation include: what limits it is appropriate to place on freedom of expression when it comes to hate speech; what forms of hate speech are serious enough that they should be a criminal offence; whether the list of protected characteristics included in the legislation should be changed; whether the existing legislation is adequate to deal with online communications, and whether the need to prove the intent or likelihood or stirring up hatred should be altered. </p>  <p>  Separately to the work on incitement, my Department is finalising research on the effectiveness of the different legislative approaches to tackling hate crime in other countries, in order to learn from experience elsewhere and use this information to identify the approach that will be most suitable for Ireland. When this research has concluded I will bring forward proposals for new hate crime legislation. These will be published and the views of experts, communities and the public will be taken into account to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone.</p></reply>

The Board also has responsibility to provide a family mediation service. </p><p>I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board on behalf of the Deputy and they have provided the following information.</p><p>Civil legal aid and advice is provided primarily by solicitors employed by the Board through a network of law centres . There are 30 full time and 12 part-time law centres.  Specific law centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway include an international protection speciality and there are also dedicated units in Dublin dealing with personal injury and/or medical negligence cases and cases involving children at risk.  Family mediation services are provided through 8 full time offices and 9 part time offices.</p><p>The Board also engages private solicitors to supplement the services provided by Board solicitors in certain areas of law on a case by case basis, those areas of law being; District Court family law matters, Circuit Court judicial separation and divorce cases, international protection cases, and cases on foot of the Abhaile scheme.</p><p>I am advised that the Board does not have to hand a breakdown of the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office/county in a given year. It should be borne in mind that applicants are free to apply for legal services to any law centre and are not bound to apply in their county of residence. Furthermore, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.</p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from my Department. This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.  The Board&rsquo;s other main sources of income are financial contributions from applicants and costs recovered.</p><p>The grant funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department in 2019 is &euro;40.796 million.  The largest cost of operating the law centre network is staff salaries. Solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board are civil servants of the State and are subject to the standard civil service terms and conditions of employment and are employed on standard civil service pay scales.  The allocation of staffing resources in the Legal Aid Board is a matter for the Chief Executive and senior management, within its budgetary parameters.</p><p>The Board seeks to ensure that a person who qualifies for civil legal aid (legal services) will be offered an appointment with a solicitor within a maximum period of four months from the time the application is completed or will be offered earlier legal advice if it is not possible to provide full legal services within four months. A priority service is provided in certain cases including cases involving domestic violence, child abduction, applications by the State (Tusla) to take children into care or under supervision, and cases that have statutory time limits close to expiry.</p><p>The waiting times and numbers for first and second consultation appointments are published on a regular basis on the website of the Legal Aid Board (www.legalaidboard.ie).</p><p>As of the 31st December 2016, there were 1,864 persons waiting for legal services which was a reduction from the figure of 2,319 at the start of the year.  At the end of 2017 the number of persons waiting for legal services stood at 1,776.  At the end of 2018 the number of persons waiting for legal services stood at 1,754 (see Table 1). This was the sixth successive year in which there was a decrease (from over 5,000 in 2013).  The number of persons waiting for a first consultation with a Legal Aid Board solicitor stands at 1,933 at the end of October, 2019.</p><p><b>Table 1 </b>-<b>The number of persons waiting on the 31</b><b><sup>st</sup></b><b>December 2018</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2013 </th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number Waiting </td>       <td>5,067 </td>       <td>3,412 </td>       <td>2,319 </td>       <td>1,864 </td>       <td>1,776 </td>       <td>1,754 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The maximum waiting time in weeks, for non prioritised matters, as of the 30<sup>th</sup>September, 2019 is set out for the various law centres in Table 2. It must be emphasised that this table gives a snapshot of waiting times at a particular point in time. Waiting times will go up and down depending on demand and on the capacity of each law centre to offer appointments to new clients.  A number of law centres that currently have long waiting lists are being affected by solicitor turnover and other staff movement or absence which the Board is seeking to address. Where capacity permits, applications in Dublin are transferred between law centres to allow earlier first consultation appointments for applicants.

Various threat detection and security systems are in place to mitigate against risks to data security and integrity.</p><p><b>Courts Service</b></p><p>The large majority of Courts Service users use thin client devices and virtualized applications which do not use Windows desktop operating systems. Where Windows 7 had previously been deployed, many instances have been upgraded to newer operating systems and work is continuing on upgrading or migrating the remainder. </p><p>There is limited exposure to the risk of malware attack or security risks from the failure to upgrade computers from Windows 7. The computers deployed in the Courts Service have a locked down configuration which provides an additional layer of security and measures are in place at our firewalls which make it difficult for malware to enter the Courts network. These include mail scanning, link filtering and blocking of suspect websites. A patching policy ensures appropriate security patching is applied. A detailed user security policy ensures that permissions are restricted and the potential for security breaches is limited. End user security awareness is provided through periodic general security advice and notifications in relation to specific threats.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution under review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure optimum use is made of resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit (HTICU) forms part of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) and falls under the remit of Assistant Commissioner, Special Crime Operations, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. </p><p>I am further informed that the unit is staffed by Garda members of various ranks, up to Detective Superintendent, as well as Garda staff.  I am informed that the following table, provided to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the staffing levels of the Unit since 2014 and as at 5 November. <table>    <tr>       <th>YEAR</th>       <th>TOTAL</th>       <th>Garda Members</th>       <th>Garda Staff</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware of training in this area. A 3-day training course entitled &lsquo;Tackling Trafficking in Human Beings, Prevention, Protection, Prosecution &amp;amp; Partnership&rsquo; has been developed and delivered jointly between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). This training is delivered to frontline Garda&iacute;, investigators, immigration officers, border management (Dublin Airport), who are most likely to identify potential victims of human trafficking.</p><p>The Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-Ordination Unit deliver this three-day human trafficking course twice annually. Human rights issues as they pertain to human trafficking are a fundamental component of the course and international experts on human trafficking also make presentations. I understand that as at year end 2018, over 1,400 Garda members had been trained in this course. </p></reply>

Such persons may remain in the State while their application is examined.  If, after these procedures, an applicant has been found not to be in need of international protection, that person is no longer considered to be an asylum seeker or to be in need of  international protection. </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) gives the Minister for Justice and Equality powers to make a Deportation Order. Section 3(2) of that Act sets out the nature of persons in respect of whom such an Order can be made. This includes, among other categories of person, a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State, a person whose deportation has been recommended by a court in the State before which such person was indicted for or charged with any crime or offence, a person whose application for asylum,  based on the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), has been refused by the Minister and a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good. </p>  <p>  Section 3(3) of the Act provides the procedure to be followed before any such Order can be made while section 3(4) sets out the three options open to any person put on notice of a proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of them. These options are to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to deportation or to submit written representations against the making of such an Order.  </p>  <p>  A refoulement consideration must also be carried out prior to any deportation consideration. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  No person is returned to their country of origin, or their place of former habitual residence, where there is a credible risk to their life or freedom.  </p>  <p>  The data available to the Immigration Service of my Department suggests that the State did not return any individual to Zimbabwe in the years mentioned in the Deputy's query. </p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences, crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.</p><p>In 2015 the Commissioner, established a new national Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GDOCB), which brought together the Organised Crime Unit and the Garda National Drug Unit so as to create a robust entity to effectively tackle drugs and organised crime, as it currently exists in this country. </p><p>The GDOCB leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. I am informed that this approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. </p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical and I am pleased that funding is in place for the recruitment of up to 700 Garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff in 2020, depending on the Commissioner&rsquo;s operational decision on the balance required.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 30 September 2019, the total Garda strength of the GDOCB is 105. There are also 13 Garda staff assigned to the Bureau as of the same date.  </p><p>I further understand from the Garda authorities that, in addition to the GDOCB, the Garda strength of the Louth Divisional Drugs Unit in the years 2016 to 2019 was as follows: </p><p>2016: following table (provided to me by the Garda authorities) sets out the Garda strength of the Louth Garda Division Drugs unit from the years 2016 to 30 September 2019, as requested by the Deputy.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Garda members</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 (as at 30 September)</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the recent judgment of the High Court relating to continuous residency under Section 15(1)(c) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 (as amended) has given cause for concern. The matter remains before the courts, with the Court of Appeal reserving judgement on the appeal on 8 October, and the matter, therefore, remains sub-judice. The outcome of the appeal will have a bearing on whether or not legislation is required. Should it be necessary, I intend to introduce a Bill in the Oireachtas as soon as possible this term.</p>  <p>  My Department is doing everything possible to put a solution in place on an urgent basis. At the end of July, I obtained Cabinet approval for a proposed Bill to address the matter and intensive work is taking place in my Department where officials are working with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to finalise the draft Bill. </p>  <p>  The advice to those who are planning to apply for citizenship is to continue to collect all of the necessary proofs that support their application and to submit a comprehensive application form. Once a solution is in place, if any additional information is required, applicants will be contacted as part of the processing of their application. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the Immigration Service is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Individual Accounting Officers are responsible for ensuring that public procurement is discharged in line with the standard accounting and procurement rules and procedures and that contract prices are fair and reasonable and represent best value for money.  Procurement activity is subject to both internal audit within the Department and review by the Office of the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General.</p>  <p>  The aim of procurement rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. </p>  <p>  In general, competitive tendering is used unless exceptional circumstances exist which justify an alternative approach. Situations where competitive tendering may not be appropriate, feasible or cost-effective include where due to the proprietary nature of goods or services there is a sole supplier of these goods or services, where annual licensing renewals arise, where specific specialist knowledge is required, where urgency is a factor, or where it has been necessary to extend a pre-existing contract for a period of time pending a tender competition being completed.</p>  <p>  The Department must also balance situations where the process of establishing a procurement framework by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is ongoing. As the Deputy will be aware, Government policy is to make use of such central arrangements where possible. Where the establishment of a framework is pending, the Department may roll over existing arrangements without a competitive tender process to avoid entering a long-term contract with relatively disadvantageous terms.</p>  <p>  Department of Finance Circular 40/02 requires Government Departments and Offices to submit an annual report to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for contracts above &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) awarded without a competitive process by 31 March of the following year. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that procurement reported under Circular 40/02 is not inherently non-compliant. Rather, it is the subset of procurement activity for which competitive tendering is not considered appropriate under the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Details of contracts awarded by my Department without the use of a competitive process are outlined in the Department&rsquo;s Appropriation Accounts for 2017 and 2018.  Work is continuing on compiling similar information for 2019 and this will be published in the 2019 Appropriation Account.</p>  <p>  In 2018 a determination was made by the Office of the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General that the procurement with respect to eighteen contracts reported under Circular 40/02 was non-compliant. As set out in the Appropriation Accounts in 2018, these contracts were extended without a competitive process primarily while revised long-term arrangements or OGP frameworks were put in place. </p>  <p>  The Department has reviewed these contracts and is satisfied that while delays in establishing long-term arrangements were regrettable, the consequent decisions to roll over existing contracts were necessary and justified due to the continuing need to maintain the supply of goods or services to clients. </p>  <p>  I have requested that relevant agencies under the remit of my Department, and operating under a separate Vote structure (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Irish Prison Service and Courts Service) respond directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

In such a situation, the debtor&rsquo;s Personal Insolvency Practitioner can apply to Court under section 115A.  The Court will carefully scrutinise the proposal, and the refusal by creditors, in the light of the statutory criteria set out in section 115A. If the Court is satisfied that those criteria are met, it has power to impose the rejected proposal on creditors, allowing the debtor to return to solvency and, wherever possible, to remain in their home. </p><p>Abhaile, the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, provides expert financial and legal advice and help to a borrower in this situation, including legal aid for an application made under section 115A. Over the past 3 years, the Courts have built up an important body of case law on the application of section 115A.  This has greatly clarified the rights and responsibilities of debtors and creditors regarding the resolution of home mortgage arrears - both in section 115A proceedings, and more broadly for those borrowers seeking to negotiate restructure arrangements directly with their lenders with the help of MABS and other agencies. </p><p>Subsection section 115A(18)(b) effectively provides that to avail of section 115A, the borrower must have been in arrears on their home mortgage before 1 January 2015, <i>or</i>have entered into an alternative repayment arrangement with their mortgage lender (or other secured creditor) before that date. Thus, the section is not limited to persons actually in arrears on 1 January 2015, and also covers a borrower who prior to that date had entered into a long-term interest only alternative repayment arrangement to resolve their arrears.</p><p>However, I can assure the Deputy that this is among the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Acts which are under review by my Department: that review is near completion, taking careful account of the submissions made during the public consultation held earlier and of the changing profile of home mortgage arrears since the enactment of the 2015 Act.  I expect to receive the report early in the New Year and to bring proposals for further legislative reform to Government in early course. </p></reply>

This is due to a number of reasons, primarily the necessity for security checks to establish the good character of the applicant, time taken for appropriate checks to ensure applicants satisfy the relevant legislative criteria and deficiencies in supporting documentation supplied by applicants at the time of application. </p><p>It is recognised that an application for a certificate of naturalisation is a complex process requiring a considerable amount of supporting documentation. This is necessitated by the need to protect the integrity of the immigration system and also to ensure that I as Minister have all available information available to me to facilitate making a fully informed decision.</p><p>There are just over 20,000 applications for certificates of naturalisation on hand in respect of both adults and minors. These applications are at various stages of processing. The range encompassed by the naturalisation process includes applications recently received by Citizenship Division and those which have been fully concluded and await an invitation to a citizenship ceremony. It should be noted that once a decision has been communicated to an applicant, there may be a delay of some months before the applicant is issued an invite to the next available citizenship ceremony, which every adult applicant must attend and where the oath of fealty to the State is taken. </p><p>While the information is not currently available in the format requested by the Deputy I can inform him that applications have been received from 190 nationalities. The top 20 nationalities, which are listed in the table below,  make up almost three quarters of all applications. </p><p>The greatest number of applications have been received by UK and Polish nationals (over 10% of all applications each) followed by Pakistan and Romania.</p><p><b>Percentage of total applications by Country</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>United Kingdom </th>       <th>11% </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Poland </td>       <td>11% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pakistan </td>       <td>8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Romania </td>       <td>8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nigeria </td>       <td>7% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>India </td>       <td>6% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brazil </td>       <td>3% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Latvia </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Philippines </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>China (Including Hong Kong) </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>United States Of America </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Africa </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Syrian Arab Republic </td>       <td>2% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Somalia </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ukraine </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bangladesh </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The Democratic Republic Of The Congo, </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hungary </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lithuania </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afghanistan </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With regard to the number of applications received in respect of each country from the oldest application to 2018 and to date in 2019, by country, I must inform the Deputy that my Department does not maintain the information in that format.  </p><p>Of the applications on hand, 31% were received in the last 6 months, 31% are on hand for between 6 and 12 months, 25% are on hand for between 12 and 24 months , while 12% are more than 2 years old. In general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The average processing time from the date an application was received to the date a decision was made was 6.7 months in 2016, 7.2 months in 2017 and 6.5 months in 2018. However, I can assure the Deputy that all applications are followed through to a decision.</p><p>For applications decided in 2019, the average time from application to decision has been 10 months. It is important to state that the average 6 months processing timeline, as it pertains to applications processed during 2019 has been negatively impacted as a result of the recent High Court Judgment, of which we await an outcome from the Court of Appeal. The exact impact cannot be quantified at this remove, pending a successful resolution of same.  </p><p>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving such as reflecting the need to respond to changing international circumstances and also to ongoing service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and work practices. </p><p>Each citizenship application is unique and is assessed on its merits according to the administrative and legislative conditions in place at the time of application. The Immigration Service of my Department devotes considerable resources to the processing of these applications. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the Immigration Service website at <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Maximum sentences of 10 years are provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while maximum sentences of 5 years are provided for the offence of possession of stolen property. </p>  <p>  Irish law relating to the sale and purchase of scrap metal is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and arises under the Waste Management Act 1996.  The Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (SI No 320 of 2014) apply to the sale and purchase of scrap metals and were designed to improve the traceability of such scrap metal sales.  The regulations impose an obligation on businesses to apply due diligence measures to ensure the traceability of any waste purchased.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently drafting a Bill in relation to the purchase of precious metals by registered outlets from the public.  The Bill will create a licensing system for any dealers in &lsquo;cash for gold&rsquo; or other precious metals and will require verification of the identity and so on of those selling precious metals second hand.  Breaches of the requirements under the Bill will be a criminal offence.  It is also intended that the Bill will also provide additional powers to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of premises where &lsquo;cash for gold&rsquo; transactions take place.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are also actively involved in the Metal Theft Forum, which is a collaborative working group between State stakeholders and industry representatives to improve information sharing around the issue of metal theft.  The Forum is chaired by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the EPA, An Post and a wide range of non-State representatives including telecoms companies, the ESB and others.</p></reply>

As of 25 October 2019, the Dublin Visa Office was processing tourist/visit visa applications received in Dublin on 1 October 2019.  Processing times for other Visa Offices overseas and for Embassies will vary but are generally between 3 and 6 weeks at this time, with many applications processed inside those timeframes, depending on travel dates. </p>  <p>  I am informed that there has been an increase in the number of visa applications across most categories, in line with increased economic activity generally.  Notwithstanding this, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases, are better than the same time last year. </p>  <p>  The business target for processing 'short-stay C' visas is within eight weeks (current processing time in Dublin for most categories is within four weeks).  However, the processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors such as the volume and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods, seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.   </p>  <p>  It has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the number of applications awaiting a decision in every processing centre. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that every effort is made to keep processing times to a minimum, and a number of measures have been put in place to deal with the increased demand for visas to come to Ireland.  This has included the assignment of additional staff to deal with applications, and more generally the streamlining of visa processes where possible.  The position in this regard is being kept under review. </p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account. </p></reply>

An allocation of &euro;1.76 billion was provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019. I am also pleased to have secured a further &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year. Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Furthermore, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT resources and the networking of Garda stations, are matters for the Commissioner in light of availability of resources and identified operational demands.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that broadband networks and services are used to connect stations to the Garda network for official purposes. All of the connections to the Garda stations are managed in the telecommunications branch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the speed of the network connection meets the requirements of the particular location.</p>  <p>  As at the 24 October 2019 there were 565 Garda stations in the State. I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the number which are networked can vary but that as at 24 October, 519 of these stations are fully networked.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that any member attached to a currently unconnected station can access PULSE at their local district station.  Members in non-networked locations can also contact the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) or an associated networked station if required.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that options for providing members attached to those remaining stations not yet networked with local access to Garda ICT services are actively being explored.  This includes an assessment of the availability or otherwise of local broadband services and/or the provision of mobile technology.</p></reply>

The proposed updating follows on from the review work undertaken in the Department of Justice and Equality and from the consultations held with interested stakeholders. The Government also approved the concept of the establishment of a new gambling regulatory authority as an independent statutory body operating under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  The proposals in the General Scheme were reviewed by the Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling. The Group's Report was approved and published by the Government on 20 March 2019. The Report contained a number of significant recommendations concerning all aspects of gambling activity. In particular, it recommended that future responsibility for licensing and regulation of all forms of gambling, including online gambling, rest with a proposed new gambling regulatory authority. </p>  <p>  I hosted a major seminar on the future licensing and regulation of gambling at Farmleigh House on 15 May 2019, bringing together a large number of interested and concerned stakeholders to discuss the Report of the Working Group and further developments.</p>  <p>  Work on revising the revised General Scheme of the Gambling Control Bill is underway in my Department. This is a complex area and we must be certain that any reforms will be achievable and effective. At the time of publication of the Working Group Report, An Taoiseach indicated that work on revising legislation, taking account of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, would likely take a period of about 18 months to bring to completion.</p>  <p>  Separately, I have brought forward the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019, an interim reform measure to amend the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act. I hope that Report Stage of the Bill can be scheduled in the House as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As recognised in Future Jobs, increasing female participation is a vital way to grow the diversity and strength of our indigenous business sector. </p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses. My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance. The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.  The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes. In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led. However, 22 per cent of HPSU approvals went to female-led companies in 2018 and 22% of CSF approvals were for companies led by female entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks. An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses. In 2018 the network of Local Enterprise Offices across the country provided training to 21,859 female entrepreneurs (an 18% increase on 2017 figures) and mentoring to 4,565 female entrepreneurs (an increase of 19% on 2017 figures).</p>  <p>  I am aware that the GEM Report for 2018 notes the rate of early stage entrepreneurial activity increased among women in Ireland in 2018 and remained stable for men. The rate of early stage entrepreneurial activity is well above European norm for both men and women in Ireland. In most countries more men than women are early stage entrepreneurs. The ratio in Ireland continues to narrow as more women become entrepreneurs (1.6:1). Ireland is now ranked 6th across Europe in this regard. The rate at which women aspire to start a business in Ireland also increased in 2018. The ratio of male to female owner-managers of established businesses is higher (1.8:1) than it is among early stage entrepreneurs (1.6:1), but the gap is narrowing as the female rate is increasing. </p>  <p>  To ensure we do everything to narrow this gap further, my Department and its Agencies continue to shine a light on the promotion of female entrepreneurship. I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review and bring forward a new Female Entrepreneurship Strategy by the end of this year.  </p>  <p>  Over the past number of months there has been wide ranging consultation undertaken with key stakeholders. An in-depth review of current research has been carried out through meeting female entrepreneurs at all stages of development via focus groups and one to one interview.</p>  <p>  The main challenges identified can be broadly categorised into three areas: </p>  <p>  - Pipeline (of future female entrepreneurs) </p>  <p>  - Female founded Start Ups (High Potential Start Ups)</p>  <p>  - Scaling of female led enterprises.</p>  <p>  In developing this new strategy, consideration is also being given to encompassing the broader entrepreneurship agenda, to target ambitious female led companies to scale in international markets as well as continuing to focus on increasing female founded HPSUs.</p>  <p>  Across Government, my Department is supporting the newly formed &ldquo;Balance for Better Business&rdquo; initiative, led by my colleague Minister Staunton. This initiative was launched in July this year and will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management. </p>  <p>  Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland.

The study also provides analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy and considers a range of possible Brexit scenarios.</p><p>This analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy action being taken &ndash; this of course, is not the case given the extent of mitigation actions being taken by Government and firms across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>All of the scenarios examined produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario. The scenarios considered reflected 4 of the possible outcomes from the future relationship &ndash; an EEA scenario, a Free Trade Agreement, a Customs Union, or a worst-case WTO scenario. </p><p>Regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit has a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p><p>The WTO scenario would have the most negative impact on the Irish economy.  However, the economy is still projected to grow even under such a scenario, by 2030 GDP is expected to be 7 per cent lower than would otherwise have been the case.  </p><p>An EEA-like scenario would be least harmful &ndash; GDP in 2030 being 2.8 per cent lower than if Brexit had not happened.</p><p>The Customs Union scenario is more damaging than the EEA scenario (with GDP estimated to be 4.3 per cent lower in 2030 than would otherwise be the case). This scenario would not remove all tariffs/quotas (i.e. some tariffs on agri-food products would remain) and does not make any provision for services access or ensure regulatory convergence. </p><p>The FTA scenario used in the model reflects the average of all existing EU FTAs. Resulting in GDP being 4.3 per cent below baseline in 2030. The more comprehensive an FTA that might be agreed between the EU and UK, the lower the loss in GDP. </p><p>Since the Copenhagen Report was finalised, negotiations have progressed. The Withdrawal Agreement and the Declaration on the Future Relationship texts agreed between the EU an UK ,and which are before the UK Parliament  at present, anticipate the conclusion of an ambitious Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Based on the type of relationship envisaged, my Department is currently working with Copenhagen Economics to update the previous modelling exercise, to take account of the parameters the Declaration sets out.</p><p>Of course, all of the specific provisions of an FTA will be a matter for detailed and complex negotiations between the Union and the UK, and we cannot be certain of the time this will take. </p><p>What we know is that while the Declaration aims to minimise the increase in trade costs resulting from Brexit, it acknowledges that there are constraints regarding how low this cost minimisation can go. </p><p>I expect the results of the current economic modelling work to be available early next year. </p></reply>

I understand fully how important an employer this company has been to the area and the role it has played in supporting jobs and enterprise in the Mid-West.  </p>  <p>  The IDA first learnt of the decision by the firm to cease operating in Shannon on 21 October. My Department was informed immediately afterwards by the Agency through the Early Warning System. We unfortunately had no other prior notice of the company&rsquo;s intentions. </p>  <p>  Our immediate concern was of course for the workers and families who stood to be impacted. We were therefore determined to act as swiftly as possible to address the closure and help mitigate, as much as possible, its consequences for the employees and the Shannon region. I also spoke with the CEO of the company on 22 October, who explained that the company&rsquo;s decision was irreversible. </p>  <p>  On 23 October I travelled to Shannon, together with Minister of State Breen, to convene a meeting of key stakeholders. This included representatives from the State&rsquo;s principal enterprise agencies, Government Departments, Clare County Council, Third Level institutions and the local business community. Our collective focus was to determine how best to respond and to assist those employees who would be impacted by the closure.  </p>  <p>  Following that meeting, an action plan was agreed with Molex to support the skill development needs of its workers and to help them find alternative employment. Many of those impacted have valuable skills and experience and the IDA, together with other stakeholders, will be drawing the attention of potential employers to their availability. The IDA will also be working separately to market the facility to prospective investors and to find new investment for the area.  </p>  <p>  Looking further ahead, we will need &ndash; as was collectively agreed at the stakeholder meeting &ndash; to ensure we create new opportunities across the wider Mid-West region that can help offset many of these job losses. The Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan &ndash; which was launched earlier this year &ndash; will be a critical tool in that respect. </p>  <p>  While the Molex closure undeniably represents a significant blow for Shannon and the wider area, it remains the case that the Mid-West is performing well in economic terms. The region has seen significant investment in the last three years and key employers include many large-scale manufacturing employers such as Beckton Dickinson, Edwards Lifesciences, Analog Devices, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Stryker and Zimmer. We are therefore optimistic that further new opportunities can be created for the area in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge, in this context, that the Molex closure is purely the result of a decision by the company to discontinue certain product lines that are manufactured in Ireland. It has nothing to do with the competitiveness of our economy or the skills of our workforce. The company has made that fully clear itself. </p></reply>

No. 110 of 2019, as made by the Minister for Finance, the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies (RBO) is the central repository of such information held by companies and industrial and provident societies.  </p><p>The RBO is a requirement of the EU&rsquo;s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (4AMLD) and is designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.  The purpose of collecting data on the beneficial owners of companies is to identify the natural persons who are the real owners/controllers of a company and make this data available to Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), state competent authorities, obliged entities and the general public in order to prevent the use of the European Union&rsquo;s financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing.  It is an EU requirement and part of larger efforts by Ireland internationally to combat money laundering, organised crime and terrorism.</p><p>The Department of Finance takes a lead role in the forming of national policy regarding negotiations at EU level on the introduction of Anti-Money Laundering legislation.  Irish policy is informed and assisted by the Private Sector Consultative Forum (PSCF), which provides an information-sharing framework for private sector stakeholders and designated persons to regularly engage with public agencies on all anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism issues.</p><p>Filing with the RBO is free and is a fully electronic process.  Full details on registration are provided on the RBO website at <i>www.rbo.gov.ie</i>, including &ldquo;how to&rdquo; guides and a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.  Enquiries can be submitted by e-mail, although I understand that 90% of enquiries received to date are already answered on the FAQ section.</p><p>Newly incorporated companies have a period of five months after the date of incorporation to file their beneficial ownership information.</p><p>In order to comply with the EU's Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, the Registrar of Beneficial Ownership is required to validate the data entered in the RBO in respect of each beneficial owner. This is to ensure that the natural person exists, is still alive and to avoid duplication on the Register. As part of the validation process, the Registrar compares the data filed with the RBO against the data registered with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) for that person, using an electronic interface. </p><p>Under Data Protection Regulations, the RBO does not have access to the personal details entered by the presenter and as such is not in a position to share personal information on potential beneficial owners and reasons for rejection of submissions. Nevertheless, common reasons for RBO submission rejection are listed on the RBO FAQ section and a contact point in DEASP is provided where companies can check the data held by DEASP for each beneficial owner so that they can enter matching data in the RBO.</p><p>The information that is required to be filed with the RBO in respect of each beneficial owner (who must be a natural person) is as follows: </p><p>- Forename and Surname;</p><p>- Date of birth;</p><p>- Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) except where a beneficial owner does not have a PPSN, in which case a Declaration as to Verification of Identity can be uploaded;</p><p>- Nationality; </p><p>- Residential address; </p><p>- A statement of the nature of the interest held by each beneficial owner (e.g. controlling shareholder);</p><p>- A statement of the extent of the interest held by each beneficial owner (e.g. controller of 26% of shares in company); </p><p>- The date on which each natural person was entered in the company's own register as a beneficial owner;</p><p>- The date of cessation as beneficial owner.</p><p>If, having exhausted all possible means, no natural persons are identified as beneficial owners, there shall be entered in the RBO the names and details of the natural person(s) who hold the position(s) of senior managing official(s) of the company/industrial and provident society. Relevant entities shall keep records of the actions taken to identify their beneficial owners.</p><p>The following details of the presenter making the entry in the RBO on behalf of the company are required, i.e. name, contact details and capacity in which they are filing.</p><p>Obligations under S.I. No. 110 of 2019 on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing are legally separate to company law requirements under the Companies Act 2014.</p><p>The 2014 Act consolidated all existing company law in Ireland providing a corporate legislative framework that reflects international best practice. The Act recognises the &lsquo;Think Small First&rsquo; principle by placing less onerous compliance and reporting requirements on SMEs facilitating the growth of new companies and associated employment.Nevertheless, limited liability itself is a concession by the State to business, and must therefore be tempered by robust regulation to protect creditors' interests and to ensure this concession is not abused.</p><p>Information on incorporation and filing requirements with the Companies Registration Office is available on the CRO website at <i></i>.  </p></reply>

Our primary concern remains supporting those who will be directly impacted by the job losses. That is why every form of state assistance will be made available to the firm&rsquo;s employees.</p>  <p>  Whilst it does not change the fact that valuable jobs will be lost, it&rsquo;s important to note that the redundancies at the Novartis firms will take place over the next three years: 60 in 2020, 80 in 2021 and 180 in 2022. That does at least provide time in which intensive efforts will be made to offset some of these future job losses through the creation of new employment opportunities in the Ringaskiddy and Carrigaline areas. It is also the case that the employees affected have highly sought-after skills and experience in the competitive pharmaceutical industry. Given the industry&rsquo;s significant presence in Ireland, and its particular footprint in the wider Cork area, we can be hopeful that many of those who will be made redundant should be able to quickly find similar high-quality jobs in the same industry.</p>  <p>  As regards State engagement with Novartis itself, IDA Ireland has a close working relationship with the firm, as it does with the vast majority of its client companies. I understand that officials from the Agency had several meetings this year, both in Cork and abroad, with Novartis management. The IDA was therefore both aware that the company was examining the efficiency of its global manufacturing network and that its facility in Ringaskiddy was operating below capacity. Accordingly, the Agency engaged with Novartis to support and safeguard its future presence here, in a similar way to how it regularly works with its clients all over Ireland to help grow their business and employment numbers in the country.  </p>  <p>  However, whilst there was an awareness of under-capacity at the facility in Ringaskiddy, the first the IDA learnt of the company&rsquo;s intention to make any employees redundant was on 22 October. Once that information was provided by the company to the IDA that evening, the Agency relayed it to myself and my Department through an early warning report. We unfortunately did not have any other prior notice of potential job losses at the company. </p>  <p>  I subsequently spoke directly with the company&rsquo;s management. I made it clear that the Irish Government very much regretted its decision. IDA officials also held separate meetings with Novartis since the announcement, with both its management in Ringaskiddy and in Basel, Switzerland. </p>  <p>  As I have said, our focus now is supporting the impacted employees and their families. Key State supports include the Intreo service, operated by the Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection. That will help advise employees on entitlements and protections, as well as on re-training and education options. The IDA will be working hard, with both its existing clients in the area but also with prospective investors, to create new jobs in the area.</p>  <p>  While it is difficult to be positive so soon after an announcement of redundancies, the reality is that Cork &ndash; including the strong biopharmaceutical industry there &ndash; has performed strongly in foreign direct investment terms in recent years. Nearly 15,000 net new jobs have been created by IDA clients there over the last nine years. That trend looks set to continue and therefore provides grounds for optimism that new jobs can soon be created to replace those that will be unfortunately lost at Novartis. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.995.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500076#WRS04500"><p>The recent job losses announced in Counties and Cork are very disappointing.  However, these announcements are not a reflection of the strength or competitiveness of our economy. It is important to recognise that the overall trend of employment and investment continues to be very positive &ndash; in Clare, in Cork, in Munster and in Ireland as a whole &ndash; and there have been a number of significant investments in 2019 across all regions. In fact, there are now over 230,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies &ndash; the highest-ever figure &ndash; and last year alone IDA Ireland won 265 projects, compared with 237 in 2017. </p>  <p>  Retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) remains fundamentally important to our economic model. That is why IDA Ireland continues to work closely with international clients, from a range of sectors, to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms, often in the face of increasing international competition for high-value investment projects.</p>  <p>  In doing so, the IDA has targeted both new-name investors and increased investment from companies already located here. The Agency has also restructured its global footprint in response to Brexit and other global challenges. This expansion of the IDA&rsquo;s presence overseas has allowed IDA&rsquo;s staff to secure new investment opportunities from non-traditional target markets and to further diversify our sources of investment. </p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is as competitive as possible. We are conscious of the areas in which we need to improve, including increasing the availability of certain labour market skills and investing further in infrastructure through Project Ireland 2040. We have also introduced Future Jobs Ireland, a cross-government initiative with a strong focus on improving productivity. One of the key features of Future Jobs is developing an awareness of the importance of lifelong learning and continuous training and upskilling. That means when economic patterns shift, businesses and workers alike are better able to adapt and evolve.  </p>  <p>  Our efforts to win more FDI will be helped by our continued status as an attractive destination with a proven track record as a successful home for overseas firms. Of course, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union ensures that companies considering investment here will gain barrier-free access to the EU market. When taken together with other strengths, such as our pro-enterprise environment and our highly skilled dynamic workforce, I am confident that Ireland will continue to be an attractive destination for FDI in the years ahead. </p></reply>

Support and advice is also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and Failte Ireland.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan Update (July 2019), the Government has made provision on a precautionary basis for two changes to the operation of the Vat Retail Export Scheme in the Brexit Omnibus Act. This is a contingency measure as it is anticipated that a solution to such matters will form part of a future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  The Retail Export Scheme is under the aegis of the Department of Finance, and to date has not been discussed at the Retail Consultation Forum.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage with the retail sector in their preparation for Brexit through the Retail Consultation Forum. </p></reply>

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. </p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which can offer benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key deliverables under Pillar 4 with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. These include deliverables such as holding a national consultation on flexible working options, the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave. </p>  <p>  A further deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider related policies abroad, such as the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo; in France, in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working.</p>  <p>  This research will include desk research, a national employee survey, and key stakeholder engagement. In order to aid this engagement, I held a Remote Working Stakeholder Forum in Cavan Digital Hub on July 18th. The results arising from this event will be included in the final research.</p>  <p>  The research will be completed in Q4 of this year and will be published shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and we have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Our aim remains to increase this percentage further by the end of this year. </p><p>When it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), site visits do represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.

The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is charged with overseeing and standardising procurement processes and procedures throughout the public service. </p>  <p>  My Department has a dedicated Procurement Co-ordination Unit, headed at Principal Officer level, which provides an advisory service and advocates best practice on public procurement matters internally to all business units. Each business unit is responsible for its own procurement of goods and services. A significant proportion of the Department&rsquo;s procurement is undertaken via centralised framework arrangements put in place by the OGP.  </p>  <p>  Procurement also features prominently as part of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s (C&amp;AG) annual audit of my Department&rsquo;s Vote. In addition, the Department&rsquo;s own Internal Audit Unit, also periodically conduct procurement audits, the most recent one being completed this summer.   </p>  <p>  In any given year there will always be certain circumstances where a full procurement process cannot be conducted. Typically, such instances are where:   </p>  <p>  - The provision of the required service can only be sourced from a sole supplier e.g. ICT software licenses and/or support;</p>  <p>  - Specialist expertise is needed e.g. certain legal or translation services;</p>  <p>  - A timing issue arises as the Department or its Offices await new OGP framework agreement(s) to be finalised for certain goods or services. In such cases, the Department or its Offices, typically have no option but to undertake a short-term extension to an existing contract until the OGP framework is in place.   </p>  <p>  All such instances are brought to the attention of the C&amp;AG in line with Department of Finance Circular 40/2002 and as part of the Department&rsquo;s annual Appropriation Account. This process involves signoff by the Principal Officer responsible for the Procurement Co-Ordination Unit and also the Secretary General in her role as Accounting Officer. The 2017 and 2018 Appropriation Accounts have been certified by the C&amp;AG. Preparations for the 2019 Appropriation Account have recently commenced. </p>  <p>   The C&amp;AG noted that in 2017 there were 8 instances of short-term contract extensions where it was not possible to undertake a full procurement process.  The related in-year expenditure totalled &euro;365,000. The services contracted for included cleaning, offsite file storage, office stationery, translation costs, specialist consultancy and legal expertise. In addition, services were provided by six sole suppliers covering ICT licenses and support, telephony services and specialist publications. The related in-year expenditure to sole suppliers totalled &euro;661,000. </p>  <p>  In 2018 there were four instances of short-term contract extensions where it was not possible to conduct a full procurement process and these involved in-year expenditure of &euro;310,00. The services procured covered security, translation and specialist consultancy services. In addition, services were provided by six sole suppliers covering ICT licenses and support, telephony, room hire and specialist publications. The related in-year expenditure to sole suppliers totalled &euro;615,000. </p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p>  <p>  As at 28 October 2019, there have been 869 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 779 have been approved. There have been 156 repeat applications, as eligibility under the scheme expires after six months. To date, 207 applications have progressed to sanction at finance provider level, to a total value of &euro;45.5 million.</p></reply>

Attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI), and supporting the growth and expansion of overseas firms already located here, is an important part of that. There are currently over 230,000 people employed in companies that are supported by IDA Ireland, a number which we are working hard to increase further. </p>  <p>  In addition to the general support that it provides to client firms through advice and expertise on investing in Ireland, the IDA is authorised by my Department to provide a range of particular financial supports in the form of employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants. These grants represent an important means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations. </p>  <p>  In 2018, IDA Ireland paid a total of &euro;91,046,527 in grants to its client companies. Grant payments however, are not necessarily linked to either the investments won, or the jobs created in a 12-month period. Grants are generally drawn down over the lifetime of a project which is normally over a period of three to five years. Some investments which result in job creation may not be grant aided and some well-established companies may no longer be receiving grant payments. It is therefore very difficult to determine the precise number of jobs created in 2018 and to date in 2019 that are attribute to grant payments.</p></reply>

Therefore, year to date employment figures for 2019 are not available.</p>  <p>  Support to client companies is tailored to meet the individual needs of each client company in order to equip them to succeed in global markets.

Year on year they have grown their client numbers and increased the job creation in communities across the country. The LEOs are central to the continued growth of small businesses and the success of budding and future entrepreneurs. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business. The 31 LEOs nationwide are operated in partnership with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities. They provide expert training, mentoring and financial assistance to entrepreneurs and small businesses who may want to start, develop or grow their company.</p><p>In 2018, the LEOs supported 36,666 people employed in 7,164 LEO client companies throughout the country. There were 3,656 new jobs created by LEO-supported companies in 2018, with an 11 per cent increase in employment in companies in the LEO portfolio last year. The 2019 LEO performance outcomes will not be known until completion of the annual employment survey of LEO clients in Q1 2020.</p><p>The LEOs publish an impact report annually, which includes details of employment performance and other key metrics and the LEO Impact Report 2018 can be found through the link below.</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The meeting I convened in Shannon with representatives of the State's enterprise agencies and other key stakeholders was an important first step in responding to the Molex announcement. I will also be working closely with regional stakeholders in Cork through the Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee for the South-West to ensure that we can help the workers affected by the announcement from Novartis. </p>  <p>  Our main priority, in both cases, is assisting those impacted find new employment opportunities. The Mid-West and South-West Regional Enterprise Plans &ndash; which I launched earlier this year &ndash; will be critical tools in that respect. These are designed to support the growth of business in the regions and their implementation will help to create quality new jobs. </p>  <p>  Similarly, the IDA is already working hard to identify potential new investors for Clare and Cork. With respect to the former, the Agency will be marketing the Molex building to overseas firms for when the company ceases operating there. As for the latter, the planned redundancies do not take full effect until 2022 so there is at least time for intensive efforts to be taken to identify potential new investment for the area. </p>  <p>  It is worth emphasising that the overall trend of employment and investment continues to be positive for both regions. The Mid-West region saw 1,000 net new jobs added by IDA Ireland client companies in 2018. The region has witnessed significant investment as well over the last three years and key employers in the region include many large-scale manufacturing employers such as Beckton Dickinson, Edwards Lifesciences, Analog Devices, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Stryker and Zimmer. The South-West region also continues to be a very strong performer in attracting foreign direct investment, with almost 2,200 net new jobs added by multinational companies in 2018. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.1072.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500078#WRU01000"><p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims, including claims in respect of clinical negligence, on behalf of Delegated State Authorities (DSA&rsquo;s), including the Health Service Executive. </p><p>On a point of clarity, while the Deputy's question does reference late diagnosis and missed diagnosis, it is important to note that a screening test is not a diagnostic test. Cervical screening aims to prevent cervical cancer through the early detection and treatment of pre-cancerous changes on the cervix. Earlier detection can often increase treatment options, as well as reduce the invasiveness of that treatment. It is estimated that regular cervical screening can prevent 75% (or 3 out of 4) of cervical cancer cases. Since 2008, 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck. More than 50,000 women with high grade abnormalities (CIN 2 &amp;amp; 3) have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer. CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland - these dropped from around 14 per 100,000 in the period 2009-2011 to 10 per 100,000 in the period 2013-2015.  Cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer, and some women will still develop cervical cancer despite regular screening.</p><p>Also, to clarify the Deputy's reference to failings in the cervical cancer screening programme, it should be noted that the Report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, conducted by Dr Gabriel Scally, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected.  However, Dr Scally was clear in his Final Report, published September 2018, that the Inquiry was satisfied with the quality management processes in the labs contracted by CervicalCheck. </p><p>His report presented no evidence that either the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme.  He confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.</p><p>The SCA has provided me with the information set out below in relation to the Deputy's question. This information is correct as at 30 October 2019.</p><p><b>Response from State Claims Agency:</b></p><p>The information contained within this report has been extracted from the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and is as at 30th October 2019.</p><p><b>1. Number of Claims on hand</b></p><p>There are currently 125 claims relating to allegations of misinterpretation by the National Screening Service under active management by the State Claims Agency.</p><p><b>2. Number of Claims Settled</b></p><p>To date the SCA has settled 8 of these claims.</p><p><b>3. Amount paid out in claims to date</b></p><p>Due to the low number of claims, this figure is not published as it could lead to the identification of an individual.</p><p><b>4. Legal costs of the cases</b></p><p>In respect of all associated National Screening Services cases, legal costs amounting to &euro;1,498,426 have been paid. These legal costs include fees paid to mediation services, which is consistent with the SCA&rsquo;s policy of using mediation wherever possible to resolve these claims in a non-adversarial manner. These legal fees also include matters not relating to the areas in which the State has already accepted liability. It is anticipated that much of the work carried out in respect of these initial cases, and by extension the fees incurred, will be applied in resolving future cases that have been notified to the SCA and that this work will not need to be repeated in managing these future cases.</p></reply>

The implementation of genomic medicine in routine clinical care &ndash; often referred to as &lsquo;personalised&rsquo;, &lsquo;precision&rsquo; or &lsquo;stratified&rsquo; medicine &ndash; requires careful and comprehensive planning due to a range of scientific and social challenges. These include issues such as test reliability and validity, cost-effectiveness, health system and workforce readiness, and regulatory and ethical concerns. The application of genomic medicine is a relatively new and cutting-edge field; there are already some therapies in place, and considerable research being undertaken globally, to fully explore its potential applications. </p>  <p>  Ireland is well placed for use of genomic medicine; with a relatively homogenous population, this provides opportunities to combine genetic information and health data. Ireland has a strong tradition of investing in genetic and genomic research through the Health Research Board, the Higher Education Authority and Science Foundation Ireland.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Donnai and Newman Report commissioned by the HSE, recommended improvements in the governance, management and future development of genetic services. The 2016 Smith Report (Report of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network Strategy Group) reviewed the Donnai and Newman Report and made recommendations for the next steps. On foot of these, in 2018 Acute Operations received new service development funding to begin the process of establishing a National Genetics and Genomics Medicine Network (NGGMN); to bring together all parties within the field of genomic medicine for multi-disciplinary working in a national clinical and research centre. The NGGMN will build the effective governance arrangements that recognises the interdependence between corporate, financial and clinical governance across the service and integrate them to deliver high quality, safe and reliable healthcare.  Development of this NGGMN will be a joint initiative between Acute Operations and the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer and the recruitment process for a clinical lead is at an advanced stage. </p>  <p>  As genomics is a new area of medicine, it is not possible to calculate how many patients might benefit, however it is likely that the specialisms of cancer, and rare diseases will be the among the first fields to benefit from advancements in genomics medicine. However, the demand for genetic assessment and testing is growing rapidly, due primarily to an increased awareness among the public and among health care professionals.  </p>  <p>  Many rare diseases are genetic in origin and, as such, effective genetic services can have an important role to play in relation to diagnosis and possible treatment. The medical genetics service in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provides services for patients and families affected by, or at risk of, a genetic disorder.  It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, provided additional resources last year to support the hospital&rsquo;s Department of Clinical Genetics.  Investments in staff and equipment to further develop the service is continuing.</p>  <p>  The National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026 highlighted the growing role of cancer genetics in cancer prevention and cancer care. The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is working closely with clinical genetics and cancer genetics services in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin and St James&rsquo;s Hospital to develop the services to meet the growing need.  Under the strategy, investments have been made in genetic counsellor, consultant and support positions, as well as cancer genetic testing.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the significant opportunities and benefits afforded by genetic and genomic research, and in this regard, there are currently discussions underway with my officials. A key objective is to ensure that Ireland develops a comprehensive national policy/strategy, in consultation with stakeholders, which ensures that we both respond to these opportunities and overcome the not insignificant challenges of implementing a genomic medicine programme in a health service delivery context.</p>  <p>  Regarding the provision of training for genetic services, as this is a service matter and I have asked the HSE to consider and respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, the company must submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it has received a number of applications for the reimbursement of Nivolumab (Opdivo). Some of these have already been approved for reimbursement, including applications for the following indications:</p>  <p>  - As monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults</p>  <p>  - In combination with ipilimumab, indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults</p>  <p>  The HSE has received an application for the reimbursement of Nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection.</p>  <p>  In respect of this indication, a health technology assessment was completed on 13 October 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Nivolumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. The HSE will assess this application for reimbursement in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  In March 2019, the VHI sent a circular to Oncologists advising them that it was extending cover to a number of new cancer medicines.  The decision by the VHI applies only to private care to private VHI patients in private hospitals.  It has no impact on the availability and use of medicines in public hospitals, where there is no distinction between public and private patients.</p>  <p>  The effect of the VHI decision is that VHI private patients in private hospitals may have access to a medicine that is not yet available in the public hospital system. However, a number of the medicines, or indications, which the VHI has now decided to cover, are at various stages of the HSE assessment and reimbursement process with a view to making them available in the public hospital system.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p><p>Participants in the Scheme contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 7.5% per annum of the value of assets held. In the case of a couple, the applicant&rsquo;s means are assessed as 50% of the couple&rsquo;s combined income and assets. The first &euro;36,000 of an individual&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, is not counted at all in the financial assessment. The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap.</p><p>The Financial assessment takes into account any income or assets transferred by the person whose means are being assessed if the transfer occurred within 5 years of the date of first application for State support.</p></reply>

Section 13 of the Act deals with applications for review of a medical opinion, and provides that where a medical practitioner has not given an opinion or has not given an opinion which would certify a procedure being carried out under section 9 or 11, he/she must inform the pregnant woman in writing that she or a person acting on her behalf may apply for a review of this decision.  </p>  <p>  Section 23 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 sets out the offences under the legislation.  The investigation or prosecution of offences under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 are criminal matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, if prosecution is warranted, the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Minister for Health has no role in the investigation or prosecution of offences under the Act.</p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced. There has also been a huge expansion in the number of training places on GP training programmes in recent years; up from 120 places in 2009 to 192 filled in 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition, the recent Agreement on GP contractual reforms will benefit patients and GPs.  In return for cooperation with a range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) over the next four years.  This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme.</p>  <p>  There will be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments. I am confident that these measures help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p>  <p>  There is also a need, in the Government&rsquo;s view, for a longer-term strategic review of how general practice should operate within the health service, well into the future. Therefore, during the lifetime of this Agreement my Department will lead a strategic review of general practice with a view to developing a new contractual framework which best supports patients and encourages innovation in primary care. This will be a wide-ranging task and it will, I hope, enable further innovative measures to be developed for the benefit of citizens and of course for GPs.</p>  <p>  In relation to GP availability in mid-County Louth, as this is a service issue I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

As you are aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy contain commitments to expanding the role of community pharmacy in managing patient health in the community.</p>  <p>  Work has been done in recent years on wider healthcare roles for pharmacies, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s Future Pharmacy report, on the expansion of professional pharmacy practice. It is clear from this and other work that there is potential to increase the range of both private and publicly funded health services delivered through community pharmacy. Important new services, such as influenza vaccination and emergency contraception, have already been introduced.</p>  <p>  To be funded by the taxpayer, new public health services in community pharmacy, as elsewhere, should improve health outcomes and provide value for money and benefits for patients. Any new or transferred services should be based on sound evidence, with matching improvements in governance and administration.</p>  <p>  I have discussed these and other issues with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU). My officials will be engaging with the IPU on new fee regulations before the end of the year and the intention is to broaden the discussions to contractual and service arrangements during 2020.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This came into operation in July 2011. </p>  <p>  This policy now incorporates parental consent for the primary use of screening (a baby) for 8 rare conditions. The policy also allows the card to be retained for a specific period of 10 years before disposal. Any secondary use (including research) requires additional and explicit parental consent for that specific secondary use. </p>  <p>  A decision in relation to the archive of blood spot screening cards retained without consent (1984-June 2011) is well advanced.  There are a number of component parts to be factored in when coming to a reasonable, fair and balanced decision. Firstly we must acknowledge the significant initiatives that have been completed including the public information campaign in 2013 offering individuals the opportunity to request and have their card returned to them and secondly the deliberations and report of the Forum held in 2016. </p>  <p>  We have all learned a lot about the complexities of screening programmes over the last 18 months and the importance of public trust. That is now, for me, the most important influencing factor and as such the decision in relation to the archive must be one that protects the future uptake, integrity and confidence in the national newborn bloodspot screening programme,  a screening programme with a 99.9% uptake.  The decision must also balance the right to privacy with the principle of consent and ensure we seal the breach of national and EU Data Protection Regulations. </p></reply>

This identifier would enable the Central Statistics Office to identify ethnic and minority groups, including Travellers, when collating statistics, including those in relation to deaths due to suicide and could be utilised in the statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office. </p>  <p>  The requirements for the registration of particulars of a death are set down on the Civil Registration Acts 2004 and 2019.</p>  <p>  Section 41 of the 2004 Act, as amended, states that a coroner must furnish a certificate containing particulars of death to a registrar. These particulars include name and place of birth of deceased,country of citizenship.  However, there is no current requirement to enter particulars in regard to ethnicity.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality published the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017&ndash;2021 in June 2017. This Inclusion Strategy is a cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  One of the key initiatives from the Strategy's themes and objectives is the introduction of a new system of ethnic identifiers to be developed across the public sector to help track progress and/or challenges for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality chair a cross-Departmental working group, with involvement from Traveller and Roma representatives, with a view to developing a methodology for the introduction of an ethnic identifier on all data sets to facilitate the monitoring of access, participation and outcomes to services for Travellers and Roma.</p>  <p>  The Integration Data Mapping Study commissioned by the working group has now been completed by the ESRI. Many of the findings and recommendations, while focused on integration of migrants, are relevant to the Strategy's commitment. The report was published in March and is available on the ESRI website. The Integration Data working group has yet to meet again and it is hoped to reconvene the Ethnic Identifier subgroup next year.</p>  <p>  When the methodology has been progressed, the HSE and other relevant bodies, in consultation with Traveller organisations and other stakeholders, will work towards a phased, incremental implementation of the standardised ethnic identifier across all health administrative systems to monitor access, participation and outcomes of all groups, including Travellers and Roma, and to inform the development of evidenced-based policies and services.</p>  <p>  As part of this wider health initiative, the HSE will review the access and barriers to primary and secondary mental health services for Travellers and Roma, in the context of the implementation of the ethnic identifier, and in partnership with Traveller and Roma service users, carers and families in order to develop and implement appropriate steps to ensure greater inclusion and continued use of these services by Travellers and Roma.</p></reply>

The Traveller community is among a number of priority groups identified in these strategies, acknowledging that, while Travellers are eligible to avail of all mainstream public health services, they also have specific needs and mental health services should be delivered in a culturally-appropriate way.</p><p>For this reason, in 2017 the HSE committed to the recruitment of nine Mental Health Coordinators for Travellers, eight of whom are currently in post. The focus of these roles is to work within the CHOs to support improved access, consistency and integration of mental health services to meet the mental health needs of Travellers. </p><p>The Department of Health also provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum, through the HSE, for targeted measures to improve the health status of the Travelling community.  These include:</p><p>- primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff; and</p><p>- mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.</p><p>In addition, the Department of Justice and Equality's National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy also details HSE-specific actions. Of particular note is the commitment by the HSE to develop a National Traveller Health Action Plan. </p><p>The HSE circulated a first draft of the action plan in March 2019 for consultation with stakeholders, including the Department of Health. The draft is currently being revised to take account of feedback and is expected to be finalised in quarter 4 2019.</p></reply>

The number of HCA staff employed in the public system, has risen by +342 WTEs this year to date, and has risen overall by +584 WTEs when compared to the same period last year.  Publicly employed HCA staffing levels at end September 2019 stand at 17,433 WTEs. </p>  <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovations (DBEI) have responsibility for the employment permits list for in-demand occupations (the highly skilled list) and the list for those for whom a ready source of labour is available (the ineligible list).

Removal of occupations from the list involves an evidenced based review by the Expert Group on Future Skills Need. The parent Department, in this case the Department of Health, must support any submission for it to be considered during this review.  Officials from my Department have assessed submissions in relation to the removal of Health Care Assistants from this list but did not find that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages but rather that other factors such as salary and/or working conditions were a factor.  As such, the removal of care workers from the ineligible list has not been supported by the my Department up to now.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>   In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>   During the 2019/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.  It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>   As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:  </p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection; </p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPVvaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

Meetings took place in February, May and September of this year. Quarterly meetings with this important stakeholder will continue, to take place to ensure that their input and the voice of the patient is represented. The Department of Health also meets regularly with the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the National Rare Disease Office to monitor progress.</p>  <p>  Many rare diseases are genetic in origin and, as such, effective genetic services can have an important role to play in relation to diagnosis and possible treatment. The medical genetics service in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin provides services for patients and families affected by, or at risk of, a genetic disorder.  It comprises three integrated units: a clinical genetics service; a cytogenetics laboratory and a molecular genetics laboratory. Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, provided additional resources last year to support the hospital&rsquo;s Department of Clinical Genetics.  An external multi professional team, led by an experienced NHS UK Health Manager, has been assisting in the improvement of the service.  Investments in staff and equipment to further develop the service is continuing.</p>  <p>  The Minister, and the 10-year strategy for transforming healthcare in Ireland, Sl&aacute;intecare, acknowledges the fundamental importance of research in delivering high quality and informed services based on robust data and rigorous research. Clinical trials, in particular, are at the heart of improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. International evidence clearly shows that standards of care are higher in research-active healthcare organisations, and this results in greater access to innovative treatments and improved outcomes for patients. In addition, this improves the recruitment and retention of high calibre staff into the health service and attracts industrial collaboration and jobs. For this reason, the Department of Health, via the Health Research Board, has invested over &euro;150m in clinical research infrastructure and supports over the last decade. This has resulted in the establishment of state-of-the-art clinical research facilities on the campuses of hospitals, clinical trials networks to support the conduct of multi-centre trials, a Trials Methodology Research Network (HRB-TMRN) to support the development of methodological skills in trials and intervention research and Clinical Research Coordination Ireland (HRB-CRCI) to act as a one-stop-shop for all those interested in the conduct of multi-site clinical trials in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As a further sign of his commitment to clinical research and his ambition to increase the trial footprint in Ireland, the Minister recently secured government approval to become a member of the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN). By managing and supporting trials across borders, connecting networks, and advising and implementing policy, it advances knowledge flow, competitiveness and integration in European clinical research. As a member, Ireland&rsquo;s clinical trial researchers will now have access to a wider patient base and diversity, expertise from across Europe and potential cost savings through resource sharing with other member states. Membership of ECRIN will also increase the ability of people in Ireland to be part of research on rare conditions and to benefit from breakthroughs as ECRIN represents a population of 300 million, giving access to much larger trials than could be delivered in Ireland alone. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 330 clinical investigators in Ireland leading and undertaking trials across the clinical trials infrastructure mentioned above. To ensure that we are pro-actively and constantly developing the future cadre of clinician and non-clinician clinical research investigators, the HRB has an expansive portfolio of early-, mid- and senior career investigator awards and fellowships. The HRB has also introduced a dedicated funding stream in recent years to fund clinical trials and intervention studies.</p>  <p>  Finally, one of the most long-standing barriers to the conduct of seamless and efficient clinical trials in Ireland is our current system of Research Ethics approval. In July this year, the Minister secured approval for a National Research Ethics Committee Bill. The establishment of a National Office for Research Ethics Committees, and the urgent establishment of a National Research Ethics Committee in the area of Clinical Trials (of Medicinal Products), will deliver an effective and coherent national model which will benefit those conducting and participating in trials.</p>  <p>  The Minister is aware of the significant opportunities and benefits afforded by genetic and genomic research. The key objective for the Department, and the Minister, is to ensure that Ireland develops a comprehensive national policy/strategy which ensures that we both respond to these opportunities and overcome the not insignificant challenges of implementing a genomic medicine programme in a health service delivery context. </p>  <p>  The ultimate goal is for genomic medicine to benefit individuals, the healthcare system and society. In 2016 Professor Owen Smith authored the &lsquo;Report of the National Genetic and Genomic Medicine Network Strategy Group&rsquo;. On foot of the recommendations outlined in this report, in 2018 the HSE received new service development funding to begin the process of establishing a National Genetics and Genomics Medicine Network. The aim of this Network, once established, is that it would build the effective governance arrangements that recognises the interdependence between corporate, financial and clinical governance across the service and integrate them to deliver high quality, safe and reliable healthcare. Discussions are at an advanced stage to initiate the recruitment of a National Director of this Network.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2018,</i>which was published in September, has estimated that poor air quality causes up to 1,180 premature deaths per annum in Ireland.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has a priority to identify and advise the general public on strategies to reduce their risk of adverse effects during episodes of poor air quality.  To this end, the HSE and the EPA established a collaboration to look at the relationship between short-term changes in ambient air quality and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Dublin city and county between 2014 and 2018.  The Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH) was the measure used for ambient air quality (Available URL:<i>)</i>.  The preliminary findings from this work have highlighted that the ambient air quality in Dublin is predominantly good (i.e. Good: 96%; Fair: 3%; Poor: 1%; and Very poor: &amp;lt; 1%).  Other findings are comparable to reports within the literature, but uniquely show the Irish experience.  The report is currently being finalised for publication.</p><p>Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. However, my Department has been advised by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal to expand the smoky coal ban nationally. This is particularly disappointing, given the impact poor air quality can have on human health and the environment and the emphasis the Government is putting on transitioning to a low carbon society.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, is in contact with the Attorney General on this matter. </p><p>The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and I engage on a regular basis.</p></reply>

Pay restoration for these bodies commenced in April of this year with further payments due in 2020 and 2021 as appropriate. </p><p>The WRC agreement also states:</p><p><i>&ldquo;It is recognised that some of the remaining Section 39 organisations (estimated 250 approximately) are likely to have pay restoration issues and a process to address these will be agreed and the parties will commence engagement on this issue during 2019&rdquo;</i></p><p>L'Arche Ireland Kilkenny is one of these remaining organisations.  There have been initial engagements in recent months between the parties on this matter under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  It has been acknowledged by management that the resources available to deliver on this initiative will be a significant challenge for the HSE.  It is also recognised that significant preparatory work will be required to determine the exact costs for pay restoration to this wider group.</p><p>The parties are currently reflecting on their positions following the most recent WRC engagement.</p></reply>

Each nuclear medicine department has been requested to contact the NCCP on a daily basis during the Brexit period to inform on how their service is running and to highlight any Brexit-related issues.

Results from the pilot were positive for both patients and staff.  Showing evidence of improvements in the quality of care and patient outcomes, and a reduction in length of stay. The Framework also stabilised the workforce, improving staff moral and a leading to a reduction in agency spend.</p>  <p>  The national rollout of the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings is now the responsibility of the HSE and a National Implementation structure has been agreed. Full rollout is dependent on the introduction of a new ICT system which is now in the final stages of procurement.</p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to write to the Deputy directly to provide to provide further information on its implementation plan, together with the costs and benefits of same.</p></reply>

The Department's approach therefore is, before formulating legislation, to undertake the required detailed policy and evidence base development work including appropriate legal research, policy research, public and stakeholder consultation and resource implications analysis. </p><p>Evidence base development and policy drafting is progressing well.  A high-level Steering Group established to assist my Department in its development of the policy, has held five meetings to date and there has been ongoing stakeholder consultation. Updates and related papers such as discussion papers on the policy content are published regularly on my Department's website. Focus group consultation is being undertaken to ensure that voices of the most directly affected service users are heard and a research evidence project to inform the policy is in train.  Major project milestones to date include: </p><p>- Government approval to develop the national health sector policy; </p><p>- a stakeholder survey on the themes and questions to be covered in the policy;  </p><p>- formation of the Steering Group assisting in my Department's development of the policy; </p><p>- commissioning of a research evidence project to inform the policy; </p><p>- commencement of service user focus group consultation (in partnership with the Institute of Public Health) to ensure the voices of those most directly affected are heard; </p><p>- further ongoing stakeholder consultation, for example meetings with key stakeholders including the HSE National Safeguarding Office, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission, Safeguarding Ireland, Sage Advocacy and others; frontline site visits and fact-finding visits by Departmental officials; and a major stakeholder consultation workshop on policy content;  </p><p>- detailed drafting throughout 2019.</p><p>Related major milestones in relation to adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector include: </p><p>- my recent approval of national standards for adult safeguarding submitted to me jointly by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission; </p><p>- the anticipated early finalisation of a major revision by the Health Service Executive of its national operational adult safeguarding policy.  </p><p>Arrangements for the early launch and publication of the new adult safeguarding standards are being finalised.  Both the standards and the revised operational policy will be very important in informing the Department&rsquo;s development of the national health sector policy and identifying possible policy or legislative gaps.</p><p>A further significant initiative across all sectors was the Law Reform Commission's commencement in June 2019 of a legal research project on &quot;A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding&quot;, on foot of submissions from various bodies, including from my Department.</p><p>It is hoped that a first draft health sector policy will be completed during the first quarter of 2020, and that a public consultation on a published draft policy will be undertaken as soon as possible thereafter. Following analysis and consideration of the feedback obtained through the consultation process the draft policy will be further developed and proposals on the policy will be submitted to Government thereafter. </p></reply>

There was an average of 707 available inpatient beds and 112 available day case beds in St James' Hospital year to date in July 2019.</p><p>The Health Service Capacity Review published last year highlighted the need for a major investment in additional capacity.

This anomaly was also raised with me in the course of a meeting with the Medical Council earlier this year. </p>  <p>  A new service model for public health is being developed at present. My Department is engaged with the HSE in developing this model in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare; and also taking into account the recommendations of Dr Gabriel Scally in his Report into CervicalCheck concerning the future role and status of public health medicine and public health specialists. The recommendations in the Crowe Horwath Report concerning the role, training and career structures of Public Health Physicians are also being taken into account. </p>  <p>  Consultant status is being addressed as part of this process. It is intended that Public Health Specialists will to be given consultant status when the new framework has been settled and is being implemented in 2020 and beyond. The issue is also being progressed in parallel engagement between my Department, the HSE and the IMO, in the context of the development of the new framework. It is intended that the agreed Consultant Contract will encompass the key roles and functions referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Since 2010, the Health Research Board (HRB), the primary agency for disbursement of research funding from my Department, has invested &euro;1.78 million in research related to MS. This has included research on potential treatments, supports for carers of people with MS, causes of MS, enhancement of physical activity and prevention of falls among people with MS, and improving cognition and daily function for people with MS. Currently, the HRB have commitments of &euro;760,000 for MS-specific research. One of these awards includes a co-funded award with MS Ireland through the Medical Research Charities Group with a total value of &euro;166,000. Since 2010, a further &euro;4 million has been invested on research into the aetiology of neurodegeneration more broadly and the most appropriate approach to services.</p>  <p>  HRB funding schemes are open calls that are internationally peer-reviewed; funding is not hypothecated for specific conditions, rather to ensure value for public monies it is the quality of the application that is the primary focus of review. </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the primary childhood immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against disease.  Measles is an acute and serious infection caused by the measles virus and is highly infectious.  It is a notifiable disease (under Infectious Disease legislation) and all cases are reported to Departments of Public Health within the HSE.  Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended by NIAC &ndash; one dose at 12 months of age and a second booster dose when your child is 4/5 years of age. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that vaccine hesitancy is not unique to Ireland.  It is a global issue and has been identified by the World Health Organisation as one of the ten leading threats to global health in 2019.</p>  <p>  One of my priorities as Minister for Health is to increase vaccination rates across the country and several options in this area are being explored.  In this regard, I launched the Vaccine Alliance in September.  Its aim is to increase the uptake of childhood vaccines and reduce vaccine hesitancy.  The group includes a wide range of organisations and further organisations will be added once the terms of reference, key target audiences, and priorities for the Vaccine Alliance have been agreed.</p></reply>

The Report provides an analysis of the current situation and outlines the work undertaken by the project team to date. It identified 153 consultants employed in the HSE who were not on the Specialist Division of the Register (February 2019 data), 46 of whom were employed prior to the introduction of the requirement for specialist registration in 2008; and 107 employed after the introduction of this requirement. Of those appointed prior to the 2008 policy change 40 were properly appointed under the eligibility criteria for consultant posts that applied at the time.</p>  <p>  I am currently bringing legislation through the Oireachtas, the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2019, that will enable the Medical Council to place those who were properly appointed under the criteria that applied prior to the introduction of the specialist registration requirement in 2008; where it is satisfied that it would be in order to do so. Report Stage is scheduled for tomorrow, 6th November. </p>  <p>  The objective of the overall project is to progress to having all consultants employed by the HSE on the Specialist Division of the Register. In this context, the Report identifies the impact of the ongoing challenges in the recruitment of consultants, including reduced numbers of applicants for consultant posts and the recruitment process itself, as significant factors at present and proposes a number of key recommendations.  The analysis identifies particular problems in certain specialties including Community Mental Health services and certain acute hospital specialties including Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, Anaesthesia/Intensive Care Medicine and Obstetrics/Gynaecology.</p></reply>

The Department, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), with the full support of stakeholders, are implementing a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of health services and continued supply of medicines and medical devices in the event of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. Chapter 24 of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update, published in July 2019, details work which has been undertaken in relation to the supply of medicines and medical devices. .</p><p>Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediately after the UK's exit from the European Union. Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain, which already has additional stocks of medicines routinely built into it.</p><p>There is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions, as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients. Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions and take their medications as they normally would. </p><p>The Department, the HSE and the HPRA have facilitated ongoing engagements with manufacturers and suppliers of medicines and medical devices, to ensure that they are Brexit-ready, to discuss any potential issues that could affect supply to Ireland and to identify solutions to maintain supply to the market. </p><p>Unfortunately, medicine shortages are a feature of modern health systems, but Ireland has a multi-stakeholder system in place to prevent and manage shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit. Any shortages currently affecting the Irish market are not directly attributable to Brexit. </p><p>Significant work has been undertaken to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and risks and to provide a high level of assurance around continuity of care and treatment for patients in Ireland. Work on this will continue, including ongoing monitoring of supplies in Ireland and engagement with industry to adapt supply chains, where necessary, to minimise any potential disruption.</p></reply>

In 2019 almost &euro;30 million extra was added to the budget, with a target of delivering 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people. This represented about 800,000 more hours of support than the 2018 target.</p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.</p>  <p>  To achieve a balanced budget in 2019 the HSE must ensure that the cost of the home support hours being provided does not exceed the available budget. This is in line with normal prudent management of the budget.  It is not correct to say that there is an embargo on home support hours.  The allocation of new hours continues to be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available. </p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, an additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year. </p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. </p>  <p>  We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020. In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.  </p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens. </p>  <p>  The core principles of Healthy Ireland, Positive Ageing, prevention and early intervention will underpin this approach.</p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment, I am advised by the HSE that while there is no national recruitment embargo or moratorium, there is a priority requirement for all HSE services to maintain, or get to, an affordable staffing level that is sustainable in 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services.</p>  <p>  In light of this, the HSE have introduced control measures relating to staffing and recruitment to ensure that they live within the available resources provided to them.  This does mean that in some Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations non-critical replacement posts will be paused, however, the HSE report that there is on-going capacity for replacement of critical clinical posts within frontline services throughout this period.</p></reply>

The Traveller community is among a number of priority groups identified in these strategies, acknowledging that, while Travellers are eligible to avail of all mainstream public health services, they also have specific needs and mental health services should be delivered in a culturally-appropriate way.</p><p>For this reason, in 2017 the HSE committed to the recruitment of nine Mental Health Coordinators for Travellers, eight of whom are currently in post. The focus of these roles is to work within the CHOs to support improved access, consistency and integration of mental health services to meet the mental health needs of Travellers. </p><p>The Department of Health also provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum, through the HSE, for targeted measures to improve the health status of the Travelling community.  These include: </p><p>- primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff; and </p><p>- mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.  </p><p>In addition, the Department of Justice and Equality's National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy also details HSE-specific actions. Of particular note is the commitment by the HSE to develop a National Traveller Health Action Plan. </p><p>The HSE circulated a first draft of the action plan in March 2019 for consultation with stakeholders, including the Department of Health. The draft is currently being revised to take account of feedback and is expected to be finalised in quarter 4 2019.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. The Minister for Health has no role in relation to reimbursement decisions.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro, ongoing investments. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it has received two applications for pricing and reimbursement of Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) in Multiple Sclerosis.</p>  <p>  On 29 August 2018, the NCPE completed a health technology assessment for Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, agreement has been reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication when reimbursed. The HSE intends to progress Ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which was approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis.</p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis. They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication. </p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded, the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group and the HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the statutory criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

GPs can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if a woman has severe menopausal symptoms that have a significant impact on her everyday activities.  Women who have a medical card are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards (including consultant services), all out-patient public hospital services (including consultant services).</p>  <p>  A Women's Health Taskforce has been established by the Department of Health to improve women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. It met for the first time on 26th September 2019 and is being led by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the Director General of the European Institute for Women&rsquo;s Health in partnership with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce will tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland and will work on these on a phased, prioritised basis. The first action will be a &lsquo;radical listening&rsquo; exercise that will invite women in Ireland to share their experiences of and solutions for the health system. This will be a significant, substantial and large-scale consultation process.

The couple involved have requested a review of their case.  </p>  <p>  My overriding concern as Minister for Health is for the couple involved and ensuring that questions regarding this incident are appropriately answered. As such, I support an independent and external review into this case. I have been advised that the National Maternity Hospital has commissioned such a review. I am sure that the Deputy would agree it is important to await the outcome of that review process, which will allow for a better understanding of what has occurred. It will also allow for any learning that may emerge to be disseminated throughout the health system. I can assure the Deputy and the House that any recommendations made by the review panel will be actioned by my Department, as well as the HSE in order to ensure that a similar incident does not occur again. My Department has also sought assurances from the National Maternity Hospital with regard to the safety and operation of the termination service, and it in turn has confirmed its compliance with the relevant legislation. </p>  <p>  I have also met with the family to hear directly of their experiences. I and my officials are in ongoing correspondence with their representative.</p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to the issue the Deputy raises with regard to the medical notes in this case, I understand that an ICT issue has arisen with regard to their availability as a paper copy. However, I have been advised that a technical solution to allow access to them is being pursued by the Hospital and it is hoped that this aspect of the matter will be resolved shortly. In any event, both the Hospital and my Department have offered to provide the family with access to these files via alternative electronic means.</p></reply>

In line with this, 11 community and voluntary representatives are included on the oversight structures of the strategy, which give leadership and direction to support the implementation of the strategy. </p><p>I am the chair of the National Oversight Committee which has a cross-sectoral membership from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors. The Committee meets every three months and held its most recent meeting on 20th September 2019. There is also a standing sub-committee which promotes coordination between national, local and regional levels. </p><p>Drug and alcohol task forces that play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in local communities and in ensuring that a coordinated approach is taken across all sectors to address substance misuse based on the identified needs and priorities in their areas.

This includes supporting community representatives on Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, organising a national community representatives&rsquo; network and participating on the national oversight structures for the national drugs strategy.  </p><p>The Task Forces oversee an annual budget of &euro;28m from the Department of Health and the HSE. This funding supports over 280 community projects, in local areas and communities throughout the country, to support initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol use and misuse.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;1m has been provided in 2019. This included &euro;480,000 to provide an additional &euro;20,000 for each of the 24 Task Forces, &euro;10,000 of which will be on a permanent recurring basis. It also funds 13 strategic initiatives to respond to emerging trends in substance misuse and to improve access to services for people with complex needs. The funding was allocated following a national consultation with the 24 Task Forces and 9 community healthcare organisations. I am confident the new strategic initiatives will have a positive impact and make a difference to people&rsquo;s lives as they journey to recovery.</p><p>I am committed to working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary sectors in implementing the national drugs strategy.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.

In 2019 almost &euro;30 million extra was added to the budget, with a target of delivering 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people. This represented about 800,000 more hours of support than the 2018 target.</p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow. The allocation of funding for home supports across the system, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.</p>  <p>  To achieve a balanced budget in 2019 the HSE must ensure that the cost of the home support hours being provided does not exceed the available budget. This is in line with normal prudent management of the budget.  It is not correct to say that there is an embargo on home support hours.  The allocation of new hours continues to be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available.</p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, an additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year.</p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.</p>  <p>  We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020. In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.  </p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens.</p>  <p>  The core principles of Healthy Ireland, Positive Ageing, prevention and early intervention will underpin this approach.</p>  <p>  In relation to recruitment, I am advised by the HSE that while there is no national recruitment embargo or moratorium, there is a priority requirement for all HSE services to maintain, or get to, an affordable staffing level that is sustainable in 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services.</p>  <p>  In light of this, the HSE have introduced control measures relating to staffing and recruitment to ensure that they live within the available resources provided to them.  This does mean that in some Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations non-critical replacement posts will be paused, however, the HSE report that there is on-going capacity for replacement of critical clinical posts within frontline services throughout this period.</p></reply>

Quality service provision is expensive and it is fair and equitable that all those in receipt of publicly funded residential care make appropriate payment toward the maintenance and accommodation costs associated with providing such services, if they can afford to do so.  Funding derived from maintenance and accommodation contributions will continue to be directly applied by the HSE towards the provision of health services.&rdquo;</i> </blockquote>  <p>Residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions apply to all forms of residential support services, other than acute in-patient services and nursing home services provided to those supported under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal).  In line with the system of charges it replaced, residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions: </p><p>- apply to the maintenance and accommodation elements only of services which are provided by the HSE or by agencies funded to provide services on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.</p><p>- become payable when a person has already received at least 30 days of residential support services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. Accordingly, each episode of rehabilitative care might not necessarily result in a contribution requirement. </p><p>The Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016 (as amended) provide for the rates of income-based contributions which are payable towards accommodation and maintenance costs.In accommodation such as a community hospital where full-time nursing and/or medical care is provided, the current contribution rates payable are subject to a maximum of &euro;25.57 daily (&euro;179 per week) for a person whose income is &euro;223 per week or more.</p><p>Affordability and the avoidance of financial hardship are built-in features of the residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions provisions.  In all cases, the contribution rates are based on sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes. Additionally, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides that the HSE may reduce or waive a contribution where appropriate, in order to: </p><p>- avoid undue financial hardship on the part of the service user and/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants  <i>,</i></p><p>- advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or</p><p>- take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.</p><p>To assist in the fair application of the framework, the HSE has published, and periodically updated, national guidelines for the correct determination of the contributions and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and his or her dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on his or her dependants.  </p><p>The features of the residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions framework ensure that it is reasonable and fair and that each service user's contributions are based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances.  </p><p>The HSE publishes detailed supporting documentation in relation to residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions on its website at  www.hse.ie/longstaycontributions.</p></reply>

Budget 2020 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;75 million in 2019 to &euro;100 million in 2019. The year-on-year increases to the NTPF since Budget 2017 reflect this Government&rsquo;s priority to improve waiting times for patients to access hospital treatment. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and the NTPF to develop the Scheduled Care Access Plan 2020. In this regard, the HSE National Service Plan 2020 will set out a planned activity level for the year ahead, while the NTPF will work with the hospital system to provide additionality to reduce inpatient/day case, with a particular focus on improving access to hospital outpatient services. </p><p>In 2020, NTPF will further expand its list of targeted inpatient and daycase procedures to support further reductions in wait times as well as increasing funding towards supporting full packages of care for patients on the outpatient waiting lists, to include the surgery or treatment where required.  </p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Under the Inpatient Day Case Access Plan 2018, cataracts were one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF, and by end December 2018, the number of patients waiting had fallen to 6,440, a reduction of 36%. The number of patients waiting for a cataract procedure at the end of September 2019 had further reduced to 5,074, with 506 of patients waiting over 9 months. This represents a reduction of 3,865 or 88% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract operation.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the NTPF have provided details of the number of people with addresses in Co. Kerry waiting for an Ophthalmology Outpatient appointment in Cork University Hospital, and the number of people awaiting cataract surgery in South Infirmary Royal Victoria Hospital, at the end of September, in the following table.</p><p>Total Number of people from Co.

I particularly welcome the advance commitment to &euro;60 million in 2021 as it will enable the recruitment of up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other professionals in the community on a phased basis during the course of next year.  This will allow for these funded posts to be in place by the end of next year and throughout 2021 in order to address the needs identified in the Health Service Capacity Review recommendations.

The Minister for Health has no role in relation to reimbursement decisions.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, the company must submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>  Epidyolex received a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU on 19th September 2019 (Agency Product Number EMEA/H/C/004675). It is a medicine used in addition to clobazam to treat patients from the age of two years who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome.</p><p>I am advised by the HSE that it has not received a formal application for pricing and reimbursement to date for the drug Epidyolex (Epidiolex in USA).  If an application for reimbursement is received, it will be processed in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for this, such as a patient undertaking the application process for NHSS, awaiting assessment for a home support package, homelessness, ward of court application, and the availability of resources.</p>  <p>  When possible, the HSE will use transitional care to accommodate the patient during the period between discharge and the finalisation of new care arrangements, but there can often be a delay, especially in cases where the patient and family are coming to terms with the new circumstances.</p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply, and we have seen an increase the number of delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support. In response, and in the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to the current the high-level of DTOCs. However, recognising the urgency of the situation, approval was provided to the HSE to begin actions immediately to the value of &euro;5m in 2019.  As part of these measures the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals within NHSS in September, and provided additional home care and transitional care beds.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's specific question, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with the requested information.</p></reply>

This legislation was transposed into national legislation via S.I. 62 of 2016 (as amended).</p>  <p>  The identification of an equine is the first step in ensuring the safety of the food chain.  This process requires the engagement of a veterinary practitioner to mark the equine and to check for the presence of a transponder which, where present, provides an important link between the animal and its original identification document.</p>  <p>  The administration of certain medications is recorded on the equine passport and the loss of this information represents a break in the identity and chain of information on the animal. The loss of an original document and its subsequent replacement with a duplicate passport or a replacement passport results in potentially more than one lifetime identification document in circulation in respect of the animal. </p>  <p>  Duplicate documents are issued in accordance with Article 29 of CR 262/2015. Paragraph 2(c) of that Article provides that duplicate passports must be classified as 'not intended for slaughter for human consumption'. Similarly, Article 32(2)(c) of CR 262/2015 sets out similar requirements for replacement equine passports. </p>  <p>  The level of fees charged for the issue of duplicate passports is a commercial matter for Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs). </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is imperative that all equine animals slaughtered for human consumption are properly identified in accordance with legislation to ensure the integrity of the food chain and the protection of human health.</p></reply>

BEEP targets the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves through the collection of live weights of cows and progeny in the herd of each participant.</p>  <p>  Participants cannot guess the weight of animals under the Pilot - animals must be weighed on the participant's holding on a set of scales registered with ICBF as part of the Pilot.  Animals must be weighed individually and on the same day and the data submitted to ICBF within 7 days. All weights must be submitted before the 15th November 2019.</p>  <p>  There are two options available to herd-owners for the recording of weight data as part of BEEP. These are: (i) a Rental model, whereby participants rent scales from an approved field service agent to undertake the BEEP weight recording process, or (ii) Owned, borrowed or using a third party service providers&rsquo; scales. This is where a farmer can use their own scales or one belonging to a third party. These scales will have to be pre-registered with ICBF as per the Terms and Conditions of the Pilot. </p>  <p>  Inspections in relation to BEEP are being undertaken. This is to ensure that data submitted under the pilot is accurate. These controls can include the verification of privately owned scales, the breed of the animals involved in the pilot and the accuracy of weights submitted.</p>  <p>  Payments have commenced to BEEP participants who have completed the weighing and submission of data in respect of all of their eligible animals. Further payments will be made in the coming weeks as more participants complete the required actions under the Pilot. Final payments are scheduled for early December 2019.  </p></reply>

I am keenly aware that the past year has been very challenging for beef farmers.</p>  <p>  The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM), which recently closed for applications, will provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty.  Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of almost &euro;78 million.     </p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. </p>  <p>  This year, I introduced the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million scheme which will provide suckler farmers with valuable data on the weaning efficiency of their animals. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for beef farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, Knowledge Transfer Groups and the ANC scheme. </p>  <p>  The total budget for the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme was increased again this year to &euro;250 million. Further to changes in EU Regulations, payments under the ANC scheme will now be delivered in two instalments, with 85% advance payments issuing from mid-September and a 15% balancing payment issuing from early December.    </p>  <p>  Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  In recognising the major challenges faced by the farming sector and the important role that various schemes operated by my Department play in underpinning the viability of many farms, I secured agreement from the European Commission that will allow for a higher rate of advance payments under the 2019 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and a number of Rural Development Schemes. </p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development. Food Wise 2025 prioritises the potential for growth in new and emerging markets. </p>  <p>  My Department has also proactively engaged with several potential  beef Producer Organisations, which have the possibility to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent months. </p></reply>

This sampling is one element of a comprehensive multi-layered control programme which is systematically applied in Ireland. </p><p>The same control system enabled my Department, in 2017, to confirm a case of Atypical BSE in an 18-year-old cow, also through its surveillance of fallen animals at knackeries.  There were no associated public health risks with this event. The disclosure of this case of Atypical BSE has no impact on Ireland&rsquo;s current OIE BSE &quot;controlled risk&quot; status or trade status.</p><p>Human health continues to be protected by the ante-mortem inspection of animals by veterinarians before being allowed into the food chain, and the removal and destruction of tissues shown to be capable of transmitting infection.  A diminishing number of such cases have been identified in Ireland and in other countries over the years.  Animal health continues to be protected by the ban on the feeding of ruminant meat and bone meal to all farmed animal species. Associated controls are in place to ensure implementation, as well as a range of further control measures.  Accessing emerging beef markets in Asia requires robust assurances on BSE and this surveillance provides these assurances.  </p><p>The cost for BSE testing on fallen animals in knackeries from 2014 to 2018 is shown in the table below.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Cost of BSE Testing</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>         Cost of BSE Testing       </b></td>       <td><b>       </b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>&euro;518,080.90 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;577,121.43 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;655,853.22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;648,901.26 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;807,998.26 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;3,207,955.07   </b></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This is as a result of significant State investment. We now have a new challenge, to meet 8,000 hectares of new planting each year as set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am very aware that this is in the face of declining planting rates and that this year has been disappointing in terms of hectares planted.</p>  <p>  However, I believe that we can, through a concerted and collaborative effort from government, the private sector, public bodies and local communities, reverse this trend and meet the Climate Action targets so essential to delivering on our national climate change objectives. </p>  <p>  Support for afforestation from Government is delivered through the generous grants and premiums available, across 12 different planting categories which offer real options to suit every landowner.  Farmers can continue with livestock farming, while supplementing their income by planting trees, and we intend communicating this message widely. To this end, we are funding 15 promotion projects countrywide this year and next in the amount of &euro;830,000 and Teagasc is actively promoting forestry through a substantial programme of educational and forestry events.</p>  <p>  Communities can and have become involved through the NeighbourWood Scheme, funded by my Department, which supports the development of accessible woodlands for public use and enjoyment.</p>  <p>  The Woodland Environmental Fund allows business to discharge their corporate responsibility and to support the national effort by paying a supplementary &euro;1,000 a hectare to landowners for the planting of native woodlands.  I am delighted that An Post  is supporting this initiative through the  establishment of a new native woodland in County Galway, and  I know that other organisations have expressed interest in encouraging native woodland planting by means of the Fund.</p>  <p>  Public bodies have a role to play too.  In this regard, I very much welcome the recent announcement by Coillte and Bord na Mona of their plans to plant 4 million native trees on 1,500 hectares over the next three years.  I will be encouraging others to follow suit.</p>  <p>  In terms of the afforestation scheme, I acknowledge that changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) has resulted in delays to many files.  These  are beyond my Department&rsquo;s control as we are obliged to implement changes to AAP that were required following important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee and others.  All forestry licences issued by the Department undergo a legal consent process. Since 2017, all licence afforestation and forest road applications received have been subject to a statutory public notification system and all afforestation, forest roads and felling decisions  issued are subject to a statutory appeal system operated by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC). </p>  <p>  Most appeals have been in connection with our Appropriate Assessment (AA) procedure. The Habitat Directive (Article 6.3) requires that where a plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on a Natura site, either individually or in-combination with other plans or projects, it must undergo an appropriate assessment of its implications for that Natura site. In this regard, the introduction of the 15 km assessment buffer around potential forestry sites is necessary and is an industry norm.</p>  <p>  Currently, we are amending the AA procedure in order to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involves the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  Last week, the Department advertised for additional ecologists and we also have access to external ecological support, which will be supplemented in due course.  Inspectors have already undergone training and will receive appropriate support in delivering these new procedures; they are not on a work to rule. A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that this has led to a temporary disruption in issuing afforestation licences, we know that the sector has approximately 3,200 hectares of approvals issued this year which are shovel-ready and yet to be planted.  </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the concerns of the sector in relation to the AA process. My officials are in regular communication with stakeholders and they have been fully apprised of the issues involved and of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to address them.  They have also been advised of steps they can take to ensure that applications received are completed to an acceptable standard and to take account of any issues relating to sensitive habitats.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, for my part, I have commissioned a consultant to review my Department's processes and procedures on forestry applications and approvals similar to an exercise undertaken in Scotland.  I expect to receive this report by the end of November and that it will provide an opportunity to make our processes more effective and efficient going forward. </p></reply>

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes. </p>  <p>  The method of selecting cases for inspection is set down in EU regulations and is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process with cases being selected on a risk and random basis.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be in respect of eligible beneficiaries under the various schemes. Therefore, the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15th May, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is fulfilled.. </p>  <p>  This year, late applications were accepted up to 9th June, with a deduction. Furthermore, amendments to applications were accepted up to 9th June, and, allowing for the Preliminary Checks process whereby applicants could amend their application further up to 19th June as a result of issues notified to them by my Department, the final details of the land to be subject to the inspection process cannot be fully established until these periods have elapsed.    </p>  <p>  The process of a Remote Sensing inspection involves a comprehensive review of the satellite imagery received at two stages during the year, and also the assessment of additional imagery, where required, to ensure that the actual claimed area in the application corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the crop types are as claimed and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes. The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground. </p>  <p>  Some 6,840 applicants have been selected for a Remote Sensing inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 4th November, my Department had received inspection results in respect of 83% of these cases for final processing. Of these cases, over 95% have been finalised and advanced to payment stage processing, which ensures that any non-inspection related scheme criteria have been met. For example, an applicant under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme must meet scheme specific criteria relating to stocking density and stock retention periods before payment can issue.</p>  <p>  Where an over-declaration in area, at scheme level, is identified as part of the inspection process, officials in my Department contact the applicant concerned giving them the opportunity to accept the inspection findings or to submit comments for examination. Currently, 2% of cases for which inspection results have been received are at this stage of the process and will be finalised when the applicant contacts my Department. The remaining cases are subject to final processing. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to finalise the outcome of Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that ANC and BPS payments due are issued as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

A number of measures to rebalance the rental sector in favour of long-term leasing have been introduced in recent years. Long-term leasing has a number of advantages over the short-term conacre system: it allows progressive farmers to enlarge their farm holdings and increase productivity; it provides young farmers and new entrants cheaper access to land as opposed to the relatively high cost of ownership; it provides security of tenure and the certainty required to encourage lessees to maintain and make an investment in improving land and is especially important in accessing bank credit. It also provides a route to retirement for older farmers, assisting in generation renewal.</p></reply>

BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The implementing regulation was within the competence of the European Commission and Member States were invited to comment on the contents of the draft regulation.  However, it was not open for negotiation.  Ireland subsequently published a formal notification of the scheme as required under the regulation. </p>  <p>  The scheme was designed to target aid to those who had been most impacted by the market disturbance for which it was requested. The reduction/restructuring requirement was required by the Commission; it was also required to be at individual farm level. </p>  <p>  As the scheme is voluntary, it is a decision for individual eligible farmers as to whether to participate or not.  In response to requests from farm bodies, the period for receipt of applications was extended to 20 September and there was support and advice available to prospective applicants from my Department at the National Ploughing Championships.   </p>  <p>  In total 34,517 applications were received, representing a potential payment of &euro;78,192,380. A further 560 applicants, who did not qualify for the support as they had failed to meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the scheme Terms and Conditions, submitted an application under appeal in order to have their eligibility for the scheme reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Under the implementing regulation, Ireland may grant additional national support for the measures taken under Article 1 of the regulation up to a maximum of 100% of EU funding. Therefore, undrawn funds cannot be used for other purposes outside of the measure.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports.  I intend to consult with stakeholders as to the use of these funds.  </p></reply>

In Budget 2020, the Government allocated &euro;52.8 million for the Warmer Homes Scheme to support the retrofitting of the homes of people living in or at risk of energy poverty. This represents the biggest ever allocation for the Scheme &ndash; more than double the initial allocation for 2019. &euro;13 million of this funding is ring-fenced revenue arising from the increase in the carbon price.  Income eligibility for the Warmer Homes Scheme requires applicants to be in receipt of one of the following Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments: - - </p><p>-  Fuel Allowance </p><p>-  Job Seekers Allowance for over 6 months and have a child under seven years of age </p><p>-  Working Family Payment </p><p>-  One-Parent Family Payment </p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance </p><p>-  Carers Allowance and live with the person you are caring for</p><p>The measures that can be carried out under the Warmer Homes Scheme include the following: </p><p>-  Attic Insulation </p><p>-  Cavity Wall Insulation</p><p>-  External Wall Insulation</p><p>-  Internal Wall Insulation</p><p>-  Ventilation</p><p>-  Lagging Jackets, Draught Proofing and Energy Efficient Lighting </p><p>-  Heating Systems and Windows (only when recommended by SEAI surveyor)</p><p>The exact mix of measures provided to each property depends on the existing condition of the home and the recommendations of an SEAI survey of the home. </p><p>Additional funding is also being made available to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to retrofit local authority homes. This includes &euro;20 million of carbon price revenue which has been allocated to deliver grouped upgrades as promised in the Climate Action Plan. Targeted at the Midlands, the new scheme will be built around core work on some of the social housing stock in the region but also designed to allow other homeowners to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; to the aggregation model which will streamline services on an area basis. The specific design of the scheme will be led by the Retrofit Taskforce which is chaired by my Department.</p></reply>

This followed a tender process designed to ensure that every home and business throughout the country will have access to future proofed high speed broadband and will cater specifically to an estimated 1.1 million people, representing almost 25% of the population of rural Ireland who would not otherwise have access to this vital service. Since then my officials have been performing the due diligence work needed before a contract can be concluded. </p>  <p>  As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s Guidelines on the application of the State aid rules on broadband. The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process in particular to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required.</p>  <p>My Department recently conducted a public consultation to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks, or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. That consultation was extended twice at the request of operators, resulting in a total nine week period for submissions and it closed on 30th September 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p>  <p>  Operator submissions are assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria.

Government has committed to delivering a whole of Government approach, and to working with local stakeholders, to ensuring that a just transition is provided to those impacted by this transition.   Budget 2020 includes a number of measures that will form part of the Governments approach to supporting a Just Transition. They include: </p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund; </p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for bog restoration and rehabilitation; and </p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million to deliver new model to group housing upgrades. </p>  <p>  These measures will be immediately targeted at the Midlands and will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further engagement with local stakeholders on the application of the funding. </p>  <p>  I understand that, following extensive engagement between ESB, the staff at Moneypoint and their trade unions, staff have accepted a proposal relating to the reconfiguration of the station based on a new lower running regime. This proposal was accepted in a staff ballot which concluded on 4 October. This is a positive step in retaining an on-going operation in Moneypoint. ESB will continue to work with staff and their representatives to implement the agreement in a collaborative way to face the challenges ahead. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that ESB remains committed to Moneypoint and, in line with its Brighter Future strategy and Government decarbonisation policy, the Company is currently examining technology options for the plant that will deliver large-scale, low-carbon electricity generation, fuel diversity, and security of supply, after generation from coal ceases no later than 2025.</p>  <p>  The agencies of the State will support workers affected through their services and I am open to receiving submissions from regional stakeholders on remaining challenges which might need support in the context of just transition.</p></reply>

It was designated as a project of common interest in 2013 and again in 2015, and 2017. It has been supported by Ireland since 2013 as it would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s energy security by increasing import route diversity. This project is one of a number of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects included in the 4th EU PCI list. </p>  <p>  However, while Ireland continued to support the inclusion of Shannon LNG on the 4th EU PCI list, I have made it clear that the Government will not consider any application for EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) funding for any LNG project until an energy and sustainability security of supply review has been completed and considered by the Government and the D&aacute;il, and only if the projects in question are consistent with national and EU climate policy objectives. </p>  <p>  The energy sustainability and security review will consider how and from where fossil fuels are sourced during a transition to a carbon neutral economy. It will also consider the role that battery storage, pumped storage, hydrogen and CCS can play. </p>  <p>  In addition, at the meeting of 4 October 2019 which considered the 4th PCI list, Ireland enquired from the EU Commission whether the implications of importing LNG to the European Union, from conventional and unconventional fracked sources, have been examined in terms of a sustainable, secure and competitive European energy policy. The Commission advised that it had launched a study on methane emissions and agreed with the need to link gas imports to the objective of a climate neutral economy. </p>  <p>  In relation to the process of PCI selection, it is organised by the European Commission in accordance with the requirements of EU Regulation 347/2013 which covers PCIs. This involves an evaluation process of projects put forward by project promoters. The process also involves the project promoters, regulators, Member States and other stakeholders participating in regional groups to discuss the projects. </p>  <p>  The draft PCI list, which was agreed by Member States and the Commission at a meeting of 4 October 2019, has now been adopted by delegated act by the European Commission, and forwarded by the Commission to the European Council and Parliament for their consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department did not seek external advice on the inclusion of the Shannon LNG project on the 4th   list of Projects of Common Interest; the project has been included on each of the previous PCI lists from 2013 to date. The project is a private commercial project and the future development of this project, including final investment decisions, are matters for the project promoter. </p>  <p>  The EU Regulation which provides for the designation of a project of common interest does not override the requirement to comply with environmental law or to obtain the necessary permits or consents. Compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits, including environmental assessment, are the responsibility of the project promoter. Decisions on consents for the construction of an LNG plant would be a matter for the relevant consenting authorities. </p></reply>

The Government has allocated &euro;20 million of Carbon Price revenue to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to deliver grouped upgrades as promised in the Climate Action Plan. Targeted at the Midlands, the scheme will be built around core work on some of the social housing stock in the region but will also be designed to allow other homeowners to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; to the aggregation model which will streamline services on an area basis. It will also support an estimated 400 jobs directly and indirectly. The specific design of the project will be led by the Retrofit Taskforce which was established in recent weeks and is chaired by my Department. Decisions in relation to the locations that will be involved in the scheme next year have not yet been made. </p>  <p>  This significantly increased level of investment represents an important step towards realising the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan targets in the area of building retrofitting while prioritising the most vulnerable households.</p></reply>

The report indicates that air quality levels at monitoring sites in Ireland were below the current EU legislative limit values in 2018, although the stricter World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline values (which are lower and, therefore, offer greater protection) were exceeded at a number of monitoring sites for fine particulate matter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).    Particulate matter from the domestic burning of solid fuel is one of the main pollutants identified in the report. In relation to the proposed nationwide extension of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal (or &ldquo;the smoky coal ban&rdquo;, as it is commonly known), I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question [41406/19] of 16 October, and note that the position is unchanged. </p>  <p>  In relation to the comments of the Asthma Society, my officials recently had a positive meeting with representatives of the Society to hear their views on the issue, and I look forward to further engagement in the future.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I intend to publish the National Clean Air Strategy in the coming months, to inter alia set out a number of policy measures to improve air quality nationwide. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s roll-out of the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which will greatly improve the data available on air pollution in Ireland, facilitating the design and targeting of appropriate policy measures to tackle it. </p></reply>

The National Ambulance Service (NAS) integrated Eircodes into its computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system in February 2016. NAS use a state-of-the-art CAD system that utilises only the latest version of Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) digital maps for call taking and ambulance dispatch and not Google maps. Callers to the NAS give the patients address and Eircode. The advanced mobile locator automatically positions the patient&rsquo;s property and the nearest available ambulance on the NAS call takers OSI digital map. The patient&rsquo;s geographical location along with the Eircode is then sent to the mobile data terminal (MDT) in the ambulance, which allows the ambulance crew navigate to the scene using OSI digital maps so as to arrive at the correct location facilitating speedier access to care. </p>  <p>  Ambulance emergency requests often come from isolated locations. The use of Eircodes assists in the rapid identification of often non-unique, rural addresses.

These actions include developing the infrastructure to stay sufficiently ahead of demand. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 96 fast chargers, which are mainly on national routes, in Ireland. Most of this infrastructure was installed up to 2016 by the ESB as part of its eCars programme with a limited number of charge points installed since. My Department does not have a detailed breakdown by county and year of the charge point installations. However, the public charge points currently provided by ESB eCars are shown along with the status of each charger on their online map. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there is currently no fast charger in County Cavan. I also understand that there is a need for greater numbers of charge points, and in particular fast chargers, as the number of electric vehicles increase. Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million will support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with ESB eCars also investing &euro;10 million. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. </p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  I expect approximately half of the 140 new fast chargers to be installed by the end of 2020 bringing the total to over 160 fast chargers. This is expected to further increase to over 200 by the end of 2021 and over 230 by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2020 provided &euro;2 million in funding for a new SEAI support scheme for public charge points. This scheme provides funding to Local Authorities who install public charge points. A grant of up to &euro;5,000 per charge point is provided with sufficient funding available to support the installation of up to 400 charge points next year. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. </p>  <p>  The initial Warmer Homes Scheme budget allocation for 2019 was &euro;24 million. However, following a mid-year capital review conducted by my Department and SEAI, the budget has been increased to &euro;39.8 million for 2019. The budget for 2020 will be &euro;52.8 million - a record level of funding for the scheme.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding. The rules of the Scheme stipulate that repeat upgrade visits are not provided. This rule is in place to ensure that the available Exchequer funding provides upgrades to as many eligible homes as possible and to prioritise eligible homes that have never had any work completed under the scheme. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the measures available under the scheme were expanded. Previously, those homes which were not suitable for cavity wall insulation could not get their walls insulated under the scheme. Since the expansion of measures, the scheme can now, in certain circumstances, provide internal or external wall insulation. This is permitting the upgrade of a wider range of property types (such as homes with solid walls) and also increases the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve. In addition, it will enable future fuel switching. </p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these types of works and the available budget. The homeowners on this waiting list have never received any form of free upgrade from SEAI under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. This review is underway and will consider the issue of revisits for additional works.</p></reply>

The Scheme has been in existence since 2002 and has provided upgrades to over 140,000 homes, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. </p>  <p>  The scheme is available nationwide and has evolved over time from initially only providing basic insulation, to now also offering a much deeper retrofit including internal and external wall insulation. The Climate Action Plan commits to a review of the scheme being completed by the end of the year to ensure that those most in need are targeted.</p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;52.8 million has been allocated to the Scheme for next year. This represents the biggest ever budget for the Warmer Homes Scheme &ndash; more than double the initial allocation for 2019. &euro;13 million of this funding is ring-fenced revenue arising from the increase in the Carbon Price. This significantly increased level of investment represents an important step towards realising the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan targets in the area of building retrofitting while prioritising the most vulnerable householders. </p>  <p>  Social housing upgrades are a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. A budget of &euro;25 million has been allocated for the social housing energy efficiency retrofit programme in 2019. Budget 2020 has provided an additional &euro;20 million from revenues arising from the increase in the carbon price, for the retrofitting of social housing in the Midlands. This scheme will focus on upgrading much larger batches of homes in distinct, compact geographical areas and allow private homeowners to opt-in. This will determine the savings that can be achieved through a larger scale and more structured approach to the renovation of our housing stock. It will also create new, sustainable employment in the region. The specific design of the project will be driven by the Retrofit Taskforce which is chaired by my Department. </p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas. </p><p>The premises referred to by the Deputy are in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at <i><i>www.broadband.gov.ie.</i></i>The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>Since the Government decision in May 2019 to appoint NBI as the Preferred Bidder for the National Broadband Plan contract, work has continued on the due diligence necessary to conclude the contract. This process is progressing towards contract award, which is expected before the end of the year. The network deployment will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p><p>In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.</p><p>The premises referred to by the Deputy are in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at . The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>Since the Government decision in May 2019 to appoint NBI as the Preferred Bidder for the National Broadband Plan contract, work has continued on the due diligence necessary to conclude the contract. This process is progressing towards contract award, which is expected before the end of the year. The network deployment will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. </p><p>In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p></reply>

I understand, however, that the aim of Project Stratum is to improve broadband connectivity by extending Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband infrastructure to premises across Northern Ireland that cannot yet access such a service. I further understand that while a budget has been identified and a public process of engagement with industry is underway, that the detailed strategy and technical requirements have not yet been published.  </p>  <p>  Based on learning from Ireland&rsquo;s NBP process, where the technology approach and project cost were developed through a very detailed engagement with industry in a competitive public procurement process, it would be premature to draw any comparison between the NBP and Project Stratum at this time. </p>  <p>  Building rural broadband networks is complex and expensive, as we can see from other jurisdictions. For example, Scotland has recently awarded preferred bidder status to BT for Scottish Borders which comprises approximately 26,090 premises, with an estimated subsidy value of &pound;133m which is around &pound;5,000 per premises ex VAT.</p></reply>

ComReg published a number of decisions in November 2018 governing the regulation of wholesale broadband access markets (ComReg docs 18/94, 18/95 and 18/96 &ndash; available on ComReg&rsquo;s website). I understand that ComReg, has concluded that certain obligations be imposed on Eir in certain wholesale broadband access markets, with the intention of promoting effective competition by, inter alia, making it easier for other telecoms operators to use Eir&rsquo;s wholesales services. The obligations include the requirement that Eir publish information in advance regarding its products, services and facilities.</p>  <p>  Separately, in relation to the NBP, my Department recently conducted a public consultation to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks, or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. That consultation was extended twice at the request of operators, resulting in a total nine week period for submissions and it closed on 30th September 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p>  <p>  Operator submissions are assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria.

I subsequently welcomed their decision to pause active promotion of greyhound racing and to keep the situation under review, pending implementation of several reforms.</p>  <p>  Since then, my colleague Brendan Griffin T.D., Minister of State for Tourism and Sport at my Department, has received an update on Bord na gCon's additional and enhanced care and welfare measures, which he forwarded on within the last fortnight to both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. Minister Griffin has made it clear that he has strong personal views on the industry, which do not coincide with my own. I have no problem with him letting those personal views be known to third parties.</p></reply>

It was never the intention of the Disabled Parking scheme that permits and designated bays be restricted to wheelchair users. The choice of the wheelchair symbol, however, is based on the fact that it is internationally recognisable and not tied to a particular language or culture, a universality that allows the holder of a permit to use it all over the world. The Irish permit is designed to a common European standard and any change to the Irish legislation on the matter would require a change at European level first.</p></reply>

In 2010 the Department conducted a review of the Disabled Parking Scheme, in consultation with various stakeholders and one of the issues examined was eligibility for the scheme.  As a result of the review the scheme was revised so that permits are now given on the basis of mobility impairment rather than the diagnosis of a particular condition or illness.  This is in line with the original intention of the scheme.</p>  <p>  People whose invisible disability directly affects their ability to walk may in fact qualify for the permit. The possibility of extending the eligibility criteria for the scheme to include people with invisible disabilities which do not necessarily impair mobility, meanwhile, has been raised on a number of occasions and the Department has consulted extensively with the joint issuing authorities of the scheme, the Disabled Drivers Association of Ireland (DDAI) and the Irish Wheelchair Association (IWC), on this matter.   In light of this consultation there are currently no plans to change the criteria.  </p>  <p>  I would particularly emphasise to the Deputy that issuing a large number of extra permits by extending the eligibility criteria would in fact put the existing scheme under significant additional pressure and compromise the availability of disabled parking spaces in general.</p></reply>

The IMMAC is the funding programme under which an extensive range of infrastructure improvements are carried out which will deliver improved journey speeds and increased reliability for passengers across the country. I have no doubt the Deputy welcomes the fact that I will shortly be seeking Government&rsquo;s approval to enter into a new 5 year IMMAC which will provide over &euro;1billion to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and allow it maintain, renew and improve rail infrastructure. This level of funding represents an approximate 40% increase in the amount of taxpayer funding as compared to the five years between 2014 and 2018 and the fact the network is now funded at a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; level is hugely significant.</p><p>However, <i>Project Ireland 2040 </i>provides additional funding for the rail network above and beyond this significant contribution under the IMMAC. </p><p>In the summer Government approved a new National Train Control Centre which will completely modernise and improve the management of the network and services across the country. Construction will start next year and its completion will support the expanded services planned under the DART Expansion Programme which will roughly double the capacity of the network in the Greater Dublin Area, an area which handles approximately 70% of passenger journeys in any given year. Other projects underway include the City-Centre Re-signalling project, while construction will start next year on a new station in Pelletstown. </p><p>The Deputy will also acknowledge that funding under the PSO programme increased by approximately 6% between 2016 and 2018 which has supported increased services such as the 10-minute DART or greater utilisation of the Phoenix Park tunnel on the Kildare Line in recent years. In order to support further passenger growth Government has very recently approved the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars and I expect those to start entering service in late 2021.</p><p>Separately to the above, the future potential for rail is also being examined at a metropolitan level through the development by the National Transport Authority of metropolitan area transport strategies for all cities, which will assist with the Department&rsquo;s approach toward the mid-term review of the current Project Ireland 2040 funding profiles envisaged in 2022, while an independent review of a potential extension of the Western Rail Corridor is expected to be submitted to the Department shortly. My Department also plans to conduct an evaluation in 2020 of higher speeds on the network in line with the commitment given in <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy can see, there is a significant investment programme underway in relation to rail and I expect this to continue in the years ahead. </p></reply>

I have no function in setting the level of airport charge.</p>  <p>  This independent regulation is intended to serve as a proxy for competition and to require the regulated entity (daa) to do things both in terms of pricing and quality of service provision at Dublin Airport that it would almost certainly not choose to do given a free hand. The overriding strategic objective is to ensure that current and future airport customers are presented with choice, value and quality services which also meet the highest international safety and security standards.</p>  <p>  In the Final Determination on the maximum level of airport charges at Dublin Airport,for the period 2020 to 2024 recently announced by CAR, the average price for the period 2020 &ndash; 2024 will be &euro;7.87.  This represents an 11% reduction in the base-level 2019 price cap of &euro;8.81 and was made following an extended period of stakeholder consultation.  The reasons underpinning this Final Determination have been set out in some detail by CAR in the published document. </p>  <p>  I understand that CAR has acknowledged the need for Dublin Airport to grow and that capital investment is required in both existing and new capacity generating infrastructure which are key pieces of national infrastructure. The price set by CAR makes provision for all capital projects proposed by the daa &ndash; up to &euro;2.3bn of capital investment in the period. The implementation of this investment programme will result in an airport capable of serving 40m passengers per year. </p>  <p>  With regard to the airports outside Dublin there are always competitive challenges to be faced not least because of the overlap in catchment areas with Dublin Airport and/or each other.  Indeed it is for this reason that only Dublin Airport is considered to have market power that necessitates regulatory intervention to protect the interests of consumers. There is clearly a market to be served by the regional airports generally and I am confident that they will continue to successfully exploit the opportunities and grow services.  With the exception of Waterford Airport which has not had scheduled services for some years, both the State-owned and other regional airports have all increased passenger traffic over recent years.      </p></reply>

Bus lanes were created - at some expense to the public - to provide on-street priority for bus-based public transport.  Their goal is to make bus transport faster and more reliable, thereby encouraging more people to switch from private cars to public transport. This will achieve the twin goals of reducing congestion and reducing pollution.</p>  <p>  In addition to buses, bus lanes may also be used by cyclists who, as vulnerable road users, are safer in bus lanes than in general traffic.  The lanes may also, of course, be used by the emergency services. </p>  <p>  After the lanes were originally introduced it was decided to allow taxis to use them.  This was a concession based on the fact that taxis are a form of public transport available for on-street hire, like buses, unlike private hire limousines. </p>  <p>  Since bus lanes were first introduced, there have been many requests to allow other classes of traffic to use the lanes.  These have included requests on behalf of motorcyclists, multi-occupancy vehicles, electric vehicles, hired limousines, hackneys, and animal ambulances, among others. My predecessors and I have always rejected these requests. Any addition to the categories of vehicle permitted to use the lanes would inevitably reduce their efficiency in performing the original purpose of prioritising bus-based public transport.  This would reduce the quality and level of service for the ordinary commuter travelling by bus.  In addition, it would not enhance the safety of the cyclists using bus lanes.</p></reply>

People resident in Ireland will no longer be able to drive on a UK (including NI) driving licence. </p>  <p>  If there is an agreed Brexit, the current Withdrawal Agreement provides for arrangements to recognise UK driving licences across the EU during the transition period which is until December 2020.</p>  <p>  In the Road Traffic Acts, legislation exists to allow for the recognition of foreign driving licences for exchange purposes.  In a no deal Brexit, when the UK becomes a third country, arrangements can be made under those Acts.

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  The Government has no plans  to introduce alternative tolling arrangements on the M50 at the present time.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the M50 Demand Management Study in April 2014, TII implemented a range of measures designed to improve the operational efficiency of the route, particularly at peak times.  These include modifications to the merge and diverge layouts at junctions, increased incident access points and increased provision of incident response units.  Measures to improve incident management co-operation with the emergency services, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin Fire Brigade, have also been developed and are monitored to ensure that optimum procedures are in place to minimise delays caused by traffic incidents.</p>  <p>  In addition, the introduction of the Variable Speed Limit system on the M50 will improve its operational efficiency by smoothing traffic flow, improving journey time reliability and reducing the number of traffic collisions.  This will be achieved through the setting of mandatory reduced speed limits, appropriate to the prevailing traffic conditions, using electronic speed limit signs displayed overhead each lane.  Also, Lane Control Signalling will be installed, allowing the temporary closure of lanes which will be signalled by a red 'X' over the closed lane on the overhead illuminated gantry signage, to protect road users and emergency services during an incident on the route. </p>  <p>  I hope that this information is of assistance to you. </p></reply>

The Convention aims to ensure decent conditions of work in fishing with regard to minimum requirements for work on board; conditions of service; accommodation and food; occupational safety and health protection; and medical care and social security. </p><p>In May 2012, the EU social partners in the sea fisheries sector reached an agreement concerning the ILO Work in Fishing Convention.  The agreement aimed to, promote the ratification of the ILO Work in Fishing Convention; create a level playing field within the EU fishing sector; improve the living and working conditions fishers on board sea going fishing vessels. On 31<sup>st</sup>January 2017, Council Directive 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners' agreement on the ILO Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ No. L 25, 31.1.2017, p.12).</p><p>The Directive comprises seven articles and an Annex which sets out the Agreement concerning the implementation of the Convention. My Department supports the Directive which aims to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU member state.  In  particular, the  Directive  seeks  to  improve health  and safety for fisher&rsquo;s within the EU and establishes a  consolidated  legal  framework  suited  to  working  conditions  in  the commercial fishing sector.</p><p>Work on the transposition of Council Directive (EU) 2017/159 is at an advanced stage. At present, my officials are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of a package of Regulations in order to ensure the transposition of the Directive.

The aggregate estimates for 2011 to 2018 are as follows:</p><p>Year(000's)</p><p>20116,230 </p><p>20126,033 </p><p>20136,455 </p><p>20146,729 </p><p>20156,853 </p><p>20167,006 </p><p>20176,777 </p><p>20186,836</p><p>(2019 year to date estimates are not available).  </p><p>The initial impact of the Brexit referendum for tourism saw a reduction of 5% in the number of tourists coming from Britain in 2017 (compared to 2016) on foot of the depreciation in Sterling. The GB market was steady in 2018, with the number of visits up marginally up compared to 2017. To date in 2019, the number of GB visitors remains steady, but is still down when compared to 2016.</p><p>Brexit has been a major factor in my Department&rsquo;s planning for some time now, particularly given the importance of Britain as a key source market for tourism.</p><p>In 2019 the Government allocated almost &euro;8 million in additional funding to the tourism agencies specifically to respond to the impact of Brexit. In addition, I was pleased to secure a &euro;7 million supplementary budget for the tourism agencies for the remainder of 2019 to mitigate the on-going effects of Brexit uncertainty.  </p><p>This additional funding has enabled Tourism Ireland to put in place a programme of marketing activity, post-Brexit research, and stakeholder information to ensure that potential visitors in relevant markets fully appreciate that it is &quot;business as usual&quot; for Ireland and the Irish tourism industry. Tourism Ireland also concluded a wide-ranging review of the British market in early 2019 and implemented its new market strategy for growth in the GB market in June.  </p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is supporting tourism enterprises to respond to the impact of Brexit.  The &lsquo;Get Brexit Ready&rsquo; programme is helping businesses to assess the risk and respond to changes and will also assist the sector in diversifying into other markets. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work is focusing primarily on border counties and the South East region which have been most adversely affected by the drop in the value of sterling. It is also taking action to promote domestic holidays to visitors from Northern Ireland.</p><p>Tourism is a sector that has already been impacted by Brexit and in that regard my Department and the tourism agencies continue to monitor the situation closely, working with our industry colleagues here and our trade partners and carriers in the markets.</p></reply>

The award of public service obligation (PSO) funding falls under the independent statutory remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The allocations to the companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and, in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.

In Pobal&rsquo;s latest Early Years Sector Profile Report (2017/2018), the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7% which, despite a 3% improvement on the previous year, was unsustainably high. However, data from previous years suggests that only half of those contained in the 24.7% figure have left the sector, with the other half joining other services. </p><p>Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare is now &euro;12.55 (as of May 2019), which represents a 3% increase on last year. </p><p>As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p><p>My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5 </i>the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families<i>.</i><i>First 5</i>recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. </p><p>In particular, <i>First 5</i>commits to a Workforce Development Plan to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector. The Workforce Development Plan, work on which began recently, will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. </p><p>Preparation of the Workforce Development Plan will involve close collaboration between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, and an extensive consultation process. To help ensure a strong consultation process, a Stakeholder Group comprising representatives from across the sector has been formed and will work alongside the Steering Group.</p><p>Delivering on a further commitment in <i>First 5, </i>I have also recently appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care systems, funding and quality, economics, and policy experts from a number of Government Departments. </p><p>In Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the sustainability fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order, which I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.</p><p>Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. In April I announced capital funding for service providers who sign up to the National Childcare Scheme. This funding allowed service providers to purchase ICT support which will assist them in recording and reporting children&rsquo;s attendance.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are also working with Pobal to ensure that outstanding applications are processed as fast as possible and to remedy the causes of the delays.</p>  <p>  In addition, officials in my Department are in the process of finalising a Focused Policy Assessment of the ECCE Higher Capitation payments, which includes analysis of administrative procedures used in the processing of applications. It is hoped that this report, once finalised, will inform decisions on how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Higher Capitation payments.</p>  <p>  While I must stress that the delays in the payments are not acceptable, it is important to note that part of the reason for the delays is the large and rising volume of applications, linked to the rising number of graduates working in the sector, which is a reflection of the success of the Higher Capitation payments in supporting the professionalization of the early learning and care workforce. The proportion of ECCE services receiving Higher Capitation payments rose from 20% of services in the 2012-13 programme year to 53% of services in 2018-19. The number of applications has increased significantly in recent years, from 1,562 in 2015-16 to 2,785 in 2018-19. At the same time the proportion of applications approved rose from 83% to 97%. The number of applications approved therefore more than doubled in this 3-year period, from 1,301 in 2015-16 to 2,693 in 2018-19.</p>  <p>  So far (as of 4th November) in the 2019-20 programme year, Pobal have received 2,299 applications, of which 790 have been approved and 2 declined. Of the applications that have not yet been approved or declined, Pobal is actively engaging with a large number of services in relation to their applications. The number of applications is expected to continue rising over the coming months. </p>  <p>  A significant administrative reform took place in mid-2018, with the transfer of administration of the Higher Capitation from my Department to Pobal, thus completing the transitioning of administration of the ECCE programme to Pobal, and enabling early learning and care providers to conduct all business relating to the ECCE programme with one agent.  </p>  <p>  On 19th August 2019, Pobal issued an announcement to services through the PIP system informing them of the Higher Capitation application timelines for the 2019-20 programme year. Regrettably these timelines resulted in a start date which was later than had been indicated the previous year and was due to a combination of resourcing issues and a delay in closing off the 2018/2019 programme year. I understand the frustration the timelines and delays have caused.</p>  <p>  Pobal officials began processing applications for the programme year 2019/2020 in October 2019, in line with the announced schedule. Pobal is currently processing a large volume of applications, and is working to approve applications and release funding as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Considering the significant pressure on services, my Department has made the decision that early learning and care providers whose applications have not yet been processed and who were also in receipt of the first preliminary payment on 23rd August 2019, would receive an additional preliminary payment on 1st November 2019. This payment was for a four-week period that will take early learning and care providers to 20th October 2019. The payment was based on a child&rsquo;s Full Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers for the week ending 18th November 2019 using the max FTE cap for services which were approved for Higher Capitation last year.</p>  <p>  A further preliminary payment will be made on 8th November 2019 for any early learning and care service providers whose application has still not been processed at that stage. This payment will be for a four week period that will take early learning and care service providers to the 22nd November 2019. Early learning and care service providers who had not previously been approved for the Higher Capitation rate but have submitted an application for the 2019/2020 programme year, that has not been processed, received a preliminary payment on 29th October 2019. This payment was for an eight week period. An additional preliminary payment will also be made to these services on 8th November and this payment will be for a four week period.</p>  <p>  For any Higher Capitation application or payment queries, service providers are recommended to contact highercap@pobal.ie who are best placed to advise on these matters.</p></reply>

All youth organisations in receipt of grant funding from my Department are required to adhere to the financial management principles associated with the provision of public grant funding.</p>  <p>  The Education and Training Boards (ETBs), as funding intermediaries, administer funding on a regional basis to youth services on behalf of my Department.  ETBs are required to carry out on behalf of my Department, the financial management and administrative system for the management and monitoring of the expenditure of youth funding and general governance of the funded youth organisation.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that my Department and ETBs can fulfil their respective obligations with regard to public funding it is essential that all ETBs put an appropriate service level agreement in place with funded youth organisations prior to the payment of any funding.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2019, the realignment of the funding intermediaries for the Targeted Youth Funding Scheme (TYFS) resulted in the transfer of the administration of funding for all Kerry youth projects to Kerry Education and Training Board (KETB).  KETB as grant administering body for funding provided under the TYFS in Kerry is required to put service level agreements in place with relevant youth organisations.</p>  <p>  In advance of entering into a service level agreement with a funded youth organisation it is not considered disproportionate for KETB to engage in a due diligence exercise to fulfil its obligations for the financial management and monitoring of grant funding administered on behalf of my Department.  Youth organisations in receipt of youth funding are also subject to audit at any time by an agent of the grant administering body.</p>  <p>  The Accounting Officer of my Department has been in correspondence with the Chief Executive of the organisation concerned and has clarified the conditions associated with youth funding provided by my Department including the necessity for a service level agreement to be in place.</p>  <p>  I understand that KETB has made numerous attempts to arrange a meeting to discuss these matters and I would strongly encourage the organisation to continue to engage with KETB to complete the due diligence process.  This will enable the requisite service level agreement to be put in place and minimise any further delay with the payment of the funding allocation for the final quarter of 2019 which has not been reallocated or decommitted.</p></reply>

Tusla is the independent statutory regulator of early learning and care and school age childcare services in Ireland. In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice.  </p>  <p>  The suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early learning and care settings. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children. In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for the registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration and change in circumstances process, which is available for download on the Tusla website. As stated in this guidance, the guidance reflects the following definition of a competent person for the purposes of a fire risk assessment: &ldquo;A person is deemed to be a competent person where, having regard to the task he or she is required to perform and taking account of the size and/or complexity of the building or works, the person possesses sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work to be undertaken&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The guidance specifies that competent persons for the purpose of fire safety assessments are: </p>  <p>  (a) Architects that are on the register maintained by the RIAI under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007; or</p>  <p>  (b) Building Surveyors that are on the register maintained by the SCSI under Part 5 of the Building Control Act 2007; or </p>  <p>  (c) Chartered Engineers on the register maintained by Engineers Ireland under section 7 of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act 1969.</p>  <p>  In developing this guidance Tusla worked in collaboration with the Association of Chief Fire Officers in Ireland and all of the definitions and content contained therein were approved prior to publication as relevant and up to date. These definitions are reviewed on an on-going basis by Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate, in liaison with the fire representative body, and subject to amendment, in line with statutory requirements, should it be considered appropriate to do so.</p>  <p>  In relation to fire safety audits, fire safety legislation and compliance with it comes under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. The Tusla Early Years Inspectorate liaises with Local Authority fire services where appropriate.  </p></reply>

In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER sub regional area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.</p>  <p>  The LAG may award funding under all themes and sub themes of the LEADER 2014-2020 programme to a maximum rate of aid of 50% of the total project cost to both Private and Community applicants. This percentage may be increased to 75% for analysis and development type projects and to 100% for training type projects. These are maximum rates of aid and the LAG may award lower rates of aid as it considers appropriate. The LAG considers the rate of aid offered on a project-by-project basis.</p>  <p>  Higher maximum rates of aid may be awarded to community-based projects where there is no commercial basis for the project and where the project applicant satisfies certain additional criteria. </p>  <p>  Maximum rates of aid for the LEADER programme are set at EU level.  Each Member State, can if it deems it appropriate, set lower maximum rates of aid.  The setting of lower rates enables a greater number of projects to be supported from the overall funding available. </p>  <p>  The current 50% maximum rate of aid in Ireland for project applicants (whether Private or Community applicants) where the project generates an economic activity is a national rule and was in place under all previous LEADER programmes.  </p>  <p>  Based on an analysis of private sector projects funded to date where the maximum rate of aid was 50%, my Department estimates that the application of a 75% aid rate would have cost an extra &euro;16.5 million.  This increase would have negatively impacted on the funding available to many other applicants for LEADER funding. </p>  <p>  The decision to approve any project, including the level of funding to be awarded and the applicable rate of aid (subject to the maximum threshold limits), is a matter for the LAGs.  The delineation of what constitutes a private or community project essentially hinges around the type of activity involved in each case.</p></reply>

It allows individuals to access a range of government services more easily via a single online account and reduces the need to have multiple accounts and passwords with different public sector bodies.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s eGovernment Strategy, published in 2017, states that the widespread adoption of the Public Services Card infrastructure, including its online counterpart MyGovID, to underpin access to public services by citizens is critical to the successful delivery of the eGovernment strategy.  MyGovID is also essential for Ireland to be aligned with the EU eIDAS regulation, which is a key aspect of the EU&rsquo;s eGovernment Action Plan and Digital Single Market Strategy.</p>  <p>  I am advised that here are currently 1,231,409 MyGovID users.</p>  <p>  The cost to date of IT infrastructure and support to develop, implement and maintain the MyGovID system since its introduction in 2014 is approx. &euro;8.1m, excluding VAT. It is expected that the maintenance costs for 2020 will be in the region of &euro;1.3m, excluding VAT, which includes provision for service improvements and production support.</p>  <p>  MyGovID is a valuable service which forms the central plank of the Government's eGovernment Strategy and provides access to online services from my own Department, Revenue MyAccount services, Driver Licence and Learner Permit renewals and Student Grant applications. I am pleased to note that MyGovID won both the Overall and General Award categories at the recent Ireland eGovernment awards in September 2019.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Acts apply to employees who (with certain exceptions) have had at least one year&rsquo;s continuous service with the same employer.</p>  <p>  If an employee considers that he or she has been unfairly dismissed, he or she may apply to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for a hearing by a WRC Adjudication Officer of a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  If the Adjudication Officer finds that the dismissal was unfair, redress can take the form of financial compensation or re-instatement or re-engagement.  A WRC Adjudication Officer's decision may be appealed by either party to the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Act 1990, as amended provides for the preservation of retirement benefits for members of occupational pension schemes who leave employment before their normal pensionable age for any reason, other than death, provided they satisfy certain qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  Section 28 of the Pensions Act provides for an entitlement to the preservation of pension benefits where a person has completed at least two years&rsquo; qualifying service.  If a person is a member of a pension scheme and has less than 2 years' qualifying service they may be obliged, when they leave service, to take a refund of the value of their own contributions less tax at the basic rate.  In such circumstances, the employer contributions would be refunded back to the employer.</p>  <p>  Some schemes may permit a person with less than 2 years&rsquo; scheme membership to leave their contributions in the scheme, even though they are not required to do so by law.  Additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) are treated in the same way as main scheme benefits.  Even if a person is not obliged to take a refund of contributions and have less than two years' qualifying service, they may still choose to do so.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body charged with the supervision of pension schemes and has the necessary powers under statute to investigate the conduct of a pension scheme should it become aware that a scheme is not in compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act.  Where a pension scheme member is of the view that the scheme is not in compliance with legislative requirements he or she may make a formal complaint to the Pensions Authority. </p>  <p>  I hope the above clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Self-employed workers do not qualify for credits.  </p>  <p>  The Farm Assist scheme was introduced in 1999 to provide income support for low income farmers.  It replaced the former Smallholders&rsquo; Unemployment Assistance payment.

Since 1st January 2007, the exemption from Class S PRSI has been removed and those self-employed persons receiving Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Farm Assist are subject to Class S PRSI as self-employed contributors on their self-employed income, provided their annual income is &euro;5,000 or more.   </p>  <p>  Any self-employed person, including farmers, with an annual income less than &euro;5,000 can pay voluntary contributions to maintain their social insurance record for pensions purposes, once qualified to do so.</p>  <p>  A person aged 66 or over with insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for a full rate State Pension (Contributory) may claim a State Pension (Non-Contributory) if they have an income need.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  It should be noted that only one allowance is paid per household.   </p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;188 million in 2019.   </p>  <p>  I am aware of the MABS report addressing energy poverty among travellers living in mobile homes and trailers and I have asked officials in my Department to examine the recommendations in the report in relation to the fuel allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household payment and can be paid when the residence is on an approved site (publically or privately owned) with planning permission for the caravan / mobile home.  However, where someone lives in a residence which is without planning permission such as in the case where an additional mobile home or caravan is placed on a bay designed for single use, these 'additional' places of residence are not currently legally distinct households which impacts on their eligibility for Fuel Allowance. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I increased the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;2 to &euro;24.50 per week.  This is an increase of just under 9% and will increase the annual Fuel Allowance rate from &euro;630 to &euro;686, i.e., a &euro;56 yearly increase.  This increase follows on from a number of other improvements and increases made to the Fuel Allowance scheme in recent Budgets including an increase from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week and the number of weeks the fuel allowance is paid for increasing from 26 to 27 and then to 28.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it is important to note that, while the Fuel Allowance increase will come into effect from the 6th January 2020, the carbon tax increase will not take effect until May 2020 for home heating fuels, giving such households additional headroom for its introduction. </p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance is intended to address income deficiency, not energy poverty.  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has the role of reducing energy poverty by implementing measures (administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)) to improve the energy efficiencies of Irish homes.  In this respect, the Government Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes can target those most in need.  In this regard Budget 2020 is the first to put a major focus on climate action but has also ensured that the most vulnerable will be protected and supported to participate in the transition. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-05a.2780.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110500109#WRAAA05200"><p>The Government acknowledges the important role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These income supports include the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant and the Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  </p>  <p>  The Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested  social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the payment is to provide an income support to carers whose earning capacity is substantially reduced as a consequence of their caring responsibilities and in so doing to support the ongoing care of the person in respect of whom care is being provided.  In doing this it also contributes to recognising the valuable role of carers and helping to maintain people with caring needs in their own homes / communities.</p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  At the end of December 2018, there were 79,914 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million.</p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Based on the number of carers identified as part of Census 2016, it is estimated that by automatically granting the allowance to all carers by removing the means test, such a universal carer&rsquo;s payment could cost up to an additional &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  </p>  <p>  My Department offers further supports to carers which are not means tested:-</p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) is a monthly payment for a child, aged under 16 with a severe disability who requires ongoing (continual or continuous) care and attention, substantially over and above the care and attention usually required (in excess of that required) by a child of the same age.  The child is likely to require full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.  There are no PRSI conditions and it is not means tested.  The Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is &euro;309.50 per month. </p>  <p>  - The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is an annual payment of &euro;1,700 a year for each care recipient paid in a single lump sum with no requirement to satisfy a means test. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the eligibility for Carer's Allowance would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Depending on the sector the person in question works in, their pension scheme may have its own specific qualifying rules and criteria.</p><p>The interim Total Contributions Approach (TCA) arrangements, as announced in January 2018, work alongside the Yearly Average (YA) method of calculating the rate at which the contributory state pension (SPC) is paid, with the customer receiving the higher of the two calculated rates.  This will continue to be in place until replaced by new legislation.  This approach includes consideration of regulations relating to Homecaring periods which were introduced as part of the interim TCA approach. </p><p>Homecaring periods can be used to help increase a person&rsquo;s rate of payment with the SPC if they have spent time out of the workforce to care for children (up to 12) or sick or disabled persons.  To be in a position to claim these homecaring periods, they must first satisfy the minimum conditions for receipt of the SPC (i.e. have 10 years&rsquo; worth of reckonable contributions, with the first coming before their 56<sup>th</sup>birthday).  Class B or D PRSI contributions, as paid by the majority of public servants recruited prior to April 1995, are<i>not</i>reckonable for State Pension purposes.</p><p>The Roadmap for Pension Reform sets out a target to introduce a new Total Contributions Approach for all new contributory state pension applications from the 3<sup>rd</sup>quarter of 2020.  I have received analysis of a public consultation held by my Department and I hope to be in a position to bring a proposal to Government and make an announcement on the proposed design of the scheme shortly.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore it is not feasible to allocate a fixed time for each case as they are unique in their own way even with clients of similar diagnosis. The Medical Assessor will take the time as required to read, analyse and evaluate each case in the assessment and arrives at the clinical opinion for capacity for work or the need for full time care. Furthermore, the Medical Assessor will take the time to prepare the narrative for the reasoning in the event of a not eligible opinion.</p><p>The Medical Review and Assessment Section (MRAS) in conjunction with individual scheme business sections, co-ordinates and manages all referrals for assessment to the Medical Assessors. </p><p>The Department offers a number of schemes on illness, disability, carers and occupational injury and applications vary in volume and frequency both yearly and seasonally.</p><p>High volume and resource intensive schemes like Domiciliary Care Allowance and Disability Allowance would have a higher proportion of Medical Assessors delegated to these schemes.

As part of the stakeholder engagement programme element a survey will be issued to 33,000 recipients of DEASP disability-related payments.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for a Partnership Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of supports to those who are caring for family members, friends or neighbours.  These income supports include the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Spending on these payments in 2019 is expected to exceed &euro;1.2 billion.  </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018, there were 35,542 people in receipt of a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This is an increase of almost 43% since 2013.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system, one of which is the general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  People qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment for which they are eligible.  </p>  <p>  There are a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  In 2007 a new half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance was introduced for certain people with another social welfare entitlement.  This had been a particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they became carers.  The issue was highlighted by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs in its Report on the Positions of Full-time Carers (2003).  In order to address these concerns, reforms in this area were provided for in Budget 2007.  Under the new arrangements, people in receipt of certain social welfare payments other than Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit who are providing full-time care and attention can retain their main payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which is equivalent to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  Therefore a person who may have an underlying entitlement to another social welfare payment, such as State-Pension (contributory), can transfer to that payment and continue to receive up to a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  These arrangements apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.  Recipients of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance or Benefit are not eligible given the job seeking nature of these payments. </p>  <p>  To pay full-rate Carer's Allowance along with another social welfare payment, as proposed - would involve significant expenditure and could only be considered in an overall Budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that the principal function of the Low Pay Commission is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation regarding the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence-based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness. </p>  <p>  In developing its recommendation this year, the Low Pay Commission assessed various economic indicators such as changes in earnings, exchange rates, employment, unemployment, productivity, international minimum wage comparisons, the need for job creation and the likely impact of the National Minimum Wage changes on levels of employment, cost of living, and national competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  Numerous economic commentators, both in Ireland and overseas, have highlighted that any form of Brexit has the potential to impact negatively on the Irish economy.  Accordingly, although the Low Pay Commission recommended an increase in the national minimum wage of 30c to &euro;10.10, it did so on the assumption of an orderly Brexit, and acknowledged that the Government might wish to reserve its position in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government accepted the recommendation of the Commission in its entirety but decided to defer a decision on when the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation will commence until the nature of the Brexit becomes clearer.</p>  <p>  I intend, therefore, to make provision in the Social Welfare Budget Bill to allow me to give effect to the National Minimum Wage in respect of 2020, in line with the Commission's proposals, once the situation in respect of Brexit is clarified. </p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  </p>  <p>  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers.</p></reply>

This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome.  The HomeCaring Periods can be claimed for any year in which they occurred - they are not limited to years since 1994.</p>  <p>  The interim TCA was introduced to deal with pensioners subjected to new pension ratebands introduced in September 2012 which resulted in a number of such pensioners receiving lower pension payments than pensioners prior to then.  People whose pensions were decided under the previous 2000-2012 ratebands (i.e., those born before 1 September 1946) were subject to a significantly more generous payment regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 52) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of those changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant additional cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out. </p>  <p>  There are five main areas where work is on-going so as to produce design options for Government to consider.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.  The allowance is increasing by &euro;2 to &euro;24.50 from January 2020 following changes announced in the budget.</p>  <p>  A person in receipt of a Social Security Payment from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement (of which there is an Irish equivalent payment) is eligible to apply for the fuel allowance payment on the same basis as Irish State pension recipients.  As with all other recipients of the fuel allowance, the person must satisfy a means test as well as all other qualifying conditions.  If a person is in receipt of a foreign pension other that a qualifying foreign pension as outlined above, then they will not be entitled to the fuel allowance payment.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;9 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments awarded where the recipient is living alone.  These payments include State pensions, disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement and blind pension.  It is not a stand-alone payment. This payment is rising by &euro;5 to &euro;14 from January 2020 following changes announced in the budget. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of a State pension or other equivalent payments from a country covered by EU Regulations or a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement are not currently entitled to receive the Irish living alone increase to that payment, as the respective rates of those payments to people living alone or with other people are set by national legislation in those countries.  There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.</p>  <p>  The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.  My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 448,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments. </p>  <p>  Pensioners aged between 66 and 70, who are in receipt of an equivalent social security pension from a country covered by EU Regulations or from a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement, are eligible to apply for the HHB package and would be eligible for the scheme, once he or she satisfied the relevant household conditions and the means test. </p>  <p>  For the household benefits package, pensioners aged 70 or over who are legally resident in Ireland are entitled to the package without being in receipt of any qualifying social welfare payment.  The package is not means-tested; however, as it a household benefit, only one person per household is eligible for the scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Recipients retain the advantages of jobseekers allowance scheme such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2020 Revised Estimates provide for expenditure of almost &euro;61 million for farm assist (which also includes provision for fish assist).</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 fully reversed the previous cuts to the farm assist means test.  The changes included that 70% of farm income is now assessed as means (previously 100%) which is equivalent to a 30% income disregard, and an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children.  Budget 2020 provides for a &euro;2 per week increase in the Increase for a Qualified Child for children aged under 12 and a &euro;3 per week increase for children aged 12 and over.  These increases will be implemented from 6th  January 2020 and will benefit farm assist recipients with children.</p>  <p>  The estimated cost of changing the farm assist means testing rules so that the first &euro;3,000, irrespective of the source of income is disregarded and the balance is means tested at 50%, is approximately &euro;18 million for a full year.  This estimate is based on the existing number of recipients and current rates.  The number of new farm assist applications may increase if these measures were introduced and the cost should be regarded as a minimum estimate.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to farm assist would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the overall resources available for welfare improvements.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property - other than the family home - and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure. In line with most social assistance payments, deductions permitted for carer's allowance include PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses.  Uniquely in the system, an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week or &euro;665 for a couple applies to carer's allowance.</p>  <p>  Including costs such as visits to the cinema and attractions visits would have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.  It would also significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment.  Any changes in this regard would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  However, the carer's support grant is an annual non-means tested payment made by my Department to carers.  This &euro;1,700 grant may be used in whatever way the carer wishes.</p>  <p>  I recognise the crucial role that carers play in Irish society and will continue to seek to improve the supports for carers.  However, any changes must be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

While it is too early yet to see significant water quality improvements as a result of management measures in this plan, the new targeted approach focused on high risk areas of catchments is expected to bring about an improvement in water quality over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  With regard to compliance with the Directive generally, Ireland received a Letter of Formal Notice from the European Commission on 24 January 2019 which raised a significant number of broad and complex issues in relation to the legal transposition of the Directive. My Department is liaising with the European Commission with regard to progressing specific areas for action under the infringement. </p></reply>

The reports do not currently provide information on the number of people who entered emergency accommodation.  </p><p>Supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.  Rebuilding Ireland is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively.  In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  I expect that the numbers of exits from homelessness will increase again in 2019.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of emergency accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, includes the objective that hotels will only be used in limited circumstances as emergency accommodation for families.  To meet this objective, housing authorities are pursuing the delivery of a range of additional and enhanced family-focused facilities, or family hubs, which offer greater stability than is possible in a hotel, until such time as a home can be secured. </p><p>There are currently 29 hubs operational nationally, offering approximately 680 units of family accommodation.  Of these hubs 23 are in Dublin, with one each in Clare, Cork, Galway, Kildare, Limerick and Louth.  It is expected that further facilities will become operational during the remainder of 2019 and into 2020, details of which will become available as projects are finalised by the housing authorities.</p><p>In general, the operation of family hubs is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.  Local authorities and NGO service providers work with families in family hubs to secure tenancies in the shortest timeframe possible.  Data on the average length of stay in family hubs is not available in my Department.</p><p>My Department is providing capital funding to local authorities to support the development of family hubs. In 2017 and 2018 capital payments amounting to &euro;8.74 million and &euro;21.96m, respectively, were made in respect of family hubs. The funding to be provided in 2019 and 2020 will be dependent on the progress made by local authorities on the development of additional family hubs. </p><p>In relation to the operational funding for the family hubs, my Department provides funding to housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services.  Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources. Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the funding arrangements with my Department.  Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the types of accommodation and the service providers engaged, are a matter for those authorities.  Financial reports from each of the regions, setting out expenditure on homeless services, including family hubs, in each region in 2018, are published on my Department's website at the following link: .</p></reply>

Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Its functions are wide ranging, involving the scrutiny of performance generally and financial performance specifically, supporting best practice, overseeing implementation of national local government policy, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of corporate plans, adherence to service level agreements and public sector reform by local government bodies, as well as any additional functions assigned, or reports requested, by the Minister.  Since January 2018, eight vacancies have arisen on NOAC, of which: four were filled by re-appointment; one by replacement of the Officer of the Minister; the position of Chairperson was filled following a process managed by the Public Appointments Service () and two vacancies are currently in the process of being filled, through another process managed by the Public Appointments Service (), which is nearing completion.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year. All tenants of houses included in the scheme who meet the eligibility criteria can apply to purchase their house, provided they are not disqualified from doing so under the provisions of the legislation.  Reasons for disqualification include rent arrears, participation in a previous tenant purchase scheme or engagement in anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Regulations governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management. It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the Scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are by law (Section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001) independent in the performance of their functions. The operation of the current Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is therefore a matter for the relevant local authority concerned, in line with legislation, including the Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015. Thus, the situation referred to by the Deputy in his question would best be resolved by direct contact with the relevant local authority concerned. </p>  <p>  In the absence of precise details in relation to the prior house purchase referred to by the Deputy it is simply not possible to give a definitive reply to the query raised. However, it should be noted that it was possible to purchase a house from a local authority through a shared ownership option under the then 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme (operated under the terms of the Housing (Sale of Houses) Regulations, 1995). Any person who purchased a home in this way would not now be eligible to avail of the terms of the current Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme. </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister&rsquo;s power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions shall not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.</p></reply>

The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to build your own home.</p><p>With a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan you can borrow up to 90% of the market value of a residential property. Maximum market values of the property that can be purchased or self-built are:</p><p>- &euro;320,000in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and</p><p>- &euro;250,000in the rest of the country.</p><p>This limits the amount that can be borrowed to no more than &euro;288,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow and no more than &euro;225,000 in the rest of the country. These maximum limits apply equally to self-builds.</p><p>Within the maximum loan limits, there are some  rules that set out the limit of funding for self builds. Funding should not exceed 90% of total build costs (which can include site cost where the site is purchased).</p><p>For self-builds, applicant(s) are required to submit with their loan application a valuation report that details the site value, cost of works and post construction market value of the completed property.  The valuation report is required to be completed by an Independent Valuer and will be considered by the local authority in assessing the associated loan application.  </p><p>It is important that all applicants are treated equally.

The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The General Scheme is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>.</p><p>The main objective of the legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p><p>It is proposed that the operation of CIRI will be vested in the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in the same way that statutory registration of Architects was vested in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), pursuant to the Building Control Act 2007. My Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in early 2020.</p></reply>

The most recent amendments to the provisions were incorporated in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 with a view to further strengthening and streamlining the taking-in-charge process. </p>  <p>  Under section 180(1) of the Act as now constituted, where a planning authority considers that a development has been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the planning permission granted, it shall, where requested by the developer or a majority of the owners of the houses involved, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 (the Roads Act) not later than 6 months after being so requested. </p>  <p>  With regard to developments that have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by the planning authority within 4 years of the expiry of the planning permission relating to a development, section 180 (2)(a) of the Act now provides that the planning authority shall, where requested by the majority of owners of the houses involved, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act.</p>  <p>  The most recent amendments further provide under section 180(2A) of the Act that where enforcement proceedings have not been commenced by a planning authority within 4 years of the expiration of the planning permission concerned or the planning authority considers that enforcement proceedings will not result in the satisfactory completion of the development by the developer, the planning authority may in its absolute discretion, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission concerned and where requested by a majority of the owners of the houses in question, initiate the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act. Where this approach is adopted, the authority may apply the security or bond given as part of the planning application for the satisfactory completion of the development. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 180(2A) now provides that the initiation of the taking-in-charge procedures under section 11 of the Roads Act shall not preclude the planning authority concerned from pursuing a developer for any costs incurred by that authority in respect of works undertaken on a development to enable it to be taken in charge by that authority.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the most recent amendments of the section 180 provisions were supplemented by amendments to sections 34 and 35 of the Act. In this connection, section 34 - which relates to applications for planning permission - has been strengthened to provide that planning authorities shall, in the assessment and determination of planning applications, have specific regard to previous developments by a developer which have not been satisfactorily completed as well as any previous convictions against the developer for non-compliance with the Planning Act, the Building Control Act 2007 and the Fire Services Act 1981.</p>  <p>  Section 35 of the Act - which relates to refusal of planning permissions for past failures - has been strengthened to empower the refusal of planning permission in situations where a developer has previously left an estate unfinished under one company name and then re-applies for permission for a new development under a different company name. </p>  <p>  All of these changes were specifically aimed at strengthening the taking-in-charge processes and better ensuring the satisfactory completion of housing developments, and were somewhat informed by a Private Members Bill entitled the Planning and Development (Transparency and Consumer Confidence) Bill 2013 tabled by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to make further amendments to the section 180 taking-in-charge provisions of the Act at this time.</p></reply>

An Expert Panel was put in place to support the evaluation process and its membership includes Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation. The Expert Panel has made recommendations to my Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria which are set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. </p><p>On 14 October, and based on the recommendations of the Expert Panel, I announced approval of projects and schemes under the multi-annual programme. Local authorities were informed of the details on the same date.</p><p>Work is also at an advanced stage of development for 2 new schemes to replace existing schemes which assist householders, in certain circumstances, in the provision of on-site domestic water supplies (individual wells) and waste water treatment systems (septic tanks). </p><p>The changes that I have approved to the individual wells grant scheme are as follows:</p><p>- A maximum grant for rehabilitation works of &euro;3,000, which represents an increase of 47% on the current maximum grant amount;</p><p>- Where the local authority agrees that the most appropriate solution is to provide a new well, the maximum grant payable would be &euro;5,000;</p><p>- Recognising the role of the grant in improving quality, the water quality treatment element(typically filtration and UV filtration) will qualify for 100% funding up to a maximum of &euro;1,000;</p><p>- Up to 85% of other costs would be met, subject to the total combined maximum costs of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation or &euro;5,000 for a new well;</p><p>- For clarity, applicants would not be able to avail of both grant amounts, so they would not be able to avail of &euro;3,000 for well rehabilitation as well as the &euro;5,000 for a new well. </p><p>The waste water treatment system grant allows under certain conditions, households to receive a grant to assist them in carrying out remediation, repair or upgrading works to, or replacement of their individual septic tanks.</p><p>In order to ensure greater uniformity with other measures in the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme, the means test that previously applied to this grant scheme is being removed and the level of grant support is being increased to 85% of the eligible costs of installation/upgrade or &euro;5,000 (up from &euro;2,500/&euro;4,000) whichever is the lesser.  This represents an increase of 100% and 25% respectively, relative to the current maximum grant levels.</p><p>I expect that the process for these new schemes will be completed shortly when the necessary regulations dealing with the financial assistance arrangements and related administrative matters are put in place. This will enable circular letters, terms and conditions, guidance and the application forms to issue to local authorities shortly thereafter. </p><p>In the meantime, the existing schemes continue to operate.  Details are available on my Department's website at the following links or from the local authority concerned:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></reply>

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the 2000 Act and is a reserved function of the elected members.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions.  </p>  <p>  Circular PD 1/08 updates the earlier policy guidance issued by the Department and replaced circular letters PD 1/06 and 5/06 which directed planning authorities to develop a policy on taking in charge. All planning authorities were required to develop or update, as appropriate, their policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 on the basis of the framework set out in Circular PD 1/08.  </p>  <p>  My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure which can include stand-alone treatment plants. Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes.  </p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established consisting of representatives from this Department, Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to assess submissions and focus on finding solutions through collaboration between government, local authorities, Irish Water, and the EPA. </p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf.</p>  <p>  The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in streamlining approaches to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water. In this regard, my Department is liaising with Irish Water in relation to the report. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in section 180.    </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan, published last year, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure, commencing with an estimated provision of &euro;6 million in 2019.  The multi-annual programme was initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities in July of this year, followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects and make recommendations to my Department on suitable projects to be approved for funding.

Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively.  In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this year&rsquo;s budget. While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Implementation Plan for Housing First is being implemented to address the needs of those individuals sleeping rough or long term users of emergency accommodation. Housing First enables homeless individuals with high levels of complex needs to obtain permanent secure accommodation with the provision of intensive housing and health supports to help them maintain their tenancies. The Plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 663 tenancies to be delivered by 2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.</p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering permanent solutions as new homes are delivered and house building is increasing at a significant rate.  Under Rebuilding Ireland results are being achieved in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  I expect that the numbers of exits from homelessness will increase again in 2019.</p></reply>

The level of progress being made is reflected in social housing waiting lists, which have reduced by 26% nationally, from 91,600 households to just over 68,000 between 2016 and 2019.  </p><p>In 2018, Meath County Council delivered 437 social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, with an additional 767 households being supported through HAP and RAS, resulting in the needs of over 1,200 households being met across all delivery schemes in 2018. In 2019, as of the end of Quarter 2, this figure stands at 465 across all delivery streams. Since 2016 to the end of Quarter 2 of 2019, more than 3,400 households in County Meath have had their housing needs met. </p><p>In relation to social housing construction activity, my Department publishes comprehensive status reports on a quarterly basis of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas.  The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of Quarter 2 of 2019 and contains information on the progress of over 22,139 new social housing homes, which are currently approved and progressing through planning, design and construction, as well as homes delivered to the end of Quarter 2 of 2019. This report is available at .</p><p>The report shows that Meath County Council - and the Approved Housing Bodies they are working with - have a social housing construction programme of 82 projects already complete or at planning, design, tender or construction stage, which will deliver 1,056 homes when complete.  This programme continues to be added to on an ongoing basis. I have assured all local authorities, including Meath County Council, that funding is available to support their activity in delivering on their social housing targets.</p></reply>

Commercial rates, at approximately &euro;1.5bn per annum, make up roughly a third of local government current (revenue) income.</p>  <p>  Recognising the critical importance of commercial rates, I prioritised the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 and it was enacted earlier this year. The Act modernises the rates system for both ratepayers and local authorities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are required by legislation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. </p>  <p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. The ARV is then applied to each property&rsquo;s valuation to obtain the amount payable in rates. </p>  <p>  The independent Commissioner for Valuation is currently conducting a national programme of revaluation to provide consistent, up-to-date valuations so that rates are equitably distributed. Revaluation results in a redistribution of the commercial rates liability between ratepayers. While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the commercial rates collected. </p>  <p>  After a revaluation of a local authority area the Minister is required to make a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) to ensure that the overall rates collected in that area for the following year, does not increase beyond normal inflation and buoyancy to take account of new valuations.  RLOs have been made for each of the 16 local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and will be made in the coming weeks in respect of the eight local authorities where revaluations concluded this year. </p>  <p>  The final tranche of revaluations should be completed by 2021. At all stages of the process, ratepayers are consulted and informed and can bring relevant information to bear on the valuation. Ultimately ratepayers have a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. In terms of revaluations to date, I understand that the trend is that approximately 60% of ratepayers have experienced a decrease.</p>  <p>  Local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulties with the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities may facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options. The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 will further facilitate such flexible approaches, provided ratepayers engage with the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Act also provides for rates alleviation schemes, to be decided by local authority members in order to promote national and/or local policy objectives, including for example, the implementation of the Government's Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.</p>  <p>  My Department recently wrote to all local authorities highlighting the new alleviation provisions, contained in the 2019 Act, indicating that the work in respect of commencing Section 15, is underway. Local authorities were further advised that if they plan to implement an alleviation scheme in 2020, they should make a provision in their budget. </p></reply>

The Nitrates Directive requires all member states to define set periods when the land application of fertiliser, including slurry, is not allowed and in Ireland the closed season commenced on 15 October.</p>  <p>  The closed periods for land application of fertiliser in Ireland were decided following extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission as Ireland introduced the Nitrates Action Programme.  The provisions of the Regulations are underpinned by scientific research and good agricultural practice. The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s ongoing Agricultural Catchments Programme have provided further evidence in support of regulating spreading periods as an effective means of reducing nutrient losses to waters.</p>  <p>  The closed period protects water from pollution by excessive fertilisers flowing from farmland into surface water and groundwater.</p>  <p>  While there have been some challenging weather conditions across the country, particularly in August and September, and including conditions in counties Cavan and Monaghan, farmers are required to provide sufficient slurry storage. In the lead up to the start of the closed period in October 2019, my Department kept this issue under review &ndash; in close consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine -  and it was considered that changes should not be made to the slurry spreading deadline. </p>  <p>  In cases of animal welfare issues arising from tanks that have reached capacity, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine operates an animal welfare helpline Lo-call 076 1064408, along with a dedicated email address, AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie. Farmers contacting the helpline will be advised to provide details of animal welfare issues, their herd number and other relevant data.</p></reply>

In recent weeks, Monaghan County Council has submitted additional properties for inclusion under the programme, which have now also been approved for funding subject to the conditions attaching to the programme.  </p>  <p>  While my Department is supportive of local authorities in bringing vacant social homes back to productive use under the voids programme,  it is of concern if the increased level of submissions being made by them, arises from a reduced funding commitment on their part, to the maintenance and re-letting of their own housing stock. The management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under the Housing Acts.  To facilitate the early re-letting of social homes when an existing tenant leaves a property, it is vital that local authorities make provision in their own budget, for pre-letting works.  I hope that Council members will support this important work in setting future budgets.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations. </p><p>In relation to products, Part D of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations. Technical Guidance Document (TGD) D provides guidance on means of demonstrating products are fit for purpose, this includes products which bear a CE Marking in accordance with the provisions of the Construction Products Regulation (). </p><p>Under the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product (which is covered by harmonised European standards or European Technical Assessments) on the EU market, to make a Declaration of Performance and affix the CE mark. In broad terms, this means that manufacturers are required to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products. For many construction products, the application of the CE mark will require the involvement of a third party (known as a &lsquo;notified body&rsquo;) to undertake certain tasks as specified in the harmonised European standard.  These tasks may include activities such as initial type-testing of products, inspection of factory production control and surveillance of factory production control.  </p><p>In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations, which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of harmonised European standards, and accompanying Standard Recommendations, in place in respect of insulation products, aggregates, as well as for precast concrete products and masonry products which may require aggregates for their manufacture. </p><p>In the first instance, it is a matter for owners, designers and builders, with responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulation, to specify the particular project specific performance requirements of products in the context of the conditions in which they are to be used.  In addition, during construction such steps as are necessary should be taken to ensure that the products provided meet these specifications and are suitable for the purpose for which they are intended. Guidance is provided in relation to this in the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, which is available at the following link: </p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. Building control authorities are also designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR. Similarly, market surveillance authorities are provided with wide-ranging powers to ensure that construction products placed on the market comply with the requirements set out in the CPR. These include the issuing of a notice to require corrective actions and in the event of a serious risk being identified, powers that would lead to prohibiting or restricting a construction product from being made available on the market. Issues that arise in relation to products and materials, have been and continue to be dealt with by the relevant local authorities using the powers above, this has been the case in particular in relation to product such as aggregates, concrete blocks and insulation. </p><p>The National Building Control Office (NBCO), within Dublin City Council, provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. My Department is working with the NBCO and other relevant authorities to strengthen the market surveillance function. For example, work is being advanced with Geological Survey Ireland, as a competent authority, to address quarried products.</p></reply>

It supplements income from commercial rates, from the provision of goods and services and from government grants. Local authorities&rsquo; cost and income bases vary significantly from one another, as do their LPT bases, and their abilities to raise revenue from other sources. </p><p>In 2019, 80% or &euro;393.8m of the overall LPT allocation is being used at the discretion of local authorities to support the provision of local services which benefit citizens directly such as parks, libraries, leisure amenities, fire and emergency services, street lighting, maintenance and cleaning of streets.  In addition,  20% or &euro;109.3m of LPT is supporting Housing and Roads services in 2019, supplementing the considerable exchequer funding also provided for these important services. Apart from these specific self-funding allocations, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities including how to spend its LPT allocation. </p><p>In 2020, I expect that LPT allocations will increase to &euro;516.8m. The increase is accounted for, in the most part, by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase their LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020.  When a local authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%), it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in the local authority area. Likewise, when the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the income that would have been collected. The 19 local authorities that voted to increase their LPT above the basic rate are expected to gain &euro;19.7m in additional LPT income for their own use in 2020. The equivalent LPT gain over the basic rate for the same authorities in 2019 was &euro;3.4m.</p><p>LPT allocations to local authorities for 2020 and previous years are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: and .</p><p>Taxation policy, including in respect of LPT,  is in the first instance a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. In this regard, a &lsquo;Review of Local Property Tax&rsquo; was published by the Department of Finance in March of this year and referred by Minister Donohoe to the Budgetary Oversight Committee for its consideration. Chapter 2  and Appendix B of the LPT Review  provide a more detailed outline of  LPT as a funding source for local authorities: </p><p>.</p></reply>

Therefore, the IPI Study visit was not exclusive to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and included officials from a number of different planning authorities and my Department.</p>  <p>  The purpose of events such as these are to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and best practice.  This provides a useful context for key officials, from both a development management and policy formulation perspective.  While I am not in a position to provide an overall assessment of this event from the perspective of the IPI, my officials found it useful to see practical examples of varied forms of different urban regeneration and densification.</p>  <p>  The topic of urban densification, was also the theme of a conference London Irish Town Planners Network, at which I spoke.  The Irish delegates on the IPI study trip were also invited to attend this event, which provided a useful forum for discussion and information exchange and will assist in contributing to future policy development.</p>  <p>  At the event, I outlined the principal policies of the Government in relation to the best use of land for the building of houses, including the importance of compact growth for regional, urban and rural development, are set out in the National Planning Framework and in the three Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs).  The RSESs, are likely to be finalised by the end of this year, after which, a review of County and City development plans will complete the local policy context.</p></reply>

It also served as an opportunity to encourage the pool of qualified and experienced Irish Planners working in London to consider return to Ireland.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, including the National Planning Framework, the Government identified the achievement of compact growth as a key mechanism to support the future sustainable development of our cities and towns, addressing issues such as regional development, urban sprawl, long-distance commuting, housing supply and climate action.</p><p>The densification of settlements is an important part of achieving compact growth, and events such as that in London, provide an opportunity to discuss and debate the issues.  </p><p>Last year, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), my Department published updated apartment planning guidelines and new building height guidelines in order to encourage compact, sustainable growth in our urban areas and to further support the delivery of apartment development.</p><p>The updated <i>Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities</i>respond to changing housing need and a more dynamic urban employment market, including an aging, more diverse and internationally mobile population.  </p><p>The updated guidelines also set out policy in relation to a range of apartment types needed to meet the accommodation needs of a variety of household types and sizes.  This includes the introduction of the possibility of a &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Co-Living&rsquo; format.  </p><p>This format, which is only one element of the guidelines, is a particular form of development that may be appropriate where responding to an identified urban housing need at particular locations.  However, co-living is not envisaged as an alternative or replacement to the more conventional apartment development.</p><p>While the apartment guidelines overall are designed to underpin compact growth objectives, the co-living format is intended to meet a very specific need.  </p><p>In conclusion, the apartment guidelines stipulate that planning authorities strike a balance between the need to provide a particular format of accommodation to respond to a specific housing need in an urban location and the overall requirement to provide quality urban apartment development as a viable long term housing option.  This is, of course, in the overall context of a range of urban and rural housing formats.</p></reply>

The extra &euro;23 million represents an increase of 27% in exchequer support for local authorities to meet additional pay and pension costs arising from national pay agreements.</p>  <p>  While there is a headline reduction on the 2019 budget allocation of &euro;185m to the Fund, this is due to a reduction in the exchequer supports required by local authorities in 2020. The realignment of support for Local Government in 2020 is largely as a result of the valuation of Irish Water as a global utility liable for commercial rates from 2020. As a consequence of this, there is no longer a requirement for general water rates compensation in 2020 of circa &euro;47m. </p>  <p>  I expect that the local authority sector will collect a broadly similar amount through commercial rates as was received in previous years through exchequer funded water rates compensation. I expect that in some cases, individual local authorities will receive more in commercial rates than they received in compensation, and I accept that some local authorities will receive less. My Department is actively monitoring the financial impact of this transition on individual local authorities, in the context of their overall financial position. </p>  <p>  It is expected that Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations of &euro;516.8m will be made from the Fund in 2020 (an increase from &euro;503m in 2019). The increase in LPT allocations is accounted for, in the most part, by the decisions of 19 local authorities to increase their LPT rates above the basic rate for 2020.</p></reply>

However, the recent review of these arrangements  highlights that while they have generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected for the benefits being provided. </p>  <p>  The Review Group noted that, of the 49 SHD permissions granted between January 2018 and 30 June 2019, only 18 (37%) had been activated in some way, either through enabling works or commencement of housing construction. While the majority of the SHD permissions granted are less than one year old, and this could be a relevant consideration regarding the current low activation rate, the Review Group recommended that the Department should continue to monitor the rate of activation of SHD permissions for a further period and if the activation rate does not increase, to circa 80%, consideration could be given to the introduction of a policy measure such as a &ldquo;use-it-or-lose-it&rdquo; provision to incentivise the commencement of works.</p>  <p>  I have noted the finding of the Review Group regarding the lower than anticipated activation rates on foot of SHD permissions granted to date. Given the benefits for developers with regard to time savings and consistency in decision making, and taking into account the significant public resources invested in the SHD arrangements, I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission, in order to ensure the objectives of the SHD arrangements are more clearly met. </p>  <p>  Taking account of the relatively lower than expected activation rate of SHD permissions to date, and with a view to reducing the scope for the potential hoarding of sites with SHD permissions for the purpose of increasing site values, and notwithstanding the Review Group&rsquo;s recommendation to continue monitoring the activation rate for a further period, I consider that it would be timely to introduce a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; measure now. Arising from the introduction of such measure, developers in receipt of an SHD planning permission will be required to commence a certain level of development works within 18 months of the grant of permission, otherwise the permission will lapse. The necessary legislation to bring this into effect will be urgently progressed. </p></reply>

In addition, the Government's commitment to the delivery of social housing homes is evident from the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which provides for the delivery of 112,000 new social homes over the next decade, supported by capital funding of &euro;11.6 billion.  </p><p>All local authorities are being funded to significantly increase their delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland and a strong social housing construction pipeline is in place for local authorities and approved housing bodies. Social housing delivery targets for all local authorities have been set under Rebuilding Ireland to 2021 and are publicly available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .  Progress against these targets is tracked on a quarterly basis, with details published on my Department's website at .  Details of the number of houses delivered in each local authority area, including construction and acquisition, are also available at that link.  All such new social homes as they are delivered, are allocated to families and people of the social housing waiting lists of the local authorities.</p><p>The social housing delivery targets set for each local authority are in proportion to their waiting lists.  Accordingly, as progress is made by each authority against their delivery targets, this will proportionally benefit those on individual waiting lists.  The most recently available Summary of Social Housing Assessments relates to 2018 and, at national level, the number of households on the waiting list had decreased by 13,941 (-16.2%), compared to the previous assessment in June 2017, with 29 of the 31 local authorities reporting a decrease. </p><p>A strong social housing construction pipeline is in place, with a detailed breakdown of this contained in the Social Housing Construction Status Report which is updated and published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 2 of 2019, is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at . The Quarter 2 report reflected an increase in the scale of the social housing build programme, with over 1,500 schemes (or phases of schemes) in place, delivering over 22,000 new social housing homes. Of this total, over 7,300 new homes have already been delivered up to Quarter 2 of 2019, while over 6,400 additional new homes were under construction.  Over 2,700 further homes were at the final pre-construction stage and the remainder were progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.</p><p>The timing, delivery and tenanting of new social housing schemes is a matter in the first place for each local authority. I am pleased to see the progress being made on projects, building on what has been already delivered, but I am keen that all local authorities further accelerate their programmes and I have assured them that the necessary funding is available to support their work in this regard.</p></reply>

The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The most recently published report, in respect of September 2019, shows that there were a total of 10,397 individuals in emergency accommodation, including 6,524 adults and 3,873 dependants (including 1,756 families). Data in relation to families and dependants are not collated on a county basis by my Department but are available at regional level and are published on my Department's website at the following link:  </p><p>.</p><p>Supporting families experiencing homelessness is a priority for this Government. In 2016, the Government published the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.Rebuilding Ireland is designed to significantly increase the supply of social housing by 50,000 homes in the period to 2021, double the output of overall housing to at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2020, support all tenure types (social, private and rental), and tackle homelessness comprehensively.  In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.</p><p>Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this year&rsquo;s budget. While the priority is to support families to secure a home, the Government is also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is available until a home can be provided.  In this regard, the Government is providing funding to local authorities to develop and operate family hubs. To date, 29 family hubs have been developed nationally, providing almost 680 units of family accommodation.  </p><p>Rebuilding Ireland is delivering significant results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults exited homelessness into homes, an 8.6% increase on 2017.  I expect that the numbers of exits from homelessness will increase again in 2019.</p></reply>

The working arrangement for this four-stage process means that local authorities forward design proposals and costings to my Department sequentially, as they advance the projects through their own planning work. As projects are being reviewed under one stage, work can continue on other stages of that project, as well as on other new build projects. To illustrate the non-onerous nature of this process, a summary of the four stages is as follows:</p><p><b>Stage 1</b>&ndash; Forward Capital Appraisal to verify the business case and basic project suitability &ndash; <i>this is a light presentation of information; detailed designs and costs are </i><i><i>not</i></i><i>needed at this initial stage.</i></p><p><b>Stage 2</b>&ndash; Forward Pre-planning outline design and cost check &ndash; <i>this involves the designs that are required for the Part 8 planning process and the outline costs; detailed designs and resulting costs are </i><i><i>not</i></i><i>needed at this stage until planning permission is obtained.</i></p><p><b>Stage 3</b>&ndash; Pre-tender design and costs check &ndash; <i>this stage arises after the more detailed designs and cost estimates have been prepared by the local authority design team.  If costs are consistent with the earlier stages, then this review will be swift.</i></p><p><b>Stage 4</b>&ndash; Tender approval from Department &ndash;  <i>he tenders have been received and assessed by the local authority and again, if costs are consistent with the earlier stages, this review will be swift.</i></p><p>These stages are the minimum number to allow my Department&rsquo;s Secretary General - as Accounting Officer - to make the annual declaration regarding the proper management of public funds in terms of the CWMF.  It also is what is required to meet the requirements of the C&amp;amp;AG on public funding oversight.</p><p>My Department also operates a single-stage approval process for smaller scale projects and a three-stage process for rapid build/modular build projects, where the contractor is delivering on a design/build basis. These arrangements demonstrate the Government's commitment to the accelerated delivery of new social housing. </p><p>My Department has no interest in unnecessarily prolonging the time involved in these approvals, other than to ensure compliance with Government-wide rules for capital project oversight.  We will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that projects are progressed efficiently, while also delivering high quality design and good value for money for newly built social housing.</p></reply>

My Department is supportive of local authorities in bringing vacant social homes back to productive use and since 2014, under the Voids Programme, has provided funding of &euro;145.5 million to support local authorities in returning almost 11,000 homes back to use.  In addition, during 2019, further allocations of over &euro;27 million were made to local authorities to assist in this regard.</p>  <p>  While my Department will continue to support this activity with significant funding and in pressing the need for early re-letting of vacated social homes, elected Councillors also have a key role to play.  It is important that Councillors oversee the work of their local authorities in this and other important housing areas.   </p></reply>

Also for such projects, the procurement procedures used need to be in line with EU and national procurement rules as appropriate. </p>  <p>  To assist local authorities (and approved housing bodies) in this regard, a number of measures have been implemented by Government. These include the establishment of a framework for the provision of full integrated design team services (Architect-led) by the Office of Government Procurement in 2016, which has assisted local authorities (and approved housing bodies) across the country in reducing the time and cost associated with the procurement of design consultancy services, by offering a facility that has already been competitively tendered.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the Office of Government Procurement established a framework of rapid build contractors (design &amp;amp; build) in 2017, which has also assisted local authorities (and approved housing bodies) across the country in running procurement competitions and advancing rapid build housing projects to site more efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, my Department has also worked with Dublin City Council on the establishment of a Design-Build Contractor Framework to deliver residential developments through the use of volumetric construction methods.  This framework is now available to all local authorities and will open up additional opportunities to deliver volumetric/rapid delivery apartments for social housing use.</p>  <p>  Public procurement arrangements are based on fairness, common sense and transparency and given the vast spending that is now happening for new social housing, it is appropriate that these approaches are followed.  Properly applied, I do not believe that they present an obstacle in the development of social housing and I also believe that the use of various contractor frameworks, which have already been competitively tendered, is an effective way to accelerate the advancement of projects while complying with procurement procedures.</p></reply>

The EPA report of the audit of the recent incident at the plant, published on 30 October, found that the recommendations of the EPA's previous audit of the plant in March 2019 were not implemented.  The audit noted that, in particular, the failure to install automatic shutdown when critical plant alarms are not responded to, was a contributory factor to the incident on 21 October which resulted in a Boil Water Notice for over 600,00 consumers supplied by the plant. </p>  <p>  I am extremely concerned that the lessons and corrective actions required following the audit in March were not fully implemented.  I have spoken directly with the Managing Director of Irish Water, the CEO of Fingal County Council, and the Director General of the EPA to better understand how this situation arose and ensure it does not arise again. </p>  <p>  In view of the scale and impact of the boil water notice and in the public interest, I have also asked the EPA to report to me directly on the conclusions of the EPA investigations and any findings which may require a broader policy response.  This report will include the EPA&rsquo;s view on the causes of the incident; if and how it could have been prevented; and its view on the response of Irish Water and of Fingal County Council. </p>  <p>  I will be meeting with the Managing Director of Irish Water and the CEO of Fingal County Council once I have received this report. In the meantime, Irish Water and the Council must now respond to the EPA recommendations from the audit report arising from this latest incident. </p>  <p>  It important to note that once the problem at the water treatment plant was identified, the fault was quickly resolved.  Since the incident, Irish Water and Fingal County Council have implemented automatic plant shutdown on high turbidity in clarified and filtered water and if there is a failure to respond to a turbidity alarm within 15 minutes. </p>  <p>  Irish Water must now work closely with Fingal County Council to ensure there is no repeat of this type of incident.</p></reply>

It is one of the most effective means of killing some of the most problematic invasive plant species, notably Rhododendron ponticum, Japanese Knotweed and Giant Hogweed and it is an essential herbicide in the control of other noxious weeds. Glyphosate is not broadcast-sprayed on any of our sites. It is used for spot spraying, with weedlickers and for treating stumps. Information in respect of the volume of the product used within the National Park is not retained. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the use of glyphosate within our sites fully complies with the EU Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive, which covers all aspects of pesticide use. The National Parks and Wildlife Service invasive species eradication programmes have, over many years mainly focussed on injection of herbicide into the plant, or application onto cuts made in the stems, rather than spraying, both of which greatly reduce the quantity used and human contact with the herbicide.  There are other methods of removing smaller weeds being used in our sites, for example the Department is trialling hot water weed remover on some pathways in parks.</p></reply>

Historic towns include those of medieval and pre-medieval foundation, plantation towns, planned estate towns and those established around local industries. Each local authority is invited to apply in respect of one historic town with an indicative minimum population of 1,500 inhabitants. Priority is given to projects that are &lsquo;plan-led&rsquo; and likely to make a meaningful contribution to the heritage-led regeneration of the town.

While there are no specific plans at present to revise the scheme my Department is currently engaged in drafting <i>Heritage Ireland 2030</i>, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a revitalised and refreshed National Heritage Plan. Any revision or extension of this particular initiative will be informed by this process. </p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development,  also has programmes to assist rural development.  His Department's Town and Village Renewal Scheme is a key part of the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development and is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Applications can be made under this scheme for funding for the enhancement of heritage and/or other community assets.</p><p>In relation to the second part of the question, County Heritage Officers are employed by local authorities in partnership with the Heritage Council under the auspices of the Heritage Officer Programme, which was initiated in 1999. It is a matter for each local authority to decide whether to employ a Heritage Officer.</p></reply>

In recent years, it has been subject to extensive research by the Discovery Programme, funded by my Department, through which our knowledge and understanding of the site has been greatly increased. </p>  <p>  Against a background of high visitor footfall, my Department has been developing a conservation management plan for the state-owned lands at the Hill and is leading a working group of relevant stakeholders, including the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for day to day management, Meath County Council, the Heritage Council and the Discovery Programme. This work has been undertaken with the objective of securing consensus among stakeholders and progressing, completing and publishing an updated Management Plan. </p>  <p>  The preparation of the Plan has included a monument condition survey to inform the conservation needs of the monuments on the State-owned lands. An online visitor survey, as well as a visitor profile, was also undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology at the request of the Discovery Programme and Heritage Council. My Department is now reviewing all relevant documentation to ensure the Plan fulfils its aim and primary focus with a view to bringing the draft Plan to completion as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Plan will focus on conservation issues and will inform a list of priority conservation and site management actions and measures to be implemented over its lifetime. It will also guide future interventions on the site, aided by the ongoing monitoring of visitor numbers by the OPW. It will concentrate on the lands that are in the ownership of the State and as such, it will not, nor is it intended to, address land use and planning issues in the wider environs of Tara. </p>  <p>  Parking and traffic management, as well as visitor facilities outside the area of the State-owned lands, are matters for the local authority although the Plan may inform related deliberations and actions. My Department is available to advise and assist the local authority with any such proposals from the point of view of protecting the archaeology and amenity of the Hill of Tara itself.</p></reply>

It now requires ratification by the European and British Parliaments.  On 28 October, EU 27 leaders unanimously agreed an extension to the Article 50 process, with a view to allowing for the final ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. This averted the risk of a no deal Brexit on 31 October, by extending the deadline to 31 January 2020. However, if the Agreement is ratified before then the UK exit could take place earlier. </p><p>We continue work to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit.  Even with an agreement, it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU and this will bring change.  It is important that Ireland is ready for that change, both for our citizens and our businesses.  We will continue our preparations for all scenarios.</p><p>As I have previously advised, in the course of my visit to London last year, in connection with the GB 18 Programme, I met with Matt Hancock MP, the then UK Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  I also met with Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs in the course of my visit to Glasgow in connection with GB18.  At all of these meetings, while noting that Brexit negotiations are conducted between the EU and the UK, Brexit related matters were discussed in addition to other matters of mutual interest.  While I again met with Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs earlier this year in Dublin, this was related to the launch of the <i>Words that Bind Us </i>project and did not include a discussion on Brexit or other policy matters.  </p><p>In the interests of completeness I would also like to advise that following the visit of the then Aire St&aacute;it, Joe McHugh T.D. to Glasgow in May 2018, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta  in recognition of, and in preparation for Brexit, agreed a Trade Office arrangement with the Scottish Chambers of Commerce at the end of 2018.  The arrangement, under which, reciprocal trade offices are being established to provide business support services to companies and facilitate investment and trade opportunities, will act as a valuable resource for SME's looking to expand their international business to business partnerships.</p></reply>

In addition, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions affording strict protection to a number of species and habitats. </p><p>Wildlife crime takes many forms ranging from persecution of badgers, illegal hunting of deer species, illegal hunting of hares with packs of dogs generally known as lurchers, trapping of wild birds such as native finches for illegal trade, willfully disturbing or destroying the eggs or nests of wild birds, poisoning of raptor species and the illegal cutting of hedges during the nesting season for birds.  </p><p>While much wildlife crime is local we should not underestimate the dangers involved in investigating it as many perpetrators have links with other more serious crime.  <i></i></p><p>Within my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has responsibility for the protection and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, including species protection and biodiversity at national level.  The NPWS is therefore dedicated to looking after our species and habitats and NPWS frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure.  Some of their work entails scientific research and survey work and the monitoring of compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation and wildlife crime across the country. The team also conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation and investigate reports of breaches of legislation including the various types of wildlife crime I have already described. My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit. </p><p>In the period 2013 to date in 2019 some 80 prosecutions were taken by my Department for breaches of the Wildlife Acts.As far as counties Leitrim and Sligo are concerned while there have been no convictions for breaches of the Wildlife Acts since 2013 in these two counties, it is a fact while bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.</p><p>Given the concerns that I have surrounding the nature of wildlife crime, an internal Wildlife Crime Group staffed by field staff and senior Departmental officials meets regularly, most recently last week. The Wildlife Crime Group has pursued many important initiatives including the organisation of a major Wildlife Crime Conference last year which was attended by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from organisations in Britain and Northern Ireland dealing with wildlife crime. </p><p>I am also committed to ensuring that we continue our covert actions with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the I.S.P.C.A to counteract these illegal activities. </p></reply>
