The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport. These include a postal application system, an online passport application service, in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork and the network of Irish Missions worldwide.The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is 10 working days plus postage. Over 50% of the 100,000 applicants who have used this channel this year have had their application processed within a week. The online service currently accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to further extend this service to child renewals by the end of 2018.    The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through Passport Express is currently on target at 15 working days. Other types of application, which are generally submitted through Passport Express, such as first time applications or applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports require additional security measures including robust identity verification and entitlement checking and take longer to process.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently in its peak season for passport demand with the vast majority of applications being received between February and August each year. The Passport Service is currently processing over 63,000 passport applications. These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is doing everything possible to ensure that passports are processed as quickly as possible. Measures taken to enhance processing capacity include the recruitment of additional Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs); the use of targeted overtime and the redeployment of experienced staff from across the Department to processing applications and respond to customer queries</p>  <p>  The Passport Service does not classify or differentiate passports applications based on the county of residence of the applicant. All applications are processed in accordance with the application channel through which they were submitted. </p></reply>

My officials have engaged with the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice in relation to the concerns raised by the Deputy. A recent NI Audit Office report showed that there are significant delays in delivering justice in Northern Ireland; for example the average length of time from the reporting of a crime to completion of Crown Court proceedings is 515 days (over 17 months) which is twice as long as in England and Wales. In such a context, the time spent on remand is considered to be unacceptably high. The report found that the progress of cases through the system is punctuated by practices and processes that are not efficient and that work against the timely delivery of justice. The report made a number of recommendations which would shorten the time spent on remand, including the removal of the committal process; implementing such reforms would require a locally elected Justice Minister to be in place.  With regards to the number of prisoners currently on remand awaiting trial in the separated regime at Maghaberry prison, I understand that there are currently two such prisoners. </p></reply>

There has been an increase in migration into Spain in recent months.  So far this year over 10,000 migrants have arrived via the so-called Western Mediterranean Route.  The represents an increase of over 50% compared with the same period last year.  We are not aware of any reports of repression of migrants and their supporters. </p><p>There were reports in some Spanish media of a specific case which arose in 2010 involving a national from a South American country.

The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport. These include a postal application system, an online passport application service and in person counter application facilities in Dublin and Cork. The quickest and easiest way for an adult to renew a passport is to apply using the online passport application service.  Over 50% of the 100,000 applicants who have used this channel this year have got their passport back within a week and all have their passport issued within the advertised 2 week timeframe.

These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels.  </p>  <p>  The number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year. This compares to 301 FTE staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year. This year, since these figures were released, over 30 permanent staff have started with the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy the Passport Service monitors passport demand on an ongoing basis to ensure that appropriate staff resources are available.</p></reply>

As such, we have been pleased to see the renewed focus on enlargement that has been provided by the Bulgarian Presidency&rsquo;s prioritising of the European perspective of the Western Balkans. We are glad to see that this is set to continue under the Austrian Presidency.</p><p>We believe that enlargement is a transformative driver for stability and peace, and that it will enhance stability and economic growth in the while also shoring up security on the borders of Europe. Providing the countries of the Western Balkans with a credible membership perspective, which the EU has done this year in its Strategy on the Western Balkans, is therefore essential. We should welcome those countries that are ready to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership. </p><p>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s General Affairs Council Conclusions which set out the progress in relation to Montenegro, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Turkey. These Conclusions reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to enlargement, and its continued belief that it represent a strategic investment in peace, democracy, prosperity, security and stability in Europe. </p><p>Ireland has been a strong supporter of opening negotiations and we are pleased that the General Affairs Council which took place yesterday was able to reach agreement regarding setting out the path towards opening accession negotiations in June 2019 with both Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. </p><p>The Taoiseach and Minister McEntee engaged with our EU and Western Balkan counterparts at the EU-Western Balkans Summit on 17 May and I was pleased to host my Albanian counterpart here last month. From this engagement, it is clear that while challenges remain to be tackled in all countries, the accession process is the best tool to promote reform in the region, while also consolidating democracy and regional stability in the interest of Europe as a whole.</p><p>We share the EU&rsquo;s view that considerable work remains to be done in all countries before accession can occur. Conditionality cannot be compromised and all criteria must be met. Comprehensive reforms are needed in crucial areas in each country, most notably on the rule of law, fundamental rights and good governance. Economic reform also requires progress. </p><p>This is why the EU-Western Balkans Summit was important. In the Summit Declaration, the EU pledged unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans, promising to strengthen and intensify its engagement at all levels to support the region's political, economic and social transformation. </p><p>The Summit Declaration and associated Priority Agenda set out six flagship initiatives in the areas of rule of law, security and migration, socio-economic development, connectivity, Digital Agenda, and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans.</p><p>It is our hope that implementation of the initiatives in the Summit Declaration will lead to deeper continued engagement with the Western Balkans.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  In light of this, the Government has been working with the British Government to consider means by which we can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement, in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  I am in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, as we seek a way beyond the current impasse.  The Secretary of State and I have each conducted contacts with the Northern Ireland political parties to hear their views on how, at this stage, the two Governments can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement.</p>  <p>  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and provided views on their key concerns and issues to be addressed in seeking a way forward. </p>  <p>  In light of this, the Secretary of State and I will consider how best the two Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, can chart a way forward that will give the best prospects for getting the devolved institutions operating again without delay.</p>  <p>  I will continue to engage intensively, working with Secretary of State Bradley and the leaders of all of the political parties, until that is achieved. </p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is the indispensable framework for providing stable, inclusive, power-sharing government for all the people of Northern Ireland and for sustaining our interlocking relationships &ndash; within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland, and between the UK and Ireland. </p></reply>

The details of the plan have been kept closely confidential, but there are some indications that it may be unveiled soon. The resolution of this conflict remains a high foreign policy priority for the EU, as it is for the Government and for myself. There is no intention at EU level to launch a separate initiative at this time, which could cut across the efforts by the United States. We recognise that the US is in a position to play a potentially valuable role on this issue. In EU discussions and statements we have sought to encourage the US in its efforts, and to encourage both parties to be open to any helpful initiative.    In particular, the EU has sought constructively to help shape the US initiative, by underlining that a successful peace plan, and one that can be supported by the international community, must address the needs of both sides, and the basic parameters for a settlement which have been endorsed by the international community on many occasions. I have argued at EU level in favour of this engagement with the US, and have myself discussed and exchanged ideas with the US team on a number of occasions, including on my visits to the region and to the United States. </p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the difficulties facing the US initiative, and I am of the strong view &ndash; which I have expressed directly to US interlocutors and outlined previously to this House - that the regrettable move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem has been detrimental to their efforts. But I believe it would be misguided not to try to support and influence the US&rsquo;s planning for an initiative, as long as there is a chance that it can bring about a lasting peace. </p></reply>

The Protocol seeks to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union that are necessary to protect North South cooperation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as avoiding a hard border.  This is the backstop and the draft Protocol makes clear that this must be in place unless and until another solution is found. In order words, it must be an &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; solution. </p>  <p>  The UK has accepted that a legally operative version of the &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; for the border will be included in the Withdrawal Agreement, in line with paragraph 49 of the Joint Progress Report agreed last December, and that all the issues identified in the draft Protocol reflect those that must be addressed. </p>  <p>  The draft Protocol includes elements on the rights of the Good Friday Agreement in Article 1 and provisions on wider North-South cooperation in Article 8 which are important for the normal daily life of people on this island. Agreement has already been reached between EU and UK negotiators regarding the Common Travel Area in Article 2, which will allow free movement of Irish and UK citizens between Ireland and the UK to continue.   </p>  <p>  Last week, the EU and UK negotiating teams published a Joint Statement, which set out the progress made since the March European Council. Disappointingly, the progress reported on the Protocol falls very far short of the EU&rsquo;s, and the Government&rsquo;s, expectations.  </p>  <p>  This is a message the Taoiseach conveyed very clearly to President Juncker when they met last week and the Members of this House also had the opportunity to raise their concerns with President Juncker later that same day. </p>  <p>  I welcome that, in response, President Juncker reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for Ireland, and that the Protocol, including the backstop, is an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement. This is fully consistent with the strong message of solidarity I received from my EU counterparts, as well as Michel Barnier, when I met with them in Luxembourg yesterday. </p>  <p>  On Friday, the Taoiseach will meet with his EU27 counterparts to take stock of developments in the negotiations and discuss the way forward. Ireland will seek to ensure that the EU sends a clear message to the UK that it must respect the commitments it has made and that, in the absence of agreement on a backstop, it will not be possible to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement as a whole, including the transition arrangements. </p>  <p>  The overriding priority now is to proceed in the manner that is most likely to achieve agreement on all withdrawal issues, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. While this will ultimately be a matter for the European Council (Article 50) on Friday, the widespread view, which I share, is that stalling the negotiating process would not serve this aim and that talks should intensify with a view to making the necessary progress.</p></reply>

My most recent meeting with Michel Barnier took place yesterday, immediately in advance of the General Affairs Council (Art. 50). Such meetings provide an opportunity to take stock of progress in the negotiations and to communicate Ireland&rsquo;s priorities, including in relation to agriculture, with a view to shaping the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position with regard to the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including its Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as the EU&rsquo;s approach to the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.My Government colleagues and I also engage frequently with our UK counterparts. I have spoken with the Minister for the Cabinet Office, David Lidington, on a number of occasions in recent weeks. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and The Marine, Michael Creed TD, recently met his UK counterpart, Michael Gove. Such engagement provides an opportunity to underline the importance of finalizing the Protocol as an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement. </p><p>The draft Protocol includes provisions which foresee full alignment with those rules of the EU's internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  As set out in Article 5 of the draft Protocol, this arrangement would include alignment with the provisions of Union law on sanitary and phytosanitary rules as well as provisions of Union law on the production and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products.  </p><p>As concerns the framework for the future relationship, I welcome that the Guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship adopted by the European Council last March confirm the EU&rsquo;s readiness to initiate work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA) insofar as there are sufficient guarantees for a level playing field. The EU proposes that such an agreement should cover all sectors, including agriculture, and should address, <i>inter alia</i>, disciplines on technical barriers to trade (TBT) and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation. </p><p>Last week, the EU and UK negotiating teams published a Joint Statement, which set out the progress made since the March European Council.

I discuss Brexit collectively with my EU27 counterparts on a monthly basis at the General Affairs Council (Article 50), most recently yesterday. Since the last meeting of the European Council in March, I have met with my counterparts from Sweden, Croatia, Cyprus, Portugal, the Netherlands, Germany France, and this week with the new Foreign Ministers of Italy and Spain.  In addition to my own contacts, Minister of State for European Affairs, Helen McEntee TD, has met with her Greek, Estonian, Swedish, Norwegian and Portuguese counterparts. The Taoiseach has met with the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Spain, and also met with other EU leaders at the Western Balkans Summit in May. The Taoiseach and I met with both the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator for the Article 50 negotiations, Michel Barnier, when they visited Ireland last week. I met with Michel Barnier again in Luxembourg on 26 June in the margins of the General Affairs Council. Further to my own engagement with Mr Barnier, officials from my Department, and in particular from the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the EU in Brussels, continue to have very regular, almost daily engagement with Mr Barnier and his team.In all of these contacts, the Government continues to be assured of the continued support of our EU partners in addressing the unique issues posed by Brexit for the island of Ireland. The solidarity of the EU27 has been crucial in securing commitments and guarantees from the UK on the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border. </p><p>Mr Juncker confirmed the Commission&rsquo;s support for the Irish position in his address to the Oireachtas last week. Michel Barnier has also been firm in his support and has consistently made clear that without a backstop, there can be no Withdrawal Agreement. He has also made clear that <i>&ldquo;this is an EU issue, not only an Irish issue&rdquo;.  </i></p><p>As concerns the future EU-UK relationship, I welcome that the Guidelines adopted by EU leaders last March which reaffirmed EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK.  At the same time, the Guidelines also place an important emphasis on the need to ensure a level playing field, stressing that any future agreement must be based on a balance of rights and obligations. The commitment that the EU is willing to revisit its position should the UK&rsquo;s approach evolve is also of particular importance to Ireland.</p></reply>

The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.   I met with Justice for the Forgotten in April to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government. </p>  <p>  I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department. I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request in relation to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Historical Investigation Unit (HIU), the HIU is one of the institutions provided for as part of the legacy framework of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the prompt establishment of which is supported by the Government.  The Government has welcomed the launch of the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation on Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Past on 11 May, which includes draft legislative provisions for the establishment of the HIU.</p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement sets out that the HIU will take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths in Northern Ireland, from the Historical Enquiries Team process and the historical investigations of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HIU is being established in response to concerns about shortcomings with the investigation of outstanding Troubles-related deaths, which are unique to Northern Ireland. There is no provision under the Stormont House Agreement for a similar body in this jurisdiction. The investigation of crime, including unresolved, Troubles-related crimes, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Authorities will fully pursue any new or additional evidence or information presented to them in respect of such crimes.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to putting in place the necessary additional provisions for the HIU to co-operate with relevant authorities in this jurisdiction.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas in this regard is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality are meeting with Justice for the Forgotten on 4 July to hear their further views on the implementation of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government remains determined to see progress on the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement institutions, on legacy inquests in Northern Ireland and on all outstanding legacy issues, including the three all-Party Motions adopted by this House on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  </p>  <p>  Progress on these issues is crucial in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors and to contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-27a.47.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062700069#WRA04600"><p>The question of boycotts and sanctions has been discussed on many occasions in the Oireachtas.The Government does not support boycotts on Israel. I believe that such actions would be ineffective and counterproductive. They would impact indiscriminately on Israelis, including those who agree with our views on the resolution of the conflict, as well as potentially isolating Israelis from the kinds of interactions where diverse views on these issues are expressed. Successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs have taken this view.    The question of products made or grown in settlements, which are not a part of Israel, is a separate issue. Ireland and the international community regard the establishment and growth of these settlements as illegal under international law, and the EU has taken action to make a distinction between settlement goods, and goods from Israel. In the past, the EU has reached agreement on measures on labelling of settlement products, exclusion of settlements from access to EU research grants, and non-acceptance of Israeli certification for some settlement products. Since Ireland is part of the single market of the European Union, all action in relation to how trade with settlement goods is managed is governed by such actions at EU level. Regrettably, there is at present no political consensus in the EU on stronger action in this area. </p>  <p>  These issues were discussed in the Seanad earlier this year in the debate on the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill, a debate which I expect to be resumed next month. In my contribution to that debate, I stated that I respect the motives of those supporting the Bill, but I also explained why the Government opposes it. First and foremost among these reasons is the fact that external trade is an exclusive EU competence. I also set out in that debate my belief that, even if it were possible under EU law to take unilateral action on settlement goods, taking such a step at this moment would not be helpful to the objective we all share, that is, the end of the Israeli occupation and the achievement of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.</p>  <p>  It is important also not to over-emphasise the issue of settlement products, which are of limited economic significance in themselves. Settlements are a political, not an economic project. Most settlements do not export anything, and the volume of settlement goods arriving in Ireland is thought to be extremely small.</p>  <p>  I have made very clear the Government&rsquo;s strong views on the recent actions of Israeli forces in Gaza &ndash; in public statements, here in the Oireachtas, and directly to Israeli authorities. Ireland has also supported appropriate responses at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.</p></reply>

Senior officials from the Secretariat have twice visited the person in custody in Maghaberry prison, at his request.     I have previously raised the case with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, during our meetings. On 3 May of this year, I wrote to her outlining the concerns which have been aired by Deputy &Oacute; Cuiv and others. In my correspondence, I emphasised the negative impact that the detention was having on the individual&rsquo;s family and on the local community. In her response to my letter, which I received on 28 May, Secretary of State Bradley acknowledged the issues raised and underlined that the responsibility for the continued detention or release of the individual concerned resides with the Northern Ireland Parole Commissioners, which is an independent body.  </p>  <p>  The Parole Commissioners carried out a full review of the case in June 2017 and made a decision to uphold the revocation of this person&rsquo;s license. My understanding is that a further parole hearing on the continued detention is due shortly.  </p>  <p>  The Parole Commissioners are charged with taking into account the obligations on the State of the European Convention on Human Rights in making their recommendation.  This includes assessing the risk to the public should the person remain at liberty.  Those whose licence is revoked under this process are provided with a copy of the independent Parole Commissioners recommendation, which sets out the reasons the licence was revoked.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to actively monitor the case and remain in contact with the NIO on this issue.</p></reply>

The Convention states that signatories shall ensure that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will, unless such a separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.  </p><p>As I stated in my contribution to the D&aacute;il debate, I cannot see any way in which a policy of separating children from their parents in such circumstances could be said to be in the best interests of children. </p><p>In advance of the June 20<sup>th</sup>D&aacute;il debate, I spoke that afternoon with the Charg&eacute;e d&rsquo;Affaires in the US Embassy in Dublin, Mr. Reece Smyth, and conveyed to him the Government&rsquo;s strong views on the issue. He undertook to convey those views without delay to the relevant authorities in Washington, D.C. </p><p>I was pleased to see that, following the grave concerns which were expressed both domestically and internationally about this policy, President Trump signed an Executive Order on the afternoon of June 20<sup>th</sup>, Washington, D.C., time, aimed at ending the practice of separation. I welcome this move towards a more humane practice of border protection and immigration control. </p><p>I very much hope that we have seen the last of this practice and the priority now must be reuniting all of the affected children with their parents, without delay. </p></reply>

It is largely in line with the analysis I received at the time from my Department, on which I based my public statements and my contributions in the D&aacute;il on this awful situation. I stated clearly that the lethal force used by Israeli forces was not justified by the actions of the protestors, that many of those shot had been well away from the border fence and posing no obvious threat, including identifiable medical workers and journalists. I stated that this level of violence seemed clearly to be in breach of international law applicable to a conflict, even if one considered this a conflict situation, which itself is a contested assertion. I also said that an independent international investigation of these events was needed. All of these points are echoed in this report.   The report urges Governments to support moves at the United Nations General Assembly to explore mechanisms for the protection of the Palestinian people. Ireland voted in favour of Resolution 12028 which was adopted by the General Assembly on 13 June, which included such a provision. </p>  <p>  The report also urges Governments to support an international investigation. Ireland supported the calling of a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council on 18 May, and co-sponsored a resolution adopted at that session which provided for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry into these events. The commission is now being established.</p>  <p>  The report discusses the question of accountability for the use of unjustified force. This would be an issue to be considered after the commission has examined the events.</p>  <p>  The call in the report for an investigation by the International Criminal Court is referring to broader continuing issues in the Occupied Territory. I understand that the Office of the ICC Prosecutor is already reflecting on this question.</p></reply>

Three years of war have had devastating consequences for civilians, with allegations of violations of human rights, international humanitarian law, and significant loss of life.  Three quarters of the population are estimated to require some form of humanitarian assistance.  I, and officials in my Department, have been monitoring the state of affairs in Yemen with growing anxiety, particularly in recent days as the military operations around the port and city of Hodeidah have escalated. According to the United Nations, a majority of humanitarian supplies and the vast majority of commercial supplies entered Yemen through Hodeidah and the nearby port of Saleef.  Any interruption of this flow would lead to further suffering for civilians in Yemen.  Humanitarian access is a critical issue, and I have consistently called on all parties to the conflict to ensure that the people of Yemen receive the assistance they urgently need. Commercial access is equally important, since a population of over 20 million people cannot survive on aid alone.  Officials from my Department consistently relay my strong concerns on humanitarian access to the Saudi and UAE Embassies in Dublin, including most recently this month, when they specifically raised the importance of ensuring respect for international humanitarian law, and also a consistent flow of essential goods, even as military operations are ongoing in Hodeidah.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;15.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in 2015. Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed in March this year alone.   Ireland also provides global funding to a number of organisations which are particularly active in Yemen including the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>  <p>  I believe that only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation for the Yemeni people is through a negotiated end to this conflict. Ireland fully supports the work of Martin Griffiths, the new Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General for Yemen, and his team, in particular his efforts to engage all parties to the conflict to come back to the negotiating table. I hope that peace negotiations can be re-launched soon. On Monday, the UN Special Envoy, who is working intensively in the region, spoke with the Foreign Affairs Council via video link, to brief us on his efforts. My EU colleagues and I are committed to supporting his work, we were happy to hear from him to discuss how best we can do that. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also worked in the UN system to raise our grave concerns about human rights in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017, Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution on Yemen. The resolution established a group of international experts to examine the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge stronger international action, and will press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, as well as respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access.</p></reply>

Since its launch, over 200,000 applications for passport renewals have been received online.  For online applicants, the target turnaround timeframe of 10 working days (plus postage) is being met and in 50% of cases, applications are being processed in 5 working days (plus postage).  I would urge adult applicants wishing to renew their passports, whether residing in Ireland or overseas, to avail of the online passport application service where possible.   The Online Passport Application service is part of a wider Passport Reform Programme (2016 &ndash; 2021). This programme is informed by a customer engagement survey undertaken in 2015, the results of which indicated a very high level of interest in an online passport application service. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Passport Reform Programme aims to roll out further online application services for children by 2018, with plans to extend this for other adult renewal categories.</p>  <p>  The continued uptake of the Online Passport Application service, along with the rollout of online application options for further categories of applicants, has benefits for all applicants. As more applications are processed online, resources within the Passport Office can be reallocated towards reducing the turnaround times for other categories of applicants.</p></reply>

The Memorandum of Cooperation to which the Deputy refers was signed in the sidelines of that visit and it provides a solid foundation upon which to expand our relations with Cuba.  The primary aim of the memorandum is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba across various areas of interest, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.  <b></b></p><p>The Agreement commits both countries to promoting cooperation in economic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, academic, cultural, scientific and tourism relations.  Since the signing of the agreement, officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in conjunction with other Government departments and State agencies, have continued to work on growing the relationship across that range of areas. </p><p>Total bilateral trade in goods with Cuba has increased significantly in recent years, including by 43% in 2016. Goods trade in 2017 amounted to the more modest sum of &euro;2.2 million, and Cuba is now Ireland&rsquo;s 23rd largest goods trading partner in Latin America.

Additionally, we will work to secure the closest possible positive relationship between the UK and the European Union.The Good Friday Agreement, of which the Irish Government is a co-guarantor, is the indispensable framework for providing stable, inclusive, power-sharing government for all the people of Northern Ireland and for sustaining our interlocking relationships on and between these islands &ndash; within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and, indeed, between the UK and Ireland.   A number of channels for ongoing dialogue and cooperation between the Irish and British Governments exist, and will continue after the UK leaves the European Union. The Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional cooperation on an east-west basis through the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference (BIIGC) and the British Irish Council (BIC). </p>  <p>  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.</p>  <p>  The British Irish Council continues to work on areas of shared importance, with the Taoiseach and Minister Murphy attending the most recent British Irish Council Summit meeting in Guernsey last week.  Three of the four British Irish Parliamentary Assembly Committees carried out inquiries into the consequences of the UK exit from the EU for various sectors across this island in the last year, meeting with practitioners and stakeholders to hear evidence and further the discourse around this issue of primary importance.</p>  <p>  Other channels of contact and cooperation have developed over the years as the relationship between these islands has grown closer.  For example, in 2012, a process was established involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all Government departments in Dublin and London. </p>  <p>  These structures have shown their value and will continue to evolve in response to the changing circumstances.  In addition, we will also explore other avenues to maintain the &ldquo;habit of cooperation&rdquo; that currently exists where Irish and UK Government Ministers regularly meet their counterparts and work together in Brussels on a range of EU matters. This deeper working relationship should allow for cooperation across a broad range of issues of shared interest.</p></reply>

Senior officials of my Department met the Russian Ambassador last year to convey the grave concerns of the Government, and of the Irish public, at these reports. During the meeting, officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate these allegations, to ensure that any such persecution is ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya.Ireland continues to raises its concerns over the treatment of the LGBTi community in Russia, and especially in Chechnya, through international fora such as the Council of Europe. The issue of persecution against the LGBTI community in Chechnya is due to be discussed at the Parliamentary Assembly later this month, which will be attended by several Members of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p> The European Union continues to press the Russian authorities to ensure that the allegations are fully investigated and that those fleeing persecution are given full protection. In meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, High Representative Mogherini has highlighted the serious concerns of the European Union and its Member States over the allegations and urged the Russian government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the rights of the gay community in Chechnya and elsewhere in the country are respected, in line with Russia&rsquo;s international human rights commitments.  </p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  This approach is also enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. This planning, as appropriate, includes any specific responses necessary according to regional needs and at the county level, including those of Cork, of which I am, of course, acutely aware.</p><p>It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors and examining legislative actions which may be needed at EU level.</p><p>The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116 billion under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions. A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published last November &lsquo;<i>Building Stronger Business: Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and training&rsquo;</i>. In total 34 reports analyzing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The exodus of refugees has been accompanied by credible claims of serious human rights violations by the Myanmar Security Forces.  These include reports of widespread killing of civilians, sexual and gender based violence, arbitrary arrests, and the burning of Rohingya villages.  While any instances of sexual or gender based violence are to be condemned, the accounts emerging from Rakhine State are particularly harrowing.</p>  <p>  Ireland, both through bilateral and multilateral contacts, has repeatedly called for an end to disproportionate security operations in Myanmar and for the protection of human rights of those who have remained in Rakhine State.  Ireland has actively participated in efforts by the international community to press for accountability for crimes and other violations of human rights abuses that have occurred. In that regard, we have strongly supported the extension of the mandates of the UN Fact Finding Mission and UN Special Rapporteur to Myanmar Yanghee Lee, and have asked the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with them and allow them access to the country.  Their work in investigating and recording survivor testimony and gathering other evidence, so that it can be preserved for further criminal proceedings, is crucial to ensuring full accountability. </p>  <p>  There is also a critical need for a coherent humanitarian response to the extremely difficult conditions faced by the huge numbers of displaced members of the Rohingya community now mainly in Bangladesh. This includes treatment and support for those women and girls who have survived sexual and gender based violence. Ireland has actively supported the international humanitarian response to the refugee crisis and we provided direct funding of &euro;1 million in 2017 with an additional &euro;1 million allocated for 2018. In addition, as the 6th largest donor to the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s estimated contribution through UN pooled funding amounted to a further &euro;1 million to deliver life-saving support.</p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, the lead UN agency on addressing gender-based violence in emergencies), which currently operates nine women-friendly spaces in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar District, where women and girls can safely receive a range of services, including referrals to health care and counselling. Ireland contributes to the UNFPA both through core funding and pooled funds.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with EU and other international partners to press for progress in resolving this crisis including through our Embassy in Thailand who are closely monitoring the situation. Ireland will be active on this issue at the 38th Session of the Human Rights Council. </p></reply>

The Passport Service is currently processing over 63,000 passport applications. These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages.My Department has an extensive communication strategy to promote good practice amongst passport holders when planning to travel abroad. We regularly advise applicants of 3 golden rules:   - to check the validity of the passports in advance of booking travel;</p>  <p>  - to apply at least 6 weeks in advance of their travel plans; and</p>  <p>  - for eligible adults renewing their passport to consider the Online Passport Renewal Service passport application online facility, which is a fast, secure way for adults renewing their passport.</p>  <p>  We promote these and any other relevant messages through various means - the Passport Service website, social media platforms, press releases, posters and leaflets, video material, radio interviews with the Director or staff of the Passport Service and attendance at numerous promotional events.</p>  <p>  Regularly updated information on current average turnaround times can be consulted my Department&rsquo;s website www.dfa.ie/passport. Links to website information on turnaround time are regularly posted on the Passport Service&rsquo;s various social media channels. Information on available passport services; comprehensive guides to the various application processes and an online tracker that allows applicants to track the status of existing applications at any time can also be found on this website. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service continues to work closely with Communications Unit of An Post to ensure that information on turnaround times disseminated by An Post staff is accurate and up-to-date.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service makes every effort to respond to as many applicant queries as possible. In recent weeks, the Passport Service has allocated additional resources to the existing Communications Unit. The Communications Unit is a dedicated customer service team that processes applicant queries received via its phone, email and webchat communication channels. Measures take to improve  responsiveness include the assignment of TCOs and the redeployment of experienced staff from across the Department to this unit and the use of targeted overtime. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work hard to promote important messages relating to passports. I am satisfied that the promotional strategies currently used are the most cost-effective way to reach a wide audience.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: Annual Report 2017, which was submitted to the European Parliament and Council by HRVP Mogherini and the European Commission, reflected the EU&rsquo;s position that despite a number of challenges, judicial independence and respect for the rule of law have overall been maintained in Hong Kong.

The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to building on the progress made to establish the comprehensive institutional framework for dealing with the past that is provided for under the 2014 Stormont House Agreement.Victims and survivors have had to wait for far too long for a suitable and effective system in Northern Ireland to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.  Over the last 12 months, I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with all of the political parties to support a way forward on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.  Secretary of State Bradley and I are agreed on the imperative of now moving ahead with the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework.   On 11 May, I welcomed the launch of a public consultation by the British Government on their draft legislation to establish the legacy bodies provided for in the Stormont House Agreement.  This is an important step in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, the full implementation of which will help to provide families with a means of accessing whatever truth and justice is possible in their case and will be an important step towards achieving a truly reconciled society in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  While this consultation is about UK legislation to establish the institutions, legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for cooperation with the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas is advancing, led by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Regarding legacy inquests in Northern Ireland, I have consistently emphasised in my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the political parties the need to ensure proper resourcing of these inquests, and I will continue to raise this matter with the Secretary of State.  I have also urged all those with responsibilities in relation to legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible with the implementation of the proposals made by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Government remains determined to see progress on the establishment of the Stormont House Agreement institutions, on legacy inquests in Northern Ireland and on other outstanding legacy issues, including the three all-Party Motions adopted by this House on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  </p>  <p>  Progress on these issues is crucial in order to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors and to contribute to broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are the cornerstones of any functioning democracy and those rights must be guaranteed. While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Honduras, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp;amp; Trade do raise issues relating to human rights in Honduras both at EU and UN level.Officials also engage with the European External Action Service through its EU delegation in Tegucigalpa and meet regularly with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active in Honduras. </p><p>Most recently, officials met in April with representatives of Tr&oacute;caire, the Latin America Solidarity Committee and a Honduran NGO, the <i>Broad Movement for Dignity and Justice,</i>to hear first-hand accounts of the challenges which are being faced on a daily basis by those working directly on these issues  <i>.</i></p><p>These different interactions play an important part in shaping our insight into the challenging conditions faced by human rights defenders on the ground in Honduras and inform our interventions on the matter at international leve<b>l. </b></p><p>Honduras was last reviewed under the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review mechanism in May 2015.  Ireland intervened on that occasion to express its concern at the climate of violence and insecurity in which human rights defenders operate in Honduras, and asked that adequate financial and human resources be allocated by the Honduran authorities to ensure the implementation of legislation protecting human rights defenders and journalists. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that, in keeping with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, we will continue to closely monitor developments in Honduras in the period ahead and will stay in touch with our various contacts. </p><p>I can also assure the Deputy that we will continue to raise concerns regarding threats to the work of human rights defenders in discussions on Honduras at both EU and international level, as necessary.</p></reply>

I was accompanied by Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy TD. </p>  <p>  The discussion at the summit covered key political developments for Administrations since the last summit in November.  The discussion focused largely on the implications of Brexit, particularly for relationships across the islands.  The Council also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and I reiterated my regret that Northern Ireland, until the Executive is restored, remains without political representation in this important forum.  </p>  <p>  The Council also endorsed plans for a future programme of work proposed by the Environment Ministers and agreed to a new area of work on social enterprises.</p>  <p>  Minister Murphy took part in a thematic discussion on the issues that collectively impact the marine environment of these islands. </p>  <p>  David Lidington MP, Cabinet Office Minister, and Karen Bradley MP, SOSNI, attended the summit meeting along with Heads of Administration from Scotland, Wales and the Channel Islands.  I took the opportunity to have bilateral discussions with First Minister Carwyn Jones and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon; in both meetings we exchanged views on issues of mutual interest and continued co-operation with discussions focusing mainly on Brexit and its impacts on business and citizens and on developments in Westminster and Brussels.  </p>  <p>  I also held brief discussions with David Lidington and Karen Bradley on Brexit and on the absence of an agreement between the parties on re-establishing the Northern Ireland Executive.  I underlined the importance of the restoration of the institutions in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and undertook to continue to work with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome. </p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.  This approach is also enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p><p>It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors and examining legislative actions which may be needed at EU level.</p><p>However, the Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector.  Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department in Budget 2018 for the opening of six new diplomatic missions. A further seven new Missions will be opened as part of the next phase of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint. These thirteen new Missions will be located in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, North America, and Oceania and will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets.</p><p>Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 34 reports analyzing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage on my Department&rsquo;s website: https://www.dfa.ie/brexit/ </p><p>Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. The Enterprise Strategy 2025 Renewed was recently launched and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. </p></reply>

I made my, and the Government&rsquo;s, view of this policy very clear when I spoke on June 20 last week in the course of the D&aacute;il debate on this issue.  I stated in the course of that debate that the policy of separating children from their parents was inhumane and simply wrong, and I urged the US Government to immediately reverse the policy.</p><p>Ireland, in common with all Member States of the European Union, has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which establishes clear universal standards for protecting all children. The Convention states that signatories shall ensure that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will, unless such a separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.  </p><p>As I stated in my contribution to the D&aacute;il debate, I cannot see any way in which a policy of separating children from their parents in such circumstances could be said to be in the best interests of children. </p><p>In advance of the June 20<sup>th</sup>D&aacute;il debate, I spoke that afternoon with the Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires in the US Embassy in Dublin, Mr. Reece Smyth, and conveyed to him the Government&rsquo;s strong views on the issue. He undertook to convey those views without delay to the relevant authorities in Washington DC. </p><p>I was pleased to see that, following the grave concerns which were expressed both domestically and internationally about the use of this policy, President Trump signed an Executive Order on the afternoon of June 20<sup>th</sup>, Washington DC time, aimed at ending the practice of separation. I welcome this move towards a more humane practice of border protection and immigration control. </p><p>I very much hope that we have seen the last of this inhumane and unwarranted practice and the priority now must be reuniting all of the affected children with their parents, without delay. </p></reply>

We are one of three candidates for the two available seats in the Western Europe and Others Group regional group. The other two candidates are Canada and Norway which, like Ireland, have strong records of engagement at the UN.   In order to be elected to the Security Council, Ireland will need to obtain the support of two-thirds of the membership of the United Nations General Assembly &ndash; approximately 129 votes of the 193 Member States &ndash; at the election that will take place in June 2020.   Our candidature was first announced in 2005 and the campaign has been building since then under successive Governments.  I am taking every opportunity to raise our candidature with representatives of Member States and to press the value of Ireland playing our role on the Council.  The official launch of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council will take place at UN Headquarters in New York on 2 July. I will join the Taoiseach at this event. </p>  <p>  Although Ireland has been making its case for election for some time already, the official launch is an important point in a Security Council election campaign and marks the beginning of an even more intensive period of lobbying.   I, along with all my Cabinet colleagues, will be intensifying efforts to make Ireland&rsquo;s case. This political engagement is being supported by my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic personnel.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the direct lobbying of Member State representatives by members of the Government, Irish diplomats and others, an important dimension of a Security Council election campaign is how a candidature is communicated.  Campaign messaging will focus on Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the UN since we joined in 1955. It will aim to contextualise Ireland&rsquo;s UN engagement as part of how Ireland sees itself in the world &ndash; a global island which wants to share our culture and values. </p>  <p>  If Ireland were to be elected to a non-permanent seat on the Security Council our fundamental approach to any agenda item would be to advocate for the core values of our foreign policy &ndash; peace and security, justice, equality and sustainability.</p></reply>

Although the finer details of the trip remain to be finalised, the Royal couple&rsquo;s programme will encompass visits to Croke Park, Trinity College, DogPatch Labs, the Famine Memorial, and EPIC - the Irish Emigration Museum, all of which will allow them to learn about Ireland&rsquo;s rich history and culture.  During their visit they will have meetings with the President and the Taoiseach.  They will also have an opportunity to engage with members of the public, and people from across many areas of Irish life and culture and meet with those young leaders who will shape the future of this country.  Their Royal Highnesses' visit to Ireland will highlight the continued partnership and friendship between the two countries, as well as our shared history and heritage.

With a view to achieving this goal, negotiations have been continuing between the EU and the UK to close the remaining gaps on the draft Withdrawal Agreement, including through detailed discussions on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.   The draft Protocol is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement and addresses issues unique to the island of Ireland. Agreement has already been reached between EU and UK negotiators regarding the Common Travel Area in Article 2, which will allow free movement of Irish and UK citizens between Ireland and the UK to continue.  </p>  <p>  Agreement has also been reached at negotiator level on Part II of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. This relates to Citizens&rsquo; Rights and includes a chapter (Chapter 2) on protecting the rights of EU workers and self-employed persons, including frontier workers, currently in the UK. This will address the situation of non-Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  Last week, the EU and UK negotiating teams published a Joint Statement, which set out the progress made since the March European Council. Disappointingly, the progress reported on the Protocol falls very far short of the EU&rsquo;s, and the Government&rsquo;s, expectations.  </p>  <p>  This is a message the Taoiseach conveyed very clearly to President Juncker when they met last week and the Members of this House also had the opportunity to raise their concerns with President Juncker later that same day. </p>  <p>  I welcome that, in response, President Juncker reiterated the EU&rsquo;s support for Ireland, and that the Protocol, including the backstop, is an integral and indispensable part of the Withdrawal Agreement. This is fully consistent with the strong message of solidarity I received from my EU counterparts, as well as Michel Barnier, when I met with them in Luxembourg earlier this week. </p>  <p>  On Friday, the Taoiseach will meet with his EU27 counterparts to take stock of developments in the negotiations and discuss the way forward. Ireland will seek to ensure that the EU sends a clear message to the UK that it must respect the commitments it has made and that, in the absence of agreement on a backstop, it will not be possible to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement as a whole, including the transition arrangements. </p>  <p>  The overriding priority now is to proceed in the manner that is most likely to achieve agreement on all withdrawal issues, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. While this will ultimately be a matter for the European Council (Article 50) EU leaders on Friday, the widespread view, which I share, is that stalling the negotiating process would not serve this aim and that talks should intensify with a view to making the necessary progress. </p></reply>

A Memorandum of Cooperation between Ireland and Cuba was signed in the sidelines of that visit and it provides a solid foundation upon which to expand our relations with Cuba.  The primary aim of the memorandum is to open channels of dialogue and cooperation between Ireland and Cuba across various areas of interest, particularly in trade and cultural engagement.  <b></b></p><p>The Agreement commits both countries to promoting cooperation in economic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, academic, cultural, scientific and tourism relations.  Since the signing of the agreement, officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in conjunction with other Government departments and State agencies, have continued to work on growing the relationship across that whole range of areas. </p><p>The trade figures speak for themselves in terms of the growth of that aspect of the relationship. </p><p>Total bilateral trade in goods with Cuba has increased significantly in recent years, including by 43% in 2016. Goods trade in 2017 amounted to the more modest sum of &euro;2.2 million, and Cuba is now Ireland&rsquo;s 23rd largest goods trading partner in Latin America. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to support growth in this area. </p><p>Furthermore, the recently announced <i>'Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025', </i>the Government&rsquo;s initiative to double the scope and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint in the period to 2025, is a clear indication of our intention to work more closely and intensely with partners across the globe. </p><p>This initiative identifies Latin America and Caribbean as a key region for Ireland to expand its influence, trade, and visibility, and the development of our relationship with Cuba will be an important part of this work.</p><p>The forthcoming whole-of-government strategy for the Americas and the Caribbean will also reflect the priority which the Government attaches to developing relationships with that part of the world.</p></reply>

Abolition of the death penalty is a prerequisite to membership of the EU which has long committed to campaign against its use worldwide with a view to its universal abolition, as reaffirmed in the <i>EU Human Rights and Democracy Action Plan 2015 &ndash; 2019</i>.Within the framework of the Action Plan, the Foreign Affairs Council adopts Conclusions each year agreeing an annual Strategic Work Plan setting out the EU&rsquo;s human rights priorities at the United Nations.The most recent Work Plan, adopted by the Council on 26 February 2018, committed the EU to continue to support the work of the UN towards global abolition of the death penalty in 2018, particularly at the UN Human Rights Council and the 73rd meeting of the UN General Assembly in November 2018.  The Conclusions recommended that countries who have abolished the death penalty should enshrine this protection in their Constitutions and consider ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The EU also called on countries where the death penalty is still in use to work towards its progressive abolition.  More recently, on 28 May 2018, the Council adopted the EU&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2017</i>&rdquo;, which confirmed that throughout 2017, the EU continued to voice its strong opposition to the death penalty as a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment which violates the right to life, while not deterring crime more effectively than imprisonment.</p></reply>

These are located in Malaga, Barcelona, Bilbao, Galicia, Alicante, Mallorca, Seville, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife. The scale of this representation allows the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide timely and high-quality consular assistance and services to Irish citizens over a wide geographic area both on the peninsula and throughout the Balearic and Canary islands.

In that regard, the Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office last March and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the exchanges over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, I had previously raised the issue with then-Secretary of State Tillerson when I visited Washington DC in February, and with senior Congressional figures. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been very active on the issue, and is due to travel to Washington D.C. again shortly for meetings with key contacts.</p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington DC continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the Administration and with contacts on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>  The Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, also works very closely with Irish immigration centres which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States. Our Ambassador in Washington hosted a meeting last month with representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers at the Embassy in Washington, DC, where there was a very good exchange of views on the challenges facing Irish immigrants in the US, both documented and undocumented, and on the prospects for relief for the undocumented Irish.  </p>  <p>  Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government has been exploring a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other. </p>  <p>  However, this remains a very challenging issue and I do not want to raise expectations unduly.  Immigration reform has been a sensitive and indeed divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people. The recent controversy around the separation of undocumented children from their parents served to illustrate how divisive an issue this has become and how challenging it will be for us to find a solution for the undocumented Irish. </p>  <p>  That said, I can assure the House that the Government, its Special Envoy and our Embassy in Washington DC are continuing to give top priority to this issue, mindful of its importance to the thousands of undocumented and to their families in Ireland, and that we will spare no effort in seeking a solution.  </p></reply>

One person is forcibly displaced every two seconds. Most displaced persons still live within the borders of their own countries but over 25 million are refugees, forced to seek protection in countries other than their own. 85% of displaced people globally are hosted in developing countries, such as Irish Aid partner countries Uganda and Ethiopia.    At the global level, the Member States of the United Nations came together in 2016 and unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which expressed a shared political will to address large movements of refugees and migrants in a more coordinated and humane manner. Ireland played a leading role in co-facilitating this landmark Declaration, and we are continuing on our efforts in its follow up.</p>  <p>  Central in this is the commitment in the New York Declaration to putting in place two Global Compacts by the end of this year &ndash; one on refugees and one on migration. Ireland is actively engaged in the negotiations for both these Compacts, advocating strongly - including within the EU - for an approach which places the dignity and human rights of all people on the move at the centre of our response. Any approach or solution needs to be comprehensive, addressing all aspects of the issue, from the causes of mass exodus to the responses necessary to cover the range of refugee situations.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, there is a well-established body of international law, notably the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, with protections and minimum standards. Ireland believes strongly that these must be respected and is consistent in advocating for this with our partners at the global and EU levels.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant support through our aid programme to, amongst others, UNHCR and UNRWA, which is responsible for Palestinian refugees.  In addition, the Irish Naval Service helps save lives through its actions to assist those who get into difficulty trying to cross the Mediterranean.</p></reply>

Through the generous support of Irish taxpayers, and in close collaboration with the UN, EU and other partners, this funding is making a difference in alleviating the suffering caused by humanitarian crises and hunger, and supporting improvements in access to health, education, agriculture and social protection services for some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable and marginalised people. During my recent visits to Africa and other locations, I witnessed at first hand the impact of Ireland&rsquo;s international development programmes across these priority areas, ensuring on behalf of the Irish people that our aid programme is delivering results for those it is intended.</p>  <p>   The Government&rsquo;s plan to double Ireland&rsquo;s worldwide scope and impact by 2025 will build on our strengths in current priority locations, including but not exclusively in sub Saharan Africa. This plan opens potential to expand our development cooperation in West Africa and to strengthen our relationship with Small Island Developing States (SIDS). The latter have been significantly impacted by climate change. Our ambition in the White Paper on international development will be to continue to lead the achievement of collective global aspirations for a better world expressed in the SDGs. We also aim to strengthen our collaboration with EU, UN, and other partners.</p>  <p>   My Department is committed to ensuring that Irish assistance is delivered effectively and efficiently to those most in need.  Our Embassy network, especially in Sub Saharan Africa and other locations such as Vietnam and Palestine, continue to play a key role in the planning, management and oversight of all Ireland&rsquo;s partners &ndash; including the EU and UN - on the ground.  </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s assistance programme is sharply focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance.     My Department provides development assistance to over eighty of the world&rsquo;s least developed countries, supporting their development needs and responding to emergencies and protracted crises with humanitarian assistance.  We work through a wide range of partners and channels, including partner government systems, Irish and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionary organisations, and UN and other multilateral agencies and organisations.  </p>  <p>  Funding for multilateral organisations is kept under regular review by my Department, to ensure that it is targeted effectively, and channeled through partners who can contribute most effectively to delivering agreed priorities. In this way, Ireland is playing a strong role in supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Multilateral partnerships allow us to reach the poorest and most fragile countries and regions in the world, and deliver real results on the ground: also, through leveraging these partnerships we able to amplify Ireland&rsquo;s advocacy on our priority issues. </p>  <p>  Sub-Saharan Africa is our priority region, where we focus in particular on a number of countries. This engagement is at strategic level, in addition to support for their long-term development.  These countries are Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. Smaller more focused programs are delivered in countries and territories such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Liberia and Kenya. We also have programmes in Vietnam and Palestine.    </p>  <p>  The total Bilateral ODA provided by my Department to ODA eligible countries in 2016 was &euro;386 million, 53% of the total amount of Irish ODA. The total Multilateral ODA in 2016 was &euro;337 million, 47% of the total. Some of this was channeled through other Departments.  The 2017 figures are being finalised. The full list of ODA eligible countries is published annually by the OECD Development Assistance Committee. </p>  <p>   A key principle is that Ireland&rsquo;s official aid should remain untied - that is, not conditional on acquiring goods and services from Ireland.  This is regularly remarked upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee in their assessments of Ireland&rsquo;s international cooperation.</p></reply>

According to the UN, in 2016 445 million people were affected by disasters linked to natural hazards worldwide including floods, storms, earthquakes and drought; 8,000 people directly lost their lives; and immediate economic losses from major disaster events were estimated at almost $140 billion.  Climate change, together with poverty and poor environmental management, means that an increasing number of countries, poor countries in particular, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters. </p>  <p>  A priority for Ireland in responding to humanitarian crises is ensuring that life-saving assistance reaches those most in need, as quickly as possible. Ireland works with our UN, EU, Red Cross and NGO partners to reach those in most urgent need of assistance when crises hit.  For example, in response to the eruption of the Fuego Volcano in Guatemala on 3 June 2018, Ireland provided &euro;75,000 to Plan International to assist with shelter for those affected. Similarly, in 2017, in response to flooding and mudslides in Sierra Leone, Ireland deployed emergency relief supplies via the Rapid Response Initiative to our partner NGOs to help people affected.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland provides core support to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction worth &euro;0.5m to help them build capacity in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries to prepare for and manage the impact of disasters.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance where it is needed most, working with partners who can ensure that such assistance is delivered in a coordinated and effective manner.</p></reply>

The UN estimates that 134.1 million people are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and protection, mainly as a result of conflict but also natural disaster.  The annual Global Humanitarian Overview, published by the UN system last week details the current financial requirements to respond to humanitarian needs in 2018.

The Government of Ireland recognises that trafficking in human beings undermines the fundamental principles of human rights law and that it can only be tackled through global cooperation, partnership and a victim centered approach. At EU level, human trafficking is prohibited by Article 5.3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Human Rights.  EU Directive 2001/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims was agreed in 2011 and has been transposed into domestic law by all EU Member States, including Ireland.  Article 20 of the Directive outlines the role of the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator who is responsible for improving coordination and coherence among EU institutions, EU agencies, Member States and international actors in addressing human trafficking.  She is also responsible for developing existing and new EU policies to address human trafficking.In 2017, the EU adopted a new Communication to address human trafficking and committed to implement a new set of priorities, building on the 2012-2016 EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings.  The Communication&rsquo;s cross cutting priorities aim to provide a stronger response to trafficking though coordinated and consolidated actions by relevant authorities and organisations. The two cross cutting priorities are: the establishment of a sound knowledge base &ndash; understanding the nature, scale and costs of trafficking is key to ensuring appropriate action; and supporting anti-trafficking priorities in the EU and non-EU countries. </p><p>At an international level, the United Nations continues to lead on combating human trafficking across the globe. The UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children was the first international treaty aimed at comprehensively defining and addressing human trafficking and was ratified by Ireland in 2010. The Protocol has a threefold purpose: to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; to protect and assist victims of trafficking; and to promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives.</p><p>The Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2010.  It includes concrete actions to prevent trafficking in persons, protect and assist victims, prosecute related crimes and strengthen partnerships among Governments, civil society organisations and the private sector, including the media. The Action Plan provided for the establishment of a United Nations voluntary trust fund for victims of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, managed by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. </p><p>During the 72<sup>nd</sup>session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, a high level meeting took place on 27 and 28 September to review progress on implementation of the Plan.  The General Assembly adopted, by consensus, a political declaration aimed at combating human trafficking with member states, including Ireland, reaffirming their commitment to the Plan.</p><p>The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also worked towards integrating a human rights based approach into the fight against human trafficking. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has developed Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking that aim to assist those involved in anti-trafficking to integrate a human rights based approach into their responses. The Human Rights Council also addresses human trafficking through resolutions that address the issue both directly and indirectly. For example, at the 37<sup>th</sup>session of the United National Human Rights Council in March of this year, the Council adopted a resolution on the rights of the child in humanitarian settings which specifically addressed issue of human trafficking of children.  At the 35<sup>th</sup>session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2017, the Council adopted a resolution on the protection of human rights of migrants which addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, victims of human trafficking. Both resolutions were cosponsored by Ireland. At the 32<sup>nd</sup>session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2016, the Council adopted a resolution entitled Protecting Victims of Trafficking and People at Risk of Trafficking, Especially Women and Children in Conflict and Post-Conflict Situations, which was also cosponsored by Ireland. </p><p>Finally, among the special procedures of the Human Rights Council is the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, who is mandated to take action on violations committed against trafficked persons; undertake country visits; and to submit annual reports on the activities of the mandate.  Ireland has supported the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, most recently in 2017 through co-sponsorship of a resolution extending the mandate of the office for a further three years. </p></reply>

This is not dissimilar from our own peace process. </p>  <p>  The structures operational in the context of the Middle East Peace Process are numerous and varied. From an international perspective there are a number of special envoys to the peace process, including a UN special coordinator, an EU Special Representative, a US special envoy, a Chinese special envoy, to name but a few. The Office of the Quartet also works as a bridge between the parties supporting Palestinian economic and institutional development and empowerment, a key factor in achieving a two-state solution. Despite the stagnation in the political process and worsening developments on the ground in recent months, there are a number of areas where the Israelis and Palestinians continue to cooperate, including on security.</p>  <p>  For over a year the United States administration has been actively exploring the possibilities for re-launching the process to reach a comprehensive peace agreement. This is welcome and I have met with and spoken to the US team on a number of occasions to encourage their work, and to underline the key parameters for an agreement which the EU has long espoused. </p>  <p>  I have urged the EU to encourage and engage with an appropriate US initiative. But I have also emphasized the need for the EU to continue our own work to help preserve and create the political and physical space in which the two-state solution can be achieved.</p>  <p>  We expect to see a proposal from the US team in the coming months. In that regard it is important that any parameters which are advanced actually provide a basis on which both parties could agree. It remains to be seen what the US peace plan will propose. </p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of the Palestinian leadership in relation to a US proposal. And I have made clear to the US that no peace plan can work without Palestinian acceptance. In that regard I have also urged President Abbas to keep an open mind on the US plans. </p>  <p>  I am not convinced of the need to establish another body at this time capable of dealing with complaints from both sides. What is needed now is the resumption of direct talks, which are ultimately the only way to achieve peace. I am hopeful that the US peace plan, when it emerges, will provide a fair and workable basis for such talks to resume. </p></reply>

In the Council Conclusions on Enlargement which were agreed on Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup>June, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to enlargement and stated that it continues to represent a strategic investment in peace, democracy, prosperity, security and stability in Europe. The Conclusions also stated that the EU is determined to strengthen and intensify its engagement at all levels to support the region's political, economic and social transformation, including through increased assistance, based on tangible progress on the rule of law, as well as on socio-economic reforms, by the Western Balkans.There is a recognition that this is not only a strategic investment in Europe's security and prosperity, but that it can also contribute greatly to the long term stability of formerly war-torn areas in that it helps create a political environment conducive to bilateral issues being resolved, as we have witnessed recently in the agreement between Athens and Skopje in regard to the name-issue. As a demonstration of the EU&rsquo;s commitment, the European Commission recently adopted a strategy for &lsquo;A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans&rsquo;. In this Strategy, the Commission sets out clearly the actions that it will implement over in the short to medium term to boost the transformation efforts in the Western Balkans in areas of mutual interest. These actions are set out across six flagship initiatives which range from strengthening the rule of law, reinforcing cooperation on security and migration and expanding the EU Energy Union to the Western Balkans, to lowering roaming charges and rolling out broadband in the region. In addition, the Strategy  underlines the need for the EU to be prepared to welcome new members on the condition they have met the rigorous criteria for doing so.</p><p>It should also be noted that the Commission proposal for the new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance fund (IPA III) for the 2021-2027 period, envisages a 13% increase (to &euro;14.5 billion) compared to current funding, and also seeks to make this fund more strategic by clearly anchoring it in the context of the Western Balkans Strategy.</p><p>Over the longer-term,  there is a recognition in the EU that enlargement is a geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and united Europe based on common values and that a credible accession perspective is the key driver of transformation in the region and thus enhances our collective integration, security, prosperity and social well-being. </p></reply>

The aims of the Eastern Partnership are to promote peace and stability in the region and to enhance economic and political integration between the participating countries and the EU. The model of cooperation with each of the participating states has been tailored to meet their needs and priorities and those of the EU. At the fifth Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels in November 2017 a revised Eastern Partnership multilateral architecture was adopted to contribute to the goals of the partnership particularly by supporting the implementation of the &ldquo;20 Deliverables for 2020&quot; which sets the future priorities for the initiative<b>.</b>This roadmap identifies a range of short and long-term milestones aimed at developing a stronger economy, governance, connectivity and society to make tangible and pragmatic improvements to the lives of citizens in partner countries.  The Eastern Partnership is viewed as an important tool for promoting peace and stability in the region, in the context of an unpredictable Russia and the conflict in Ukraine.  While Ireland is aware of the wider geopolitical considerations at play in the region, we have sought to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s values continue to guide our approach and that the Eastern Partnership continues to incentivise reform and progress.</p><p>The EU is committed to assisting Ukraine in delivering its ambitious and wide-ranging programme of reform and has provided unprecedented levels of support. This assistance includes loans, budget support, humanitarian aid, and technical assistance as well as important trade preferences, granted under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement which came into force in 2016. In addition, the EU is helping to reform the civilian security sector through its Advisory Mission to Ukraine.</p><p>The EU continues to support efforts by the OSCE to secure full implementation of the Minsk peace agreements, which provide the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the four year conflict in eastern Ukraine. On a visit to Ukraine in March, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s unwavering support for Ukraine&rsquo;s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and called on all parties to the conflict to support the vital work of international humanitarian organisations in meeting the needs of the local populations living in close proximity to the contact line as well as the large numbers of Internally Displaced Persons. </p><p>As with Ukraine, the EU remains committed to its political association and economic integration with Georgia and the successful implementation of the Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The EU has praised Georgia's reform efforts while underlining the need to ensure sustainability of the changes which have already taken place including on democratic development and fundamental freedoms, on constitutional and parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption reforms.</p><p>The EU also fully supports Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The appointment in November 2017 of a new EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, as well as the EU Monitoring Mission are visible and substantial signs of the Union's commitment to helping Georgia address its security challenges.</p><p>The European Union continues to have positive relations with Armenia, which receives considerable funding from the EU, with up to &euro;170 million allocated for the period 2014-2017. This was focused on supporting private sector development and driving reforms in the areas of public administration and justice.

Where an individual is entitled to the State pension and such pension is increased by virtue of that individual having a qualifying adult dependant, it remains one pension for tax purposes.</p>  <p>  This position was not changed by Finance (No.2) Act 2013, which inserted Section 126(2B) into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to re-affirm the position that any such increase is treated as the income of the person who qualifies for the pension.  Entitlement to the State pension and any associated adult dependant allowance is based on PRSI contributions made by an individual and it is the choice of the individual pensioner whether to claim an increase for an adult dependant.  The relevant income is therefore classed as that individual&rsquo;s income solely, notwithstanding the fact that the dependant element of the pension may be paid directly to the qualifying dependant. </p>  <p>  With regard to the taxation of the State pension in general, I would note that all social welfare payments are exempt from USC.  Furthermore, a pensioner with an adult dependent that is solely in receipt of the State Contributory Pension, payable at the maximum rate, would in fact have no liability to income tax or USC at all, as the available income tax credits, including the Age Credit available to individuals aged 65 and over, would be sufficient to shelter the income from taxation.</p>  <p>  There are therefore no plans to change this position.  I would however note that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2018 mean that individuals who paid income tax and/or USC in 2017 will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2018 where incomes are equal. This is the fourth Budget in succession in which income tax reductions have been introduced, focussed particularly on low to middle-income earners.</p></reply>

Awards were made following applications from survivors who provided evidence of having been in a specified institution and evidence also of injury arising out of abuse suffered while in residence. The amount of an award was determined by reference to the Board&rsquo;s assessment of the severity of the abuse and the consequential injury. A Residential Institutions Review Committee was set up to review decisions and awards made by the Redress Board. </p>  <p>  Redress schemes offer victims a potentially faster and less onerous justice process.   This is acknowledged in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report 96 on the Cost of Child Abuse Inquiry and Redress which states that &lsquo;The setting up of a redress scheme following the work of the Commission (to Inquire into Child Abuse) provided reparation to those who had suffered abuse in the institutions. Without such a scheme, civil litigation cases taken by former residents through the courts system could have resulted in substantially higher legal costs and could have led to a backlog of cases for many years as a result.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Redress Board as established by the Oireachtas under the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, was to make awards to the survivors of abuse. The statutory functions of the board as set out in section 5 of that Act include a requirement to &ldquo;ensure in so far as is practicable, that hearings are conducted as informally as possible having regard to all the circumstances. The &ldquo;forensic style examination&rdquo; referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question would clearly be at variance with this provision. </p></reply>

This is the reason why I established the Working Group in March 2017 to develop a plan that would safeguard the future of the Castlebar campus. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Working Group was published in December 2017. It provides a wide-ranging assessment of the context within which the Campus is currently operating, and outlines a proposed vision for the future of the Mayo Campus. The Working Group recommendations are primarily for GMIT to implement, including those with regard to course provision at the Castlebar campus. </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the Sustainability Plan is that the Digital Media programme be re-pitched, in collaboration with industry, for the 2018/19 academic year. I understand that this recommendation has yet to be implemented by GMIT. In the interim GMIT retained the programme it as a CAO offering for 2018/19. However, predictive analysis carried out by GMIT determined that there was an insufficient number of applicants to make the programme viable. On that basis GMIT have taken the decision to suspend the programme for the 2018/19 academic year. </p>  <p>  While GMIT took the decision to withdraw this course, it should be noted that the institute has reinstated other programmes at the Castlebar campus for 2018/19 - Sustainable Building Technology and the Heritage related programmes of History and Geography and Culture &amp;amp; Environment - subject to a viable number of applicants. </p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be implemented over the next five years, over the period 2018-2022. Formal progress reports will be submitted to the GMIT Governing Body and the HEA every four months for review.   I would like to again assure the Deputy that my Department and the HEA will continue to work closely with GMIT on ensuring that the recommendations of the Working Group are implemented as soon as possible, and with appropriate consultation with relevant stakeholders, to ensure the future sustainability and success of the Castlebar campus. </p></reply>

Gross income before the deduction of income tax or the universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded. </p><p>The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. Also, in recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families. </p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.

As part of contingency planning arrangements, officials from my Department and the relevant ETBs met with the contractor and the examiner in mid-April to discuss their plans to deliver the outstanding school projects.  While work was continuing on one project, work has ceased on three other projects and these contracts were terminated in early May.  The final contract was terminated upon the liquidation of the contractor in June 2018.</p>  <p>  In the case of all projects, steps have been taken to put alternative arrangements in place and I have requested my officials to provide me with a critical path for the completion of the outstanding projects and to consider how each stage in that critical path can be delivered as quickly as possible while also ensuring that the quality and integrity of the project is fully protected.  Etender notices have already been published seeking expressions of interest from contractors wishing to be considered for the completion of two of the projects and a further eTenders will be published later this week in respect of the third project.  Identification of all outstanding works necessary to complete all schools is also on-going.  This is the normal process followed when an insolvency event occurs.  </p></reply>

All of the applications that were declined were advised that they could apply to Mr Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, the independent assessor I appointed in November 2017, for an independent assessment of their application.   21 people have applied for this assessment.</p>  <p>  Mr Justice O&rsquo;Neill has looked for a submission on: &lsquo;whether the imposition of the condition which required that there had to be evidence of a prior complaint of child sexual abuse on the part of the employee in question to the school authority (or a school authority in which the employee has previously worked), to establish eligibility for a payment under the ex gratia scheme, is consistent with and a correct implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe v. Ireland&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The submission forwarded to Mr Justice O&rsquo;Neill on 27th April was prepared with the advice and assistance of the Attorney General and Senior Counsel and is now published on the Department's website.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015. </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the DSS and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought into operation on 17 October 2016 some provisions of Part 8 of the Act relating to advance healthcare directives. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to advise in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives.</p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the DSS is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  The Director is also working in a very determined way to get the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations in place in order that the Decision Support Service can be up and running as quickly as possible. There are many complex strands to this work, including involvement of multiple organisations. </p>  <p>  Every effort is underway to ensure that the Decision Support Service has all necessary capacity to open for business as soon as possible. My Department has received an outline implementation plan from the Director which contains monthly milestones for realisation of the objective of an active DSS.  As time goes on, every effort will be made by all sides to achieve tightening of the timeframes where possible and the situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Steering Group.  The 2018 Budget provides for an allocation of &euro;3 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, 2015 which provides for a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill contains most of the final legislative amendments needed for compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). </p>  <p>  The Government decided in January 2018 to approve priority drafting for a standalone Bill on deprivation of liberty thereby de-coupling these provisions from the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. </p>  <p>  The Equality Division of my Department is currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to progress the remaining committee stage amendments which are mostly technical in nature.

A significant factor in the rising cost of insurance, identified in both the first and second reports of the Working Group (on (i) motor insurance and (ii) employer's liability/public liability respectively), is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. As such, the reports include a number of recommendations relating to insurance fraud.</p>  <p>  An initial roundtable was convened by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of all of the key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud. Additional fraud roundtable sessions have been convened this year to progress a number of specific recommendations contained in the Working Group&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo;, published in January this year. Recommendations 11 and 12 of the report relate to the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has liaised with the Garda authorities in relation to the production of these statistics, and I am informed that the necessary Pulse update is anticipated to be in place by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the same report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 protocol as a starting point.</p>  <p>  In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na produced a draft document which was communicated to Insurance Ireland. The draft document proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made. Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed at the roundtable session of 26 March. It was agreed that further consultations with stakeholders regarding the proposed guidelines would take place, including with insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland; two such consultations have already been held and the next meeting of the Roundtable, scheduled for later this week (29 June 2018), will aim to finalise the new guidelines in the context of the feedback received in these consultations. Agreement on the new set of guidelines is expected to be completed on time in Quarter 3 2018. </p>  <p>  The fraud roundtable process also intends to examine the follow-on procedure in circumstances where fraud or exaggeration is identified in court or acknowledged by a judge. Recommendation 12 of the Working Group&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance&rsquo; proposes that where an application under Section 26 of the Civil Liability Act 2004 is successful, this fact should be communicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Courts Service. I understand that the fraud roundtable is currently engaging with the Courts Service in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that the Department of Finance issues regular quarterly updates on its website in relation to the implementation of the respective reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the latest (fifth) of which was published on 11 May 2018; the quarterly progress update for Quarter 2 will be published next month and will refer to the current status of all the recommendations from both reports. </p></reply>

All three reports are available to view on my Department's website www.justice.ie.  </p><p>The final progress report shows that 133 recommendations have been reported as fully implemented and a further 36 are in progress or partially implemented. This represents a 98% full or partial implementation rate.</p><p>The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years. These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres. As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents are now able to prepare meals of their own choosing.  In addition, there have been improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities and the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p><p>Following on from the McMahon Report, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of McMahon and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State. The Standards will meet the minimum standards set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions: Operational Standards and Indicators and will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process. They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of  employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty. The group is comprised of members from a range of organisations supporting refugees as well as staff from a number of government Departments and will deliver a Working Document in September 2018 following widespread consultation</p><p>The Government approved an opt into the EU (Recast) Reception Conditions Directive (2013/33/EU). The decision to opt-in to the Directive will bring Ireland into line with our EU partners and place the entire system on a legislative basis, which will be subject to EU oversight. This is a significant and positive measure, not only in addressing the issue of labour market access, but also extending to children&rsquo;s rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, vulnerable people, new appeals processes, healthcare and education provision. By opting into the Directive, another important recommendation of the Justice McMahon report will be implemented bringing Ireland into line with the European Union norms.  <b></b></p><p>I remain fully committed to working with all stakeholders, some of whom will have differing views on the extent of implementation of some recommendations, to ensure the continuing implementation of a wide range of reforms in this area, including those recommended by the Justice McMahon report.</p><p><b>Number of people in Direct Provision accommodation as of 22.06.2018 broken down by Nationality and Adult/Child:</b><table><tr><th>Nationality </th><th>Adult</th><th>Child</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>422</td><td>278</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>502</td><td>167</td><td>669</td></tr><tr><td>Zimbabwe</td><td>488</td><td>177</td><td>665</td></tr><tr><td>Albania</td><td>323</td><td>134</td><td>457</td></tr><tr><td>Congo,   The Democratic Republic Of The</td><td>228</td><td>123</td><td>351</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>2003</td><td>668</td><td>2671</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>3966</td><td>1547</td><td>5513</td></tr></table></p><p>The historical information provided in relation to the years 2014 &ndash; 2016 below is taken from the Annual Reports of the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department which are available on their website www.ria.gov.ie under the &lsquo;publications&rsquo; heading.  The 2017 Annual Report of RIA has not been published yet and, therefore, the figures provided for that year have been taken from the monthly report for December 2017 which is also publicly available on the RIA website. </p><p>As described in the published RIA reports, the statistics with regards to numbers and demographics of those in RIA accommodation are primarily drawn from two sources.  The first source is from centre weekly returns, based on a &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; of occupancy each Sunday evening. In other cases, in order to get a demographic breakdown of RIA residents, statistics are produced from the RIA database. As a matter of course, there is usually a slight discrepancy between the numbers sourced by both methods, as the daily numbers &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; in centres, as per the centre returns, has to be processed by RIA staff and subsequently reflected &ldquo;live on system&rdquo; on the database.  </p><p><b></b>At the end of 2017, RIA was accommodating 5,096 persons and 5,344 (3,924 Adults and 1,420 Children) were recorded as live on the database.  The top five nationalities for RIA residents that year were: Pakistan, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Albania.</p><p><b></b>At the end of 2016, RIA was accommodating 4,425 persons and 4,465 (3,334 Adults and 1,131 Children) were recorded as live on the database.  The top five nationalities for RIA residents that year were: Pakistan Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Albania and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p><b></b>At the end of 2015, RIA was accommodating 4,696 persons and 4,885 (3,673 Adults and 1,212 Children) were recorded as live on the database.  The top five nationalities for RIA residents that year were: Pakistan, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.</p><p><b></b>At the end of 2014, RIA was accommodating 4,364 persons, and 4,275 (2,823 Adults and 1,452 Children) were recorded as live on the database.

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration.</p>  <p>  The exercise of powers in this area is subject to the law and respect for individual rights.  In enforcing the law in this respect, Ireland is no different from other countries who also remove individuals who have no lawful right to enter or remain in their territory.</p>  <p>  Over the last four years the number of persons refused permission to enter the State is as follows:</p>  <p>  2017: 3,7462016: 3,9512015: 3,4502014: 2,473</p>  <p>  In general, a person may be refused permission to enter the State on one or more of the twelve grounds set out in Section 4 (3) of the Immigration Act 2004, as amended by the International Protection Act 2015.  Every person refused permission to enter the State is served with a notice in which the reason, or reasons, for refusing an application for permission to enter the State is set out.</p>  <p>  A person refused a permission to enter the State may be removed from the State.  Section 5 of the Immigration Act 2003 (as amended by the International Protection Act 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused permission to enter the State.  It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable.  In the vast majority of cases persons are returned on the next available flight or vessel within a short period of time. Others are granted a temporary permission to enter the State pending removal usually on the condition they report to their nearest Garda station.  Removals are generally operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau, who work closely with officials of my Department in arranging the necessary travel documents and other papers required. </p></reply>

The Government has approved a broad and generous access to the labour market for qualified applicants amongst a number of other important reforms in a range of areas covered by the Directive including reception conditions for applicants, improved identification of vulnerability and children&rsquo;s rights.  These measures are a further step on the road we have pursued in recent years to significantly reform our protection process. </p>  <p>   Under the Directive, asylum seekers will have access to the labour market nine months from the date when their protection application was lodged, if they have yet to receive a first instance recommendation from the International Protection Office, and if they have cooperated with the process. </p>  <p>  Eligible applicants may apply for a labour market permission, which covers both employment and self-employment. The Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS), on my behalf, will process applications. The permission will be granted to eligible applicants for six months and will be renewable until there is a final decision on their protection application. Eligible applicants will have access to almost all sectors of employment.  </p>  <p>  The Directive also includes important provisions in relation to health, education, children&rsquo;s rights, and material reception conditions for applicants, which include housing, food, clothing and a daily expense allowance. These other benefits will apply to all applicants in the protection process regardless of when they made their application.</p>  <p>  The Directive will bring the State into line with standards across the EU Member States for reception conditions for international protection applicants, including standards in accommodation centres. This continues the recent and ongoing positive work carried out to enhance living arrangements for applicants and their families, and to further provide a wide range of supports and services to asylum seekers. Participation in the Directive is another important step in the reform of our international protection and reception systems. </p>  <p>  An information campaign is being launched to ensure that applicants, employers, trade unions, NGOs and all other relevant bodies are fully informed of the labour market access and eligibility arrangements that will apply. Full details and an application form will also be available on the INIS website (www.inis.gov.ie).</p></reply>

The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement </i>as it is referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.

The Working Group, chaired by Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D'Arcy TD, is undertaking a review of the factors which are influencing the increased cost of insurance, and brings together the relevant Departments and Offices involved.  The Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance was published in January 2018 and is available on the website of the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  My Department is the lead in relation to Recommendation 6 of the Report which aims at amending the wording of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to ensure that defendants are notified of a claim having been lodged against them. The intention is not to interfere with the discretion of the courts to deal with cases appropriately but to assist in enhancing the effectiveness of the statutory requirement for a plaintiff to serve a notice in writing on the defendant stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her. </p>  <p>  Among the amendments recommended to be made to section 8 is a reduction from two months to one month in the statutory time period for a plaintiff in a personal injuries action to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer stating the nature of the wrong alleged to have been committed by him or her. In the view of the Working Group, this may be justified by way of being in alignment with data protection legislation which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained. This is relevant for personal injuries cases where CCTV may have captured relevant footage. Generally, the retention period for data protection purposes is one month, beyond which retention is only permitted in certain circumstances, including for example, in the context of an investigation. </p>  <p>  In keeping with the relevant recommendations and timelines of the Working Group the relevant amendments to section 8 are under preparation at my Department so that a suitable legislative vehicle can be availed of for their timely introduction and enactment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-27a.363.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062700075#WRG01600"><p>The issues raised by the Deputy are among those being considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group that was established by the Minister for Finance in July 2016 and is chaired by Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy TD.  The objective of the Working Group is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector.  A significant factor identified by the Working Group in its reports, which are available with action updates on the Department of Finance website, is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. </p>  <p>  In its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance published in January 2017, the Working Group reviewed sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  It noted that the number of recorded prosecutions and convictions for the offence of false evidence in section 25 is very low and that this suggests a need for further co-operation between the insurance industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Working Group noted its understanding that while the majority of the initial applications in respect of fraudulent actions under section 26 were refused it would appear from more recent reported judgments that more claims are now being dismissed following a successful action under section 26.  The Working Group concluded that it is satisfied that sections 25 and 26 do not need further review. </p>  <p>  However, a number of other measures are being taken by way of ensuring that sections 25 and 26 can have their intended effect in relation to insurance fraud. Key to this approach has been the convening of a roundtable by the Department of Finance in late 2017 to listen to the views of key stakeholders in relation to insurance fraud and which has met several times since to progress a number of specific recommendations contained in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report of January 2018 relating to the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance. Recommendations 11 and 12 of that report concern the production of statistics by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service on complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has liaised with the Garda authorities in relation to the production of these statistics, and I am informed that the necessary Pulse update is anticipated to be in place by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the same report recommends that Insurance Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions agree a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. While guidelines were published in 2004, the Working Group noted that these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 iteration as a starting point.</p>  <p>  In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, more fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na produced a draft document which was communicated to Insurance Ireland. The draft document proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made.  Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed at the fraud roundtable session of 26 March. It was agreed that further consultations with stakeholders regarding the proposed guidelines would take place, including with insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland. Two such consultations have already been held and the next meeting of the Roundtable, scheduled for later this week, will aim to finalise the new guidelines in the context of the feedback received.  Agreement on the new set of guidelines is expected to be completed on time in Quarter 3 2018. </p>  <p>  The fraud roundtable process also intends to examine the follow-on procedure in circumstances where fraud or exaggeration is identified in court or acknowledged by a judge.  Recommendation 12 of the Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance proposes that where an application under Section 26 of the Civil Liability Act 2004 is successful, this fact should be communicated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the Courts Service. I understand that the fraud roundtable is currently engaging with the Courts Service in this regard.</p>  <p>  As I think the Deputy will appreciate from these developments, a concerted policy approach is being taken with the support of the Cost of Insurance Working Group to address the issue of insurance fraud.  This is being done by means of a series of mutually reinforcing measures that will include the type of enhanced Garda reporting that the Deputy has raised.  At the same time they are intended, in their collective implementation, to give greater effect to the existing provisions of sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 .</p></reply>

Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further cooperation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017. Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group. The intention would be that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited. As I have previously informed the House, Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities, particularly in the Summer months.</p>  <p>   I am advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators and a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents of anti-social behaviour.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na maintains close contact with local and senior management in Irish Rail and other transport providers. Garda&iacute; also have a good working relationship with the public transport services providers and patrols of uniformed and plain-clothes Garda&iacute;, including personnel on foot patrols and other community engagement duties, are routinely employed when deemed appropriate by Garda management.</p>  <p>   Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and Part 13 of the Act which provide for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>   While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle this problem head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p></reply>

In such instances, the dispute can be referred to the Court for an opinion in the form of a recommendation of the Court. However, in line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland recommendations of the Labour Court are not binding on the parties. It follows therefore that there is no statutory mechanism by which recommendations of the Labour Court made under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2015 can be enforced in law.</p>  <p>  Separately, since 2015 the Labour Court is the single appellate body for complaints arising under employment/equality law.  The procedures for enforcing a determination of the Labour Court in this instance arise as a result of the appeal of a decision of an adjudication officer of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). These procedures are set out at section 45 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p>  <p>  A decision of the Labour Court arising from an appeal of an adjudication officer of the WRC must be implemented within 42 days from the date on which the notice was given to the parties in writing. In circumstances where an employer fails to implement a decision of the Court within the prescribed time periods, an application may be made to the District Court for an order directing the employer to carry out the decision. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, failure to comply with an order of the District Court is a criminal offence under section 51 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.</p></reply>

It will feature high profile buyer networking events and individual itineraries of buyer meetings for participating Enterprise Ireland client companies. Enterprise Ireland has prioritised Enterprise Ireland client activity in Kuwait for 2018, and ran a client networking event in Kuwait in February which coincided with a visit by Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development Ciaran Cannon.</p>  <p>  The Trade Mission in November will be especially relevant to Enterprise Ireland clients in the Agri/Food Tech, Maritime/Logistics, Healthcare, ICT, Fintech, Retail and Professional Services sectors. This trade mission is timed to coincide with the Gulf Food Manufacturing and SeaTrade Exhibitions.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is the state agency under my aegis with responsibility for helping Irish companies to internationalise and scale. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Trade Missions and Events promote the capabilities of client companies to potential business partners and customers in international markets; a central element of the agency&rsquo;s strategy for 2017 -2020: Build Scale, Expand Reach. In 2017 Enterprise Ireland ran 57 Ministerial-led international trade events, including trade missions to Japan, China and Oman. </p>  <p>  On the 12th of March, Enterprise Ireland announced that it is set to undertake over 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of Enterprise Ireland clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets. The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses. 70 of these export focused trade events will be led by Government Ministers.  </p>  <p>  Irish Companies have enjoyed success on previous Trade Missions to the Gulf states including a visit to Oman and UAE in November 2017 where three Irish companies announced deals with Oman partner companies.  On the same Trade Mission, Enterprise Ireland and Atlantic Bridge signed agreements with the Oman Technology Fund to further facilitate market entry in Oman for Enterprise Ireland clients and co-investment opportunities in Irish companies. On the same trade mission, the Dublin-based manufacturer of aviation fabrics and carpets, Botany Weaving, announced that it has secured a multi-million dollar deal with a UAE airline.</p>  <p>  Outside of Trade Missions, Enterprise Ireland covers the Middle East &amp;amp; North Africa markets from its strategic office locations in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, and Doha. The Gulf States represent a significant market opportunity for export-focused Irish companies as a region heavily reliant on imports and with major ambitions for infrastructural development.</p>  <p>  The Gulf region has become a hub for international air travel, connecting Ireland to Asian and African markets and facilitating global expansion for Irish enterprises. A recent economic report commissioned by the Arab-Irish Chamber of Commerce forecasts that Irish exports to the Arab markets have the potential to reach &euro;9 billion over the next two decades.</p></reply>

This includes markets that are growing as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Enterprise 2025 Renewed strategy published in March 2018 sets out targets for export growth and diversification within the indigenous exporting base, with ambitions to increase exports as a percentage of total sales of Irish owned companies from 52 percent to between 55 and 60 percent by 2020 and increase Enterprise Ireland client exports beyond UK markets from &euro;14.1 billion to &euro;17.4 billion by 2020. The strategy also targets a 50 percent increase in the number of FDI investments from non-US markets by 2020.   </p>  <p>  In 2017, Enterprise Ireland launched its Eurozone Strategy as a key element of its supports to help companies diversify their export markets. In particular, it aims to increase exports to the Eurozone by &euro;2bn per annum by 2020, equivalent to 50 percent increase. This would represent one of the most significant shifts in Enterprise Ireland supported client exports into the Eurozone and is particularly important in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, Ireland Connected, supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Enterprise Ireland delivered an impressive programme of international trade events in 2017, giving Irish companies the opportunity to meet with potential buyers and network with key influencers in countries around the world.  In total, 57 internationally focused trade events were organised by Enterprise Ireland in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets, including to date missions to the USA, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Poland and Czech Republic. Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government formally launched the &lsquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rsquo; initiative. Global Ireland will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future. Under the Global Ireland initiative Enterprise Ireland will further increase the diversification of client exports into new markets, with the ambition that 70% of exports will go to markets beyond the UK by 2025.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  In addition, the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year, creating further opportunities across a diverse range of sectors for Irish-based enterprises. In May 2018, the Trade Council of Ministers adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, as wellas adoption of the respective negotiating directives for the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries.  My Department has recently commissioned a study to examine the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation. The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p></reply>

This is particularly important in the context of Brexit and the need to support companies to diversify their product and market bases.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo; supports an extensive programme of Ministerial-led trade missions, as part of a major drive towards market diversification.  Enterprise Ireland delivered 57 internationally focused trade events in 2017 including ministerial-led trade missions to Canada, Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and a major trade programme as part of the State visit to Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <p>  In relation to 2018, the programme of ministerial-led trade missions and events has been finalised and published by Enterprise Ireland, with 70 Ministerial-led trade visits planned to 33 different markets, including to date missions to the USA, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy, Poland and Czech Republic. Missions to EU markets will be a priority focus for the 2018 programme, together with missions to key markets where the EU has or is negotiating free trade agreements.  As part of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &ldquo;Promote Ireland&rdquo; Programmes, Ministerial visits around the world were organised to ensure that we use this exposure to maximise the promotion of Ireland's trade, tourism and investment interests. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government formally launched the &ldquo;Global Ireland &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025&rdquo; initiative, which is the most ambitious renewal and expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s international presence ever undertaken, including the objective of opening at least 26 new diplomatic missions and expansion of our agencies including the overseas networks of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Board Bia. Global Ireland will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future.</p>  <p>  Specifically, Global Ireland 2025 aims to strengthen our presence in the United States, including a new flagship &lsquo;Ireland House&rsquo; &ndash; a hub for diplomacy, trade, business and cultural promotion in Los Angeles, and expanding our presence elsewhere in the Americas. It will also expand our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including a new flagship Ireland House in Tokyo. It also strengthens our presence in North and West Africa, and in the Middle East and Gulf region as well as augmenting diplomatic and agency presence across our main European markets. </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies and embassies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors.  The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more.  These existing EU Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland.  With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth.  In this regard Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The EU&ndash;Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) entered into force provisionally from the 21st September 2017.  Irish companies may now take advantage of the all-important provisions of CETA including the elimination of tariffs on almost all key exports, access to the Canadian procurement market, the easing of regulatory barriers and more transparent rules for market access.  CETA presents new opportunities for Irish business and professionals to work and provide services in Canada.</p>  <p>  On the 21st April 2018, the EU and Mexico reached an agreement in principle on a new trade agreement that will be part of the broader Global Agreement.  The Agreement will provide a platform to increase Irish exports to Mexico, the current total value is just over &euro;2 billion per year with total imports of nearly half a billion euros per year.  It will further remove industrial tariffs and important agricultural tariffs.  This will be significant for Ireland&rsquo;s important Agri-food sector especially for dairy, pork and poultry products.  Ireland is a significant exporter to Mexico of powdered milk and milk derivatives but there are currently significant barriers both to increasing powdered milk exports and to commencing exports of fresh dairy produce.  There are many exciting opportunities in Mexico for Irish businesses including manufacturing, automotive, engineering, telecommunications, ICT, aerospace, software and service and manufacturing technology.  The Agreement will also open up public procurement markets to Irish businesses and remove technical barriers to trade which will reduce the costs of entry to the Mexican market.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing its negotiations with Mercosur and recently announced the successful conclusion of negotiations of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement.  The agri-food sector, in particular will see benefits from access to Japan&rsquo;s highly valuable export market, with improved access for beef, pork, cheese and processed agricultural products.  In addition, the EU&rsquo;s trade deal with Singapore is hoped to come into force by the end of the year, creating further opportunities across a diverse range of sectors for Irish-based enterprises. In May 2018, the Trade Council of Ministers adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, as well as adoption of the respective negotiating directives for the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new FTA&rsquo;s giving Irish firms expanded market access and a predictable trading environment in third countries. Ireland continues to actively articulate its trade interests at EU level at the Trade Council and through collaboration with like-minded Member States, in addition to active participation and representation at the World Trade Organisation. My Department has recently commissioned a study to examine the economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland arising from FTAs, both currently in place and in negotiation. The objective is to deepen our understanding of how Ireland can best take advantage of these opportunities, and ensure that our businesses are prepared to access new markets.</p>  <p>  Finally, I and my colleague Ministers of State in the Department as well as Ministers across Government, avail ourselves of numerous opportunities to meet international Government colleagues, industry groups and individual companies during each year to promote our trade growth, diversification and FDI strategies. </p></reply>

Our goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion, disease prevention and for the structured care of chronic conditions and up-to-date provisions on service quality and standards, performance and accountability. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the HSE met with the Irish Medical Organisation at the beginning of May to set out the State's position in relation to the GMS contract and to progress this important issue.  The Department subsequently wrote to the Irish Medical Organisation to set out the proposals made at that meeting in writing and is currently awaiting the Organisation's official response. </p>  <p>  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in position to give further details while discussions between the parties are under way.</p>  <p>  Reform of the GMS contract will enable general practitioners to better meet the needs of their patients while promoting general practice as a viable and rewarding career for both existing doctors and future medical graduates.</p>  <p>  I look forward to positive and productive engagement with all parties concerned that will facilitate a substantial increase in Government resourcing of general practice on a multi annual basis, contingent of course on agreement to the delivery of much-needed service improvements and contractual reforms.</p></reply>

The process of moving people with a disability from congregated settings into the community, to live more independent lives, is progressing. At the beginning of 2018 there were 2,370 residents remaining in a congregated setting, down from over 4,000 when this process began. In 2017, 144 people moved into the community, while there has been steady progress in the first quarter of 2018. Current projections are that 170 will complete their move to the community this year. </p></reply>

The General Scheme has been developed by officials of my Department, with a view to having this item brought to the Government for consideration in early July 2018. It is hoped that it will be possible to have the Bill referred to the Oireachtas in order for Parliamentary Counsel to commence drafting of the legislation shortly thereafter. </p>  <p>  These provisions to provide for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents will be in addition to the provisions for open disclosure contained in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. The Regulations to prescribe the process for open disclosure in line with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 are also being drafted at present and are expected to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  The Patient Safety Bill, in addition to addressing mandatory open disclosure will also provide for a number of other important patient safety concerns, including in relation to mandatory reporting of serious incidents to an appropriate regulatory body such as HIQA, enabling the Minister for Health to issue guidance in relation to clinical audit, and extending the remit of HIQA to private hospitals.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-27a.503.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062700077#WRJ03900"><p>The successful delivery of the ambitious reform plans envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report will be a significant undertaking and needs to be translated into a detailed and phased programme of work to be delivered over a ten year timeframe. In this regard, my Department is currently finalising an implementation plan in response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report, with a focus on the initial three year period.  It is my intention to bring proposals to Government before the summer recess and to publish the implementation plan shortly thereafter. While I accept that this is later than originally envisaged, it is important that we get it right. </p>  <p>  I have already acted on several of the specific recommendations proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is being established in the Department of Health and a provision of &euro;1 million was made available for the Office in Budget 2018. This office will be tasked with implementing a programme of reform, as agreed by Government, arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. The process for the appointment of an Executive Director to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been managed independently by the Public Appointments Service. This has been a thorough process involving a national and international executive search. An appointment will be made shortly. </p>  <p>  An independent board for the HSE is being established as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The General Scheme of a Bill has been published and it is hoped that legislation will be enacted this year.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Report recommended the removal of private practice from public hospitals. I have established an Independent Review Group to examine how private practice can be removed from public hospitals. It will report later this year.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has recently been completed and responses are being analysed. This will inform work on broader health service structural reform as recommended in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has demonstrated significant commitment to invest in our health and social care services since the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report. Funding for new initiatives in Budget 2018 were closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare. In addition, funding of &euro;10.9 billion has been ear-marked for health projects in the National Development Plan. This will include the development of primary care centres, community diagnostics, community care beds and additional acute hospital capacity, including three elective facilities. </p>  <p>  This is the first time in the history of the State that cross-party consensus of this scale has been achieved on health policy and I welcome this. I intend to harness the consensus generated by the Report to move forward with a significant programme of health reform. The Government is committed to making tangible improvements in our health service and the Sl&aacute;intecare Report provides the direction of travel for this.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the vital role they play in stimulating price competition, and providing an alternative market outlet for farmers.  </p>  <p>  Last year my Department reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal, from &euro;4.80. This gave an important boost to the trade in young calves, and brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle.</p>  <p>  Movement of cattle to Northern Ireland increased by 1, 542 head to over 26, 000 head from 2016 to 2017, while there was a decrease in exports to Great Britain by 724 to 5, 900 head in the same period.  In 2018 to date nearly 8, 600 have been moved to NI, with over 3, 200 moved to GB. </p>  <p>  Movement of cattle between EU Member States is subject to a number of conditions.  Animals must be properly identified, undergo a veterinary inspection, be fit to travel, and be accompanied by an Intra-Community Trade Animal Health Certificate (ITAHC), issued under the EU TRACES system by my Department. Cattle are usually exported from approved assembly centres and must complete a 30-day residency period on a holding (this does not apply to cattle for slaughter) and a TB test prior to export.  </p></reply>

However, illegal racing activities taking place on roads, involving any type of vehicle, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport. </p>  <p>  My Department's interaction with the sulky issue is focussed on animal welfare. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 provides a robust and wide ranging protection for all animals. This includes horses and ponies used in road racing.</p>  <p>  The issue of regulating the use of sulkies has been examined by my Department and the issues are complex and not always clear cut, particularly as there are a variety of horse drawn vehicles legitimately and safely used on Irish roads. </p>  <p>  Therefore the approach being taken by my Department is to raise the awareness of the importance of good horse welfare amongst sulky participants and the owners and keepers of trotting horses.  My Department has recently awarded a tender to operate an education program, that has been designed specifically for sulky drivers and trotter horse owners, in a number of locations around the country. This course will encourage participants to move away from the road racing practices to racing on tracks and to engage with the regulated sport of harness racing on tracks as operated by the Irish Harness Racing Association. </p>  <p>  The course provider has a clear understanding of the cultural sensitivities surrounding participation in road-racing. Meeting these goals will be underpinned by the relevant experience of both the course provider and the team of veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses that will be delivering the course.</p>  <p>  The first round of the course which was undertaken in North Dublin proved very popular with participants.  The next round will be run in north Cork in the coming weeks and in the midlands after that. </p></reply>

Fishing for eel was by way of public licence and therefore the issue of compensation does not arise. However, I directed my officials to engage with the European Commission in relation to Ireland's proposals to fund a support scheme for former eel fishermen. The outcome of that engagement confirmed that funding for the proposed measure is not eligible for support under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. However both Minister Naughten and I have secured Exchequer funding to support the measure and our position that this does not constitute State Aid has been confirmed to the Commission. Consultation with the Revenue Commissioners is at an advanced stage.   Until consultations are completed, it is not possible to elaborate on the terms and conditions for, or the prospective number of participants in, any potential support measure.  Once completed it is intended to publish the relevant details in the coming weeks </p></reply>

However, in general, escapes of farmed fish are recorded and captured in proximity to the escape location. The farmed salmon recorded in the Western river basin district, in August and September 2017, were all recorded in rivers in the Ballinakill and neighbouring Bangor Fishery Districts.  No escaped farmed fish were recorded in rivers to the north and south of this region and it is, therefore, highly likely that the escaped farmed fish originated in the mid-West region.</p>  <p>  The competent authority for the licensing, regulation and development of aquaculture is the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine (DAFM). My Department has no direct role in these issues and questions regarding policy and operational issues around the licensing and regulatory regime for aquaculture are a matter for  that Department. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agency, IFI, are the competent authorities for the protection, conservation, promotion and development of the inland fisheries resource including wild salmon and trout.  In that regard, IFI are the statutory scientific advisors to my Department.</p>  <p>  From a wild fish policy perspective, my Department and IFI have consistently set out our position as regards the development of aquaculture. The policy of the Department and of IFI is to support the development of aquaculture which is environmentally sustainable and which is consistent with domestic, EU and International environmental obligations and requirements in particular the EU Habitats Directive under which wild salmon is included at Annex II.</p>  <p>  When we are consulted on aquaculture proposals, it is this policy that guides our inputs to the Department of Agriculture Food and Marine.</p>  <p>  For my Department and IFI, the provision of advice to ensure the protection of wild salmonid stocks from sea lice infestations emanating from fish farms, particularly in advance of the critical wild juvenile salmon migration season, has always been of paramount importance. Both I and successive Ministers in the Department have consistently expressed the wish to make progress in addressing the issues and in promoting agreement among the diverse stakeholders. </p></reply>

The most recent CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions data shows that in 2016 the at-risk-of-poverty rate was 5.6% for those aged 16 years or over with a principal economic status of &lsquo;at work&rsquo;.  This was a reduction on the 2015 figure of 5.8%.   Eurostat data (calculated on a basis that differs slightly from the CSO measure) suggests that in-work poverty is relatively low here; the Eurostat estimate for Ireland in 2016 is 4.8%, as compared with the EU average of 9.5%.</p>  <p>  Consistent poverty refers to people who are both on relatively low incomes and experiencing deprivation.  The consistent poverty rate in 2016 was 8.3 per cent for the overall population, down from 8.7 per cent in 2015.  Numerically, 395,000 people were in consistent poverty in 2016, based on the 2016 Census population figure of 4.76m.    An analysis of consistent poverty rates by principal economic status shows that the consistent poverty rate was lowest among those who were at work (1.9%).  </p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2016 figures for Ireland.  Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports has continued to fall.  With these improvements, the Government was in a position to introduce a range of welfare increases from 2016 onwards.  Measures include increases in core weekly rates for working-age adults, child benefit, income disregards for lone parents, rent limits for housing support payments and new initiatives to make work pay, such as the Back to Work Family Dividend. </p>  <p>  Income supports play an important role in addressing poverty.  The Working Family Payment (WFP)   (formerly known as Family Income Supplement (FIS)) and Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) are important in-work supports for this group.  WFP is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The BTWFD is a targeted scheme designed to further improve the incentive to take-up employment or self-employment for welfare recipients with children.  In 2016, social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for people of working-age from 33.6% to 16.5%.  This equated to a poverty reduction effect of 50.9%. </p>  <p>  Recent budgets have been forward looking, allocating limited resources in a prudent way, to make sure that everyone benefits from the recovery.  The focus of these budgets has also been on the provision of services rather than simply on income supports (e.g. extension of the School Meals Scheme and the Single Affordable Childcare Scheme).</p>  <p>  The Social Impact Assessment of Budget 2018 show average household incomes increasing by 1.1% (&euro;11.40 per week).  They also provided greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work and almost 25% of the working population experiencing a reduction in their Marginal Effective Tax Rate   with little to no impact predicted for a further 69% of the working population. </p>  <p>  The improvement in the economy, together with the welfare measures referred to, are likely to have supported a reduction in poverty since the period in 2016 to which the SILC publication refers.  This improvement is expected to continue with further rises in incomes and living standards.</p></reply>

Customers of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance will automatically qualify for the TSA.  Approximately 127,000 customers are in receipt of the TSA payment.  The estimated full year cost of the scheme is &euro;16.14 million.  </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people access to personal alarms or phones for security.  The allowance will also encourage social contact and assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.  </p>  <p>  The British UK winter fuel payment is a non means tested payment which is automatically paid to people in receipt of a British state pension.  People in receipt of the British winter fuel payment and the British state pension may apply for fuel allowance.  As with all other recipients of the fuel allowance, the claimant must satisfy a means test as well as all other qualifying conditions.</p>  <p>  People in receipt of the British state pension are not entitled to receive the living alone increase.  The living alone allowance is paid as an increase in the weekly rate of payment to pensioners and people with disabilities in receipt of qualifying payments who live alone. There are no circumstances where the living alone increase is paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department.  This applies equally to individuals in receipt of an occupational or private pension but not a State pension. </p>  <p>  Where a person, in receipt of a UK State pension, has a legal right to reside in Ireland and is habitually resident in this State, and the level of their weekly means are &euro;257.50 or lower, they may claim a State pension (non-contributory) from my Department, effectively as a top-up to their UK pension.  If they qualify for that payment, at any weekly payment rate, and receive a Living Alone Allowance and Fuel Allowance, they will qualify for a TSA payment, on the same basis as someone who paid into the Irish Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at this time to review or extend the criteria for the TSA to allow people who are not in receipt of the living alone increase to receive the payment.  Any decision to do so would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015, the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes. The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.</p>  <p>  A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group was established in 2015 to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model could be identified that would, of itself, be capable of providing and/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis and that would be capable of utilising the available funding.   </p>  <p>  In response to this outcome, it was decided to modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years), which could be used to secure the development of a pilot affordable rental scheme, as envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. Provision was made for &euro;10 million to be allocated to my Department's Vote in 2017.</p>  <p>  Furthermore and taking account of the work and analysis of the Clearing House Group, it was subsequently considered that it would be more constructive to use the existing social housing funding and support mechanisms and, where appropriate, make adjustments to those mechanisms, in order to provide a framework with more realistic prospects of harnessing private investment in an off-balance sheet manner.</p>  <p>  This approach resulted in the design of an alternative delivery mechanism, the Enhanced Long-term Leasing Social Housing Scheme, which was launched on 31 January 2018. Funding is in place to support the delivery of this new scheme and the principal objective of the scheme is to encourage larger levels of private investment in social housing, while ensuring that the resulting leasing arrangement is off-balance sheet in respect of Government expenditure. The scheme is targeted at new build or new-to-the-market properties to be delivered at scale and will complement the existing long-term leasing arrangements, which will continue to be available for leasing existing properties.</p>  <p>  In respect of the commitment to develop an affordable rental model, this is now being progressed through an initial pilot project in Dublin, based on a cost rental model, where local authorities can release the value of their land, and also access funding for enabling  infrastructure, to reduce the construction costs of providing such rental units and facilitate the delivery of the optimal number of affordable homes to rent for low- to moderate-income households, as part of mixed-tenure developments.  Lands held by local authorities, particularly in urban areas where there are high rental costs and significant housing demand, are being identified for cost rental projects, including a large-scale cost rental site in Dublin city, details of which I expect to announce shortly.</p></reply>

The making or amending of such schemes is not a reserved function and does not require the approval of the elected members, however it is subject to the influence of the elected members through the annual estimates process.The Chief Executive of the authority makes the (non-statutory) rent scheme subject to broad principles laid down by my Department in Circular letter HRT 3/2002 dated March 6th 2002.  </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework under section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Such a framework had as its main aim the facilitation of a significant harmonisation in local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a rent framework could mean that the amount of rent payable by some households may be subject to change in some cases. This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.</p>  <p>  I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

It is essential to the overall process that an AHB engages at an early stage with the relevant local authority to discuss demand and general suitability of a proposed scheme/ units. Once the CALF application is submitted to my Department, the relevant local authority will be asked to provide formal comments on the proposal, including on the housing need in the locality, the local authority's intention to exercise their nomination rights, sustainable communities, financial details including market rent, and overall suitability. In this context, local authorities play a key role in the operation of the CALF facility. The Housing Agency will perform a financial appraisal of the application. My Department will then make a decision whether a proposed scheme is suitable for conditional approval for CALF funding.</p>  <p>  To date, my Department has not received an application for funding for the aforementioned project. My Department is aware that an AHB has held discussions with Fingal County Council with regard to this project. However, the progression of the project to funding application stage is a matter between the local authority and the AHB in that context. </p></reply>

Waterways Ireland introduced the current regulatory system in order to provide a mechanism by which the canal navigations would be available for all users in an equitable manner.  </p>  <p>  Since 2012 demand for long term berths has, however, outstripped supply at some locations, with a resultant impact that the infrastructure at these locations is not available to all those who wish to avail of those specific berths.  The current system is also difficult to manage in ensuring that all vessels have appropriate and up-to-date permits.  This is an important aspect of the regulatory system in providing a controlled environment so that our navigations can be open and utilised by all.</p>  <p>  The Grand Canal Basin in Dublin is a much sought after location for long term mooring.  Many vessels have come into the city centre location and have refused to leave. There are 55 berths in the inner basin of Grand Canal Dock.  </p>  <p>  Following a recent review of permitting, Waterways Ireland have decided to allocate 20 berths as Primarily Non-Residential Extended Mooring Permits which will allow owners to berth their vessel in a specified location, but they may stay on-board in Grand Canal Dock for a maximum of 90 nights in a 12 month period.  The remaining 10 moorings have been allocated to visiting vessels who wish to moor in the dock for less than 5 days.  </p>  <p>  In June 2017 all boat owners currently moored in Grand Canal Dock were requested to indicate their preference for a Residential Extended Mooring Permit or a Primarily Non-Residential Extended Mooring Permit.  The demand outweighed the supply for the Residential Extended Mooring Permits and Waterways Ireland applied the criteria noted in Section 3 to allocate these berths.  Those who were unsuccessful in being offered a Residential Extended Mooring Permit were offered Primarily Non-Residential Extended Mooring Permits, if all other criteria were met.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland only has planning permission for 20 houseboat/Residential moorings.  Any permanent residential activity in excess of those 20 berths is in contravention of the 2013 planning approval.  </p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland have been in continuous communication with boat owners in Grand Canal Dock regarding the review and has provided boat owners with ample opportunity to make alternative arrangements should the decision to grant a Residential Extended Mooring Permit or a Primarily Non-Residential Extended Mooring Permit not be acceptable to them. </p></reply>
