In this context, I have secured &euro;2 million extra in Budget 2021 to support up to 50 towns to develop master plans of this nature.

My Department is currently finalising a new five year rural development policy. This policy will recognise that strong rural economies and communities are vital in supporting and safeguarding the sustainability of vibrant towns and villages across the country. </p><p>Significant investment in rural Ireland is taking place across Government and my Department will continue to support communities across rural Ireland through a range of funding schemes and supports. </p><p>Budget 2021 has allocated a total of &euro;341 million to my Department. Much of this funding will support the economic and social development of rural areas under my Department&rsquo;s Rural Development, Regional Affairs and Islands Programme.</p><p>Funding is available for rural areas in my Department through: the &euro;1 billion allocated to the rural regeneration and development fund, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and funding for our Public Libraries.</p><p>Funding is also delivered through the Community Services Programme, LEADER Programme and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme where supports are tailored to the specific needs of individual areas.</p><p>To conclude, I want to acknowledge An Post and the postmasters around the country who have continued to provide vital services to their communities throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and they should be commended for that.</p></reply>

Remote working can help to retain talented people in rural communities, encourage mobile talent to move to the regions, provide increased trade for local businesses, and revitalise our rural towns.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Western Development Commission to develop an integrated network of remote working hubs along the Atlantic Economic Corridor, from Kerry to Donegal.  The WDC has identified and mapped more than 120 remote working hubs which serve that region.  The approach to building this network, with shared back-office services, will serve as a model which can be replicated in other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, 200 Broadband Connection Points will be connected before the end of this year, which will provide communities with free high-speed internet access. Up to 100 more BCPs will be connected in 2021.  Many BCPs have the potential to provide remote working facilities in some of our most remote rural communities.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million was allocated under Budget 2021 for investment in digital hubs through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  Over the last number of years this scheme has supported investment in remote working hubs and BCPs in town centres through applications made by the Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  The additional  funding for 2021 will be used to develop a national network of remote working hubs based on the AEC model, as well as upgrading existing facilities and BCPs throughout the country.  An Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, has been established to progress this project and agree a work programme to ensure that the additional funding is fully utilised in 2021.</p></reply>

CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions and a manager, where warranted.  The CSP co-funding contribution towards employing each FTE is &euro;19,033 per annum and &euro;32,000 per annum for managers.   </p>  <p>  In response to COVID-19 the Department put in place a &euro;1.2m CSP Support Fund for 2020 which provided additional funding to many of these organisations, ensuring that they could pay their full-time CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees.</p>  <p>  In addition, to date, 147 CSP supported organisations have also availed of my Department's COVID-19 Stability Fund resulting in payments of over &euro;6m to these organisations. </p>  <p>  Pobal, who manage the programme on behalf of my Department, have undertaken a detailed review of the financial position of all the CSP supported organisations, as their ability to generate income has been greatly hampered by the Covid-19 crisis in many cases.  The outcome of this review will inform decisions regarding any additional supports that might be required by these organisations. Any additional supports to be provided will be considered in light of available resources.  </p></reply>

The objective of this Transitional Programme is to allow locally-led rural development projects to continue to be delivered using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences.</p>  <p>  The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed. We are therefore planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Transitional Programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, but with the scope to extend this if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament.  </p>  <p>  The total allocation for LEADER next year is &euro;44 million.  This allocation will be used to fund existing projects as they come to completion and submit payment claims. It will also fund new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme, and it will support the administration costs of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as the projects are completed. Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.</p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalized and I hope to be in a position to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme shortly.</p></reply>

The competition has a unique place in Ireland&rsquo;s culture and heritage.  Since its inception in 1958 when it had 52 entrants, the competition has grown year-on-year to see a record number of 924 entrants in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the 2020 SuperValu TidyTowns competition had to be cancelled on public health grounds. At that time, it would not have been possible for Committees around the country to deliver their projects in the usual way.</p>  <p>  However, as we have moved through different stages of living alongside the pandemic, the TidyTowns volunteers have demonstrated that they can continue to do some of their activities while still following all of the necessary public health precautions. My Department has been supporting TidyTowns Groups in that work and has been keeping connected with groups through different communication channels, including a monthly newsletter highlighting their work.</p>  <p>  It is important that we recognise and reward the great work that is happening around the country and the pride of place during these difficult times and that is why I am committed to holding a TidyTowns competition in 2021. </p>  <p>  We may need to alter and adapt our approach to delivering the competition next year given the on-going constraints posed by COVID, but we can still retain the ethos of the competition that has stood the test of time so well.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the format of the competition for next year, having regard to restrictions on gatherings at each of the five levels of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19, and the paramount need to protect the health and wellbeing of volunteers and adjudicators. The details of any changes in the competition will be shared with the TidyTowns groups well in advance.</p></reply>

The new policy will be forward-looking, ambitious, and will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019.  It will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural economies and communities and will identify policy measures for delivery in order to achieve these objectives.  As was the case with the Action Plan, the new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The new policy will recognise that strong rural economies and communities are vital in supporting our national recovery and enhancing our nationwide wellbeing. It will also emphasise the interdependence between urban and rural areas in this regard.</p>  <p>  The process of developing the policy has included a wide range of consultation events with key stakeholders, including Government Departments, State agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people, and the wider public. The insights and views captured through this extensive consultation process have helped to identify the issues that matter to people living and working in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the past months, my Department has held a series of further discussions with key stakeholders to explore the short and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on rural communities and economies and identify actions required to assist rural areas to recover from the impact of COVID-19.  I hosted a public webinar on the topic on 24th September. </p>  <p>  The inputs from these consultations are being factored in to the drafting of the policy and I anticipate that the final policy will be submitted to Government for approval in the near future, prior to its publication.</p></reply>

Remote working can help to retain talented people in rural communities, encourage mobile workers to move to the regions, provide increased trade for local businesses, and revitalise our rural towns.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Western Development Commission to develop an integrated network of remote working hubs along the Atlantic Economic Corridor, from Kerry to Donegal.  The WDC has identified and mapped more than 100 remote working hubs which serve that region.  The approach to building this network, with shared back-office services, will serve as a model which can be replicated in other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  In addition, since 2016 my Department has been working on the Broadband Connection Points (BCP) initiative, which is now rolling out country wide. 200 Broadband Connection Points will be connected before the end of this year, providing communities with free high-speed internet access.  Up to 100 further BCPs will be connected in 2021.  Many BCPs have the potential to provide remote working facilities in some of our most remote rural communities.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million has been allocated under Budget 2021 for investment in digital hubs through my Department's Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  This additional funding will be used to develop a national network of remote working hubs based on the AEC model, as well as upgrading existing facilities and BCPs throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  My Department also invests significantly in remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Libraries programme.</p></reply>

This annual funding of &euro;2.45m supports the ongoing development of the network of all 31 PPNs nationally, as well as the work of the national PPN Advisory Group. The Department will also continue to fund and advance a number of important initiatives to promote and support PPNs&rsquo; development including an online training programme, IT support, and community wellbeing consultations. A new PPN Handbook is currently being finalised and will be circulated to all PPNs shortly. Tenders are also being sought for a structural review of PPNs and the roll-out of a PPN Communications Strategy.</p>  <p>  Following the Covid-19 outbreak, my Department has liaised with all PPNs in relation to their business continuity planning and has provided a range of practical advice on how best to continue their operations and benefit their member groups during this challenging period.   PPNs were also one of the key stakeholders of the Community Call initiative and a review of their experiences has been collated by my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department also has a general oversight and support role with regard to the LCDCs and will continue to fulfil this role in 2021. Supports provided include ongoing financial support to local authorities to support the community function in local authorities including the work of LCDCs. This funding amounts to &euro;1.845 million a year. </p>  <p>  Staff in the Community Policy Unit of my Department engage on an ongoing basis with the LCDC Chief Officers. This includes engagement with a network of regional groupings that meet on a regular basis. Community Policy Unit staff attend these meetings and update the Chief Officers on all aspects of the work of the Department that are relevant to the work of the LCDC. </p>  <p>  Finally, the LCDC Review was published in 2019. My Department continues to progress all objectives and recommendations of the Review to ensure that LCDCs can be supported to address key priorities in the implementation of policy and/or the delivery of services at local level.

The Agri-food sector is Ireland&rsquo;s most important indigenous exporting industry, playing a vital role in the economy, especially in rural and coastal areas.  </p>  <p>  Reducing emissions is a critical element in addressing the global challenge of climate change, but the process of building resilience in the Agriculture sector and adapting to the changes we expect to see in our climate are equally important.  I believe there are opportunities for rural businesses and communities in this process.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is continuing to focus on the sustainable development of the Agriculture sector, while ensuring the maintenance of viable farm incomes.  The role of research and innovation is also becoming more critical to the future of the sector.

Due to delays at EU level, the next EU LEADER programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  The objective of this Transitional Programme is to allow locally-led rural development projects to continue to be delivered using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences. </p>  <p>  The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed. We are therefore planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Transitional Programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, but with the scope to extend this if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament.  </p>  <p>  The total allocation for LEADER next year is &euro;44 million.  This allocation will be used to fund existing projects as they come to completion and submit payment claims. It will also fund new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme, and it will support the administration costs of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years, as projects are completed and submit payment claims.  Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021. </p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalized and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme. </p></reply>

No funding was available for new applications under the programme between 2010 and 2016 due to constraints on the public finances. </p>  <p>  Since the programme was relaunched in 2016, it has supported a range of different measures including outdoor play facilities and support for mobility and cancer care transport. While a small amount of funding under the scheme was used for local access roads in 2016, my Department has since relaunched the Local Improvement Scheme which is providing funding of &euro;10 million in 2020 for non-public roads. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to use CL&Aacute;R funding for road works. Public tertiary roads come under the remit of the Local Authorities.   </p>  <p>  This year, the CL&Aacute;R programme has placed a particular focus on supporting CL&Aacute;R communities to deal with the impact of COVID-19 in their areas. </p>  <p>  On 2nd November, I announced that &euro;4.1 million had been allocated to support 115 projects involving the provision of safety measures around schools and community facilities, as well as the development of community recreation areas. Further announcements will be made shortly in relation to community wellbeing supports under CL&Aacute;R, including for Meals on Wheels and linked services, and Mobility and Cancer Care Transport. </p></reply>

As has been the case in previous years, capital expenditure accelerates towards year end and over a third of our capital spend was profiled for November and December at the start of the year. This acceleration is already evident with capital expenditure of almost &euro;24 million in October, the highest monthly capital expenditure to date. I expect this trend to continue in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  With regard to ensuring the most effective use of the capital allocation, we have been proactive in supporting project delivery in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, for example reducing the  match contribution required for Town and Village projects and tailoring the LEADER claims process to remote working situations. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to closely monitor expenditure patterns, and to stay in close contact with local authorities on the progress of projects and planned spend. I have recently re-allocated &euro;5 million from the &euro;88 million Rural Regeneration and Development allocation to LEADER, due to the level of demand under the LEADER Programme.

In the absence of any such provisions in an employment contract, bereavement leave is normally granted at the discretion of the employer.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, has policy responsibility for maternity leave, parental leave, carer's leave, and force majeure leave.

With the imposition of public health restrictions last March, SOLAS, through its parent Department, requested an amendment to these Regulations to extend the four-year validity period of cards issued from 1 March 2016 as Safe Pass training was unavailable.  </p><p>This amendment provided a derogation to construction workers whose Safe Pass card expired from 1<sup></sup>March 2020 so that they could continue to work.</p><p>When Safe Pass training resumed it was with reduced capacity due to social distancing measures. The derogation ensures that training priority is given to new construction workers and facilitates those unwilling to attend training for medical reasons. The derogation does not negate existing obligations on any employer or worker under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. </p><p>Currently, Safe Pass courses are delivered in a classroom setting although SOLAS is examining on-line options. The availability of on-line training would remove the need for the derogation. My Department is in regular contact with SOLAS, and its Parent Department on the most appropriate timing for the removal of the derogation, which would ideally be linked to an on-line solution becoming available. </p><p>I am not aware of concerns around liability issues for employers due to the extension to the expiry date of certain Safe Pass cards. However, if the Deputy is aware of specific concerns, he can bring these to the attention of my Departmental officials for any necessary follow-up.</p></reply>

This plan will focus on utilising our existing energy and maritime infrastructure and will seek to create the right investment environment and support ocean energy research where necessary in the areas of floating wind, tidal, and wave power.   Commercial floating wind turbines are mostly at the early phase of development but show a lot of promise in the near term. The Atlantic Marine Energy Test site in Belmullet Co. Mayo is being developed by the SEAI in order to test full scale pre-commercial offshore energy technologies. The main focus for the test site since 2018 has been the AFLOWT project which aims to build a full-scale floating wind device to deploy and test. This will demonstrate the investability of floating wind technology and promote its uptake in North West Europe and globally.</p>  <p>  Realising the potential of our offshore resources requires significant work to develop the legal, regulatory and economic regime. The Programme for Government commits to taking the following steps in this regard:</p>  <p>  - Holding the first Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) auction by the end of 2020, with auctions held each year thereafter, including the first RESS auction for offshore wind in 2021;</p>  <p>  - Giving cross-government priority to the drafting of the Marine Planning and Development Bill, so it is enacted within nine months.</p>  <p>  - Producing a whole-of-government plan setting out how we will deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and how we will develop the necessary skills base, supply chains, legislation, and infrastructure to enable it.</p>  <p>  Good progress is already being made on these commitments and my Department is engaged with other Departments and agencies regarding the potential of Ireland&rsquo;s supply chain in this area. The development of our offshore wind sector presents significant opportunities to Irish businesses, communities and the economy as a whole. </p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. </p><p>As of 27 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Carrigaline, Co Cork. In Cork surveys have commenced in the areas of Midelton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfolye, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon, Kilpatrick.</p><p>NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (). </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 23 October, some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at .</p><p>BCPs at Aubane, Mealagh Valley, Glash, Courtbrack, Sherkin Island, Ballindangan, Lissvard Community Centre and Bere Island Heritage Centre are scheduled to be connected in the coming months.  A number of schools in Co Cork including Clogagh and Ballycroneen National Schools will be connected to high speed broadband, for educational access only, as part of the BCP initiative. My Department will work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.</p></reply>

In April of this year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.</p></reply>

Since the publication of that 2018 report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to Continental Europe under close review, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Since early 2019 my Department together with the IMDO has consulted closely with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe.  Shipping companies have assured my Department and the IMDO that they will respond to any increases in demand for direct maritime connectivity when border controls between the EU and the UK are introduced, and shipping companies have been adding capacity on routes to the Continent even during the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-2020. </p><p>The IMDO have very recently completed a review of the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 Landbridge Study and, in particular, the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  The IMDO review confirmed that, at present, there is adequate capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.  The IMDO review will be published shortly.  In addition, my Department in conjunction with the IMDO has recently completed a further round of consultation with shipping companies serving Ireland regarding the issue of direct maritime connectivity at the end of the transition period.  </p><p>Given the spare shipping capacity already available on routes from Ireland, including the additional capacity which commenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, I am confident that the shipping industry will respond quickly to any increase in demand for direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe from January 2021 onwards.  As a result, there is no need for State intervention to secure additional capacity.  Any State intervention to provide direct shipping services in that context would be likely to undermine and disrupt a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place, legal challenges, and breaches of state aid rules with the requirement for repayment of any state aids provided with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any shipping companies receiving such aid.</p><p>My Department, together with the IMDO, Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments and Agencies has recently launched a renewed communications campaign, <b>ACT</b>, which encourages importers and exporters to focus on the direct route option now.  The <b>ACT</b>campaign encourages stakeholders:</p><p>- To <b>Assess</b>their current routes to market;</p><p>- To <b>Communicate</b>their future needs clearly to shipping companies, and</p><p>- To <b>Trial </b>alternative services so that disruption to the UK Landbridge route does not preclude Irish businesses from accessing foreign markets.</p><p>More information on this campaign can be found on the IMDO website here.</p><p>We will continue to closely monitor and keep under review the situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports, and will remain in close consultation with shipping companies, ports, hauliers, and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.</p></reply>

However, I would point out to the Deputy that ADIs are private individuals or companies, who are free to choose whether they will continue to offer their services in the current climate.</p>  <p>  It must be understood that a learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning. The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licenced driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been no decrease in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, despite huge reductions in traffic volumes.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, driving tests were temporarily suspended earlier this year due to the Covid 19 emergency and since resuming operations, there has been an increased level of demand. Unfortunately, due to social distancing requirements, normal capacity is considerably reduced and this means that some customers will experience longer waiting times for a test than was the case before the service was suspended. </p>  <p>  Currently, only those who are frontline healthcare workers and other essential workers are deemed eligible for an urgent test slot, in an effort to accommodate as many as possible.</p>  <p>  Public safety is paramount, and never more so than in the case of our frontline workers, whether through infection or through death or injury on our roads.  For this reason  we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence. </p></reply>

A <i>visitor</i>to Ireland can drive for up to a year on a US licence under the Geneva Convention. </p><p>Irish driver licensing law operates within a framework of EU law.As such, all EU driving licences are exchangeable when a person moves from one Member State to another. In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, Ireland may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange. However, Ireland does not have such an exchange agreement in place with the US.  </p><p>The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has previously explored reaching agreement on exchange with the US. However, US driver licensing operates at state rather than federal level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards, which would have to be studied and compared between each jurisdiction. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined that such an agreement would not be possible.  It may be noted that the road safety data for many US states are significantly worse than any EU state, let alone our record as one of Europe's leaders in road safety.</p><p>When people come to Ireland with a non-exchange licence, there is no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence.  This is a matter of public safety.  While many individuals may consider that they have a safe driving record, there is no way of measuring this. Furthermore, there is no basis on which a driving licence issued by a given authority can be treated differently from another from the same authority. </p><p>While people with a full but non-exchange licence will have to go through the normal driver learning process, they can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and will not have to wait the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.</p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is responsible for the National Driving Licence Service (NDLS).</p>  <p>  The RSA is working with their providers to see how they can create the additional capacity needed as quickly as possible, while adhering to the return to work protocol. Options being introduced include a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime. The NDLS booking system is undergoing software changes to cater for the expanded booking window associated with the additional NDLS appointment slots. The introduction of these steps may help ease some of the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres.</p>  <p>  Anyone can make a case that they are in urgent need of a driving licence can call NDLS customer service at 0761087880 or by emailing info@ndls.ie.  and giving the reasons why they should get an earlier appointment.

Guided by public health advice, measures have been introduced across the system to enable the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and appropriate social distancing measures across the network. New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  </p><p>There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p><p>Since the entire country entered Level 5 of the Government's Living with Covid Plan recently, which has necessitated the capacity on public transport services to reduce to 25%, the NTA  issued a statement on its website on 20th October which says that they will look at &ldquo;<i>particular pressure points</i>&rdquo; in relation to public transport should the need arise, with a view to addressing them at local level.  Dublin Bus, for example, has deployed additional vehicles to address particular problem areas, where possible, to mitigate the impact of capacity pressures on the network.  I would like to thank operators and their staff, particularly drivers, who continue to provide a service in difficult circumstances to ensure essential workers and students can get to work and school.</p><p>Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand, including bus and DART, and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  The NTA advised that the situation on Monday 2nd November, when schools re-opened following the mid-term beak, and also on Tuesday 3rd was much improved with a reduced level of capacity problems notified by transport operators.</p></reply>

Irish driving licence law is based on a framework of EU law, and the current extensions bring us into line with the EU legislation.</p>  <p>  Under Covid19 Level 5 Government restrictions effective from midnight on Wednesday 21 October, for six weeks, applicants can attend an appointment at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) centre provided they are an essential worker involved in the provision of essential services or essential retail outlets. Details on what is included in the list of essential workers and retail outlets is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  A person can apply online to renew a driving licence or learner permit if no supporting documents are required with their application, for example if they are under 70 years of age and do not have a truck or bus category on your licence. They must have verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Services Card (PSC), to make an application online.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is continuing work to expand the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit application types to enable accessibility on-line rather than by calling to an office. The NDLS hopes to allow all application types to apply online by mid-November. </p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance.  While I appreciate the situation is difficult for people, we are bound by the constraints imposed by the Government's Level 5 restrictions, and the need to keep both customers and staff of the NDLS as safe as possible.</p></reply>

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and it has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network.   </p>  <p>  The Government's new "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the new Plan.  The Plan provides guidance for the public about using public transport at the different risk levels;  including that wearing face coverings is mandatory, and encouraging use of off-peak services and sustainable active travel alternative options where feasible.  </p>  <p>  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to having only 25% of their passenger-carrying capacity on vehicles.  Importantly, the continued guidance under the Plan on working from home where possible and the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.  </p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the 2020 public service obligation (PSO) allocation of approx. &euro;300m was utilised to fund the revenue shortfall arising with PSO and Rural Transport operators as a result of COVID-19.  On 4th June 2020 Government agreed an increase in PSO subvention to enable the normal range of Exchequer-supported public transport services to continue to run for this year.  Continuing to fund the existing PSO system will require up to a further c. &euro;460 million to year end (in addition to the c. &euro;300m already provided).</p>  <p>The Government approved temporary funding supports on 26th   June 2020, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months.  The package is restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and is being targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services.  The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering this funding support through contracts established between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p></reply>

The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>Where, as a result of the restrictions, a company or a self-employed individual is either forced to temporarily close their business, or their business is required to operate at significantly reduced levels, they will qualify for support under the scheme.  Certain other conditions will apply, including that the person has a tax clearance certificate.</p><p>Where businesses ordinarily operate from a business premises (generally a building) located in a region for which restrictions are in operation, they may qualify under the scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services due to the specific terms of the Covid restrictions announced by Government. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region that is subject to restrictions, such as a track bookmaker, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria.  A business that does ordinarily operate from a music or entertainment venue (for example, a company that operates a theatre) or a business in the tourism sector carrying on a trade consisting of, for example, the operation of a gallery or other cultural attraction, located in a region subject to restrictions, and who meets the eligibility criteria, will however be able to claim support under CRSS.</p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p><p>It is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity.  </p><p>Companies and self-employed workers who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support live entertainment in 2021, and existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p></reply>

This scheme enables visitors that are resident outside the EU to benefit from VAT relief on goods purchased in Ireland and subsequently taken outside of the EU. If the scheme applies to UK visitors post-Brexit without changes UK visitors will be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses, as purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues. Due to the volume of passenger movements between the UK and Ireland, the volume of refund applications is likely to significantly increase which simultaneously heightens the risk of abuse of the Retail Export Scheme post Brexit.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the measures in the Bill are precautionary and aim both to minimise the potential for abuse of the scheme and to reduce the possibility of diversion in retail consumption from Ireland to the UK, post Brexit. </p>  <p>  The amended legislation proposed in the General Scheme of the Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for two elements to restrict the scheme. The first is a new requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.  The second is to provide that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in value in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The monetary limit will apply in respect of all third country travellers who apply for a refund under the scheme, post commencement of the relevant sections. </p>  <p>  The Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol ensures that there will be no VAT Retail Export Scheme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Any changes to the operation of the scheme will of course be kept under review by Revenue.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p>  <p>  Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming he or she meets various conditions specified in the section, including that he or she is a first-time purchaser and that he or she has completed a tax return form and is tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.  The obligations apply to each party, where there is more than one party to a claim.</p>  <p>  The definition of &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; for the purposes of the scheme is an individual who, at the time of making a claim under the scheme, has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.  The &ldquo;qualifying residence&rdquo; must be occupied as the sole or main residence of the first-time purchaser.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances raised by the Deputy, where a person has previously legally purchased or self-built a home as a &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; and received a HTB refund in respect of that property, but has since relinquished a holding in the property with no financial gain,  he or she will no longer be considered for the HTB scheme given that it is a prerequisite for qualification for the relief that the taxpayer be a first-time purchaser.  </p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs; </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lowerlimbs.  </p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  </p><p>In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p><p>While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p><p>Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. </p></reply>

Eligible employees are defined as those earning weekly gross wages of between &euro;151.50 and &euro;1,462. The EWSS also re- establishes the requirement for employers to operate the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; PAYE system each time they pay their employees and deduct income tax, USC and PRSI. These normal (real-time) deductions were not operated for TWSS or PUP payments, which will be taxed at year end.  </p>  <p>  On 25 September 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, as to how any tax liability arising on the TWSS or PUP will be dealt with. I am pleased to welcome this fair and flexible approach being taken by Revenue and I am confident that Revenue will continue to work with their customers to minimise any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible, noting that because of our progressive income tax system, in the vast majority of cases, the expected tax liability will be modest in scale.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, were matters that were outside the remit of the EWSS.  Essentially, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

However, I believe the incident he is referring to was related to the TARGET2 system. I will answer the question on that basis. </p>  <p>  TARGET2 is the real-time gross settlement system owned and operated by the Eurosystem. Under the Regulation on oversight requirements for systemically important payments systems (SIPS Regulation) the European Central Bank (ECB) is responsible for the oversight of the TARGET2 system.</p>  <p>  Central banks (including the Central Bank of Ireland) and commercial banks can submit payment orders in euro to TARGET2, where they are processed and settled in central bank money, i.e. money held in an account with a central bank.</p>  <p>  As a member of the Eurosystem, the Central Bank of Ireland operates TARGET2.IE for Irish participants. </p>  <p>  On Friday 23 October, an incident adversely affected connectivity to the European TARGET2 system and its participants at 13.40 (Irish Time). Connectivity was restored by the operator at 21.30. Backlogs started clearing after that and late into the night / early morning of 24 October. Regular updates were provided by the ECB via their website. The Central Bank of Ireland maintained contact with Irish participants, as well as officials in my Department, updating them throughout the incident.</p>  <p>  This incident is the third significant incident with TARGET2 in 2020 &ndash; all of which were publicised by the ECB via their website. The other incidents were in August and March and were unrelated to each other. According to initial investigations by the operator into this October incident, it is also an isolated incident, unrelated to the others and the cause in this case was identified as a hardware issue. </p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.    </p>  <p>  If the scheme applies to visitors from Britain post-Brexit and if the UK were to operate a similar scheme for EU visitors, Irish consumers would be able to buy goods VAT free in Britain and visitors from Britain would be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases in both directions, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses; purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues and collecting VAT on goods in excess of personal importation allowances brought into Ireland by consumers would be extremely difficult. The UK has announced its intention to exclude EU visitors from their Retail Export Scheme. It was always my intention to adopt reciprocal measures in Ireland to the greatest extent possible if the UK adopted such restrictions and that remains my position.  These restrictions, in Ireland and Britain, will help avoid tax driven displacement of consumer spending and protect tax revenues. Revenue has also advised that with the volume of travel normally between Britain and Ireland, and the volume of Retail Export Scheme claims that would be likely to arise, there would be significant scope for abuse, with purchases of goods for use in Ireland presented as being for export.  </p>  <p>  The measures contained in the Brexit Bill do not eliminate the use of the VAT Retail Export Scheme for UK residents, post Brexit.  Instead, they provide a legal basis to control and minimise the scope for abuse of the scheme.  The amended legislation provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. I also intend to introduce a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  No study of the kind referred to by the Deputy has been undertaken by my Department or by Revenue, but the risks are clear.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that any development that would weaken our tax base at this time is highly undesirable.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance, I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation. Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis. I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes. The entire financial services landscape has changed significantly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macro-prudential requirements. </p><p>In addition to the developments at European level, we continue to look at how we can improve on the domestic supervisory framework and, in this regard, we have committed in our Programme for Government to introduce a Senior Executive Accountability Regime to deliver heightened accountability within the banking system. </p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</b></p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised in relation to the following recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal:</p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b></p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments. This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements</b></p><p>This recommendation has been considered. These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission. However, if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further.</p><p>However, where in the particular context of multilateral automatic exchange of information arrangements, specific circumstances arise on a case-by-case basis that would warrant Revenue considering requesting permission under those arrangements from the tax authority providing the information concerned to transmit information to another agency, Revenue will do so.</p></reply>

The Act provides for payment of an annual pension equivalent to one eightieth of salary for each year of service capped at forty years&rsquo; service.</p><p>In 1995, the Government decided that full social welfare cover should be extended to all newly appointed civil servants and that they should pay the full Class A social insurance contribution.  The aim of integration with the social insurance system is to prevent &ldquo;double pensioning&rdquo; where both an occupational public service pension and the State Pension Contributory (SCP) would both be payable.  </p><p>The change was introduced under the Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No 77/1995) as amended whereby, with effect from 6 April 1995, all newly recruited civil servants are fully insured and subject to Class A PRSI.  </p><p>The new rules were notified to civil servants under Circular 6/1995 &ndash; Revised Social Insurance Status and Conditions of Service of Certain Civil Servants.  In accordance with paragraph 3 of the Circular, and consistent with the Social Welfare Regulations, the new rules apply to persons appointed to established civil service positions on or after 6 April 1995.  </p><p>Supplementary pensions arise when a bridging payment is required to provide for an individual&rsquo;s overall public service pension entitlement because there can be a shortfall in this benefit in certain circumstances.  Paragraph 18 of the Circular provides for payment of a supplementary pension as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;<i>18. The revised superannuation arrangements include provisions for the payment of a supplementary pension in certain circumstances to pensioners in respect of periods during which the pensioner is not employed in any capacity which involves a social insurance contribution and, due to causes outside his/her own control, fails to qualify for social insurance benefit</i><b><i></i></b><i>or qualifies for such benefit at less than the maximum personal rate. The supplementary pension will be equal to the difference between</i>  	 <blockquote> 	<i>(i)the occupational pension which would have been payable if it had been based on pensionable remuneration instead of net pensionable remuneration and</i><br /><br /><i>(ii)the aggregate of the actual occupational pension payable and the actual rate of social insurance benefit payable (including any payments for dependents).&quot;</i> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The grant of a supplementary pension under paragraph 18 of the Circular is not automatic and is conditional upon a number conditions as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	1.The individual must have reached minimum pension age in accordance with the rules of his/her pension scheme; <br /><br />2.The individual must not be engaged in paid employment;<br /><br />3.He or she does not qualify for social insurance benefit or fails to qualify for such benefit at the maximum rate; and <br /><br />4.His or her failure to qualify must be due to causes outside his or her control.   </blockquote>  <p>The arrangements for the payment of supplementary pensions has always existed for fully insured civil servants. Similar rules for integrated pension schemes also apply across the wider public service e.g. in the education sector.</p></reply>

The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders.It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.  </p><p>Earlier in the autumn, a project called the  Music Industry Stimulus Package was managed on behalf of my Department by First Music Contact.  The Package was targeted at professional musicians and their teams to support song-writing camps, recording and album releases.

The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. The Reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:  .</p><p>While my Department does not collate the data requested by the Deputy I am acutely aware of the tragic deaths in recent days and months of individuals who have been accessing homeless services. I offer my sincere condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives. While every situation is unique, at an overall level, it is vital we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit homelessness into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are supported.</p><p>The latest quarterly report shows that 1,350 adults and their dependants exited homelessness into tenancies in the third quarter of 2020, with 1,485 having exited in quarter two.  In the year to date, a total of 4,401 exits from homelessness have been achieved.  </p><p>These quarterly exit figures can be viewed in the broader context of overall homeless numbers. The numbers accessing homeless accommodation have reduced considerably in recent times.  At the end of quarter three 2020 there were 8,656 individuals accessing emergency accommodation, a reduction of 43 individuals on the previous quarter, and a decrease of 1,741 individuals (16.7%) on the 10,397 total recorded at end of quarter three 2019.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to reducing and preventing homelessness and since becoming Minister I have secured significant additional resources. Budget 2021 makes provision for &euro;218m in funding for homeless services next year.  The original budget allocation for 2020 was &euro;166m with a further &euro;30m already secured in July of this year.</p><p>The increased funding will allow for a greater focus on preventing homelessness in the first instance while also ensuring that pathways out of homelessness for those individuals and families in emergency accommodation are secured as quickly as possible.  This reflects the priority that I as Minister and this Government is rightly giving to homelessness.</p><p>For those experiencing homelessness the additional funding will support the provision of additional outreach services for rough sleepers and the expansion of Housing First targets, which is a commitment in the Programme for Government. Housing First provides homes for rough sleepers and long-term users of homeless accommodation and provides them with the wrap around housing and health supports that they require to sustain a tenancy.</p></reply>

In the case of wind farm development proposals comprising not more than 25 turbines or having a total output not greater than 50 megawatts, planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority, with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Wind farm development proposals in excess of these thresholds are classified as Strategic Infrastructure Developments under the Seventh Schedule of the Act in respect of which more streamlined arrangements apply and where such planning applications are required to be made directly to the Board. Wind farm development proposals can be quite complex in nature, having to comply with relevant EU environmental and habitats related reqiurements, resulting in some delays in the determination of such planning applications and appeals by the Board. However, concerted efforts are made by the Board to prioritise wind farm cases so that determinations are made in as timely a manner as possible in the circumstances.</p>  <p>  Offshore windfarms are not provided for under the terrestrial planning regime and are instead currently legislated for under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended. In this regard, my Department is leading the development of a new Marine Planning and Development Management (MPDM) Bill which will provide the legislative basis for Ireland's new marine planning regime including offshore wind farm developments. The MPDM Bill is somewhat modelled on the terrestrial planning regime while also having regard to relevant EU and UN requirements in relation to marine developments and the marine area.  </p>  <p>  In order to deal with offshore renewable energy (ORE) developments in respect of which planning applications have been submitted under the pre-existing Foreshore Act provisions but which have not yet been determined, a transition protocol has been developed in association with the Department of Environment, Communications and Climate to enable the transfer of such development proposals to the new regime being developed under the MPDM Bill. Once the MPDM Bill is enacted, my Department will develop planning guidelines for ORE with the aim of supporting ORE development.</p></reply>

Objective 29 of the NPF &ldquo;supports the implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks&rdquo;.</p><p>Separately, the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, sets out mandatory objectives for local authorities, which must be addressed in the drafting of their County Development Plan governing local development policies.  Section 10(2) of the Planning and Development Act includes a requirement that, where there is a Gaeltacht area within the planning authority&rsquo;s territory, the development plan must include provisions and objectives for &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo;.</p><p>To provide further guidance in preparing appropriate policies, my Department produced &lsquo;<i>Development Plans, Guidelines for Planning Authorities</i>&rsquo;, to address this mandatory objective of the Planning and Development Act. These guidelines refer to linguistic and cultural heritage and the needs of the community in land-use terms for housing, community facilities, employment, tourism and design, including advertising and signage.</p><p>Individual development plans may also oblige applicants for planning permission to submit certain particulars or information to accompany development proposals in Gaeltacht areas, such as assessments of the linguistic impact of the proposed development, in order for it to be assessed against relevant policies of the development plan.</p><p>Since April 2019, the assessment of all local authority development plans and local area plans is undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR). The oversight role of the OPR includes ensuring consistency with relevant national or regional policies, including those set out in the NPF and addressing all relevant mandatory objectives for County Development Plans set out in the Planning and Development Act, including the provision of Gaeltacht-specific objectives, where required.</p><p>This statutory functions of the OPR may ultimately include a recommendation to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to direct a planning authority to amend or revoke a statutory plan, under procedures set out in Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Such circumstances include where local authorities fail to adopt policies that reflect the overall national policy position or are in breach of the statutory requirements under Section 10 of the Act.</p><p>With respect to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may be concerned, i.e. consideration of any planning application, I am subject to limitation in exercising any power or control, which includes commenting or making statements, under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. This includes the competence, or otherwise, of individuals to prepare relevant documentation or plans as part of a planning process.</p><p>However, I can generally advise that a planning authority must notify the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (currently the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts , Gaeltacht, Sports and Media) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, to invite their views in relation to planning applications for developments which, in the opinion of the authority &ldquo;might materially affect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo; in accordance with Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended).</p><p>The decision to grant or refuse planning permission in such cases, and to assign conditions, including conditions relating to language where appropriate, to a grant of planning permission, is ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This includes development proposals such as housing estates or holiday homes. I am confident that the local authorities are fully aware of their responsibilities in relation to assigning conditions to a grant of planning permission and I do not intend to issue a circular at this time.</p><p>I am of the view that considering the unique spatial and linguistic circumstances relating to each of our Gaeltacht areas, with local variation between communities and the contexts in which the Irish Language is spoken, that the relevant planning authorities are best placed to implement the framework of legislation, policy and guidance as set out above.  I am also satisfied that there are appropriate planning oversight mechanisms and safeguards in place, which include the Office of the Planning Regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p><p>However, a number of Irish language groups, including Conradh na Gaeilge, have raised these matters with me and I have undertaken to meet with Conradh na Gaeilge this week to discuss this more generally.</p></reply>

In very broad terms, the Morairty Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported. </p>  <p>  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 (the "2012 Act"), which was enacted on 28 July 2012, significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland.  These were issues that were central to the recommendations made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.  Ultimately, the 2012 Act comprehensively addressed these core issues while also having regard to Government commitments at that time as well as recommendations from the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption (GRECO) and the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) on other related matters.</p>  <p>  The Tribunal recommended that all political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported and published.  Under the 2012 Act, which amended the Electoral Act 1997 (and the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999), the threshold at which donations must be declared by a political party to SIPO fell from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500.  The declaration threshold for a donation received by a candidate or an elected representative was reduced from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600.  In addition, a limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.</p>  <p>  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was also reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned under the 2012 Act.  There was a reduction from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;200 in the threshold at which donations must be reported by companies, trade unions, societies and building societies in their annual reports or returns.  In addition, the threshold for donors other than companies, trade unions, societies and building societies, in reporting donations to SIPO was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500 for aggregate donations given in the same year.</p>  <p>  The Moriarty Tribunal in its Report also noted that the desirability and feasibility of a complete ban on private political funding is pre-eminently a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas and for public debate and consideration, having regard to constitutional issues that might arise, and to the national financial exigencies.  With reference to this comment in the Tribunal Report, a noteworthy provision in the Act is the introduction of a ban on the acceptance of donations over &euro;200 for political purposes from a corporate donor unless the donor has registered with SIPO.  In this instance, the objective was to restrict the influence of corporate donors.  Such donations also need to be accompanied by a statement confirming that the donation has been approved by a general meeting of the members of the body corporate, or by its trustees.  By restricting corporate donations in this manner, the 2012 Act went beyond the recommendations made by the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  The 2012 Act provides for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be accepted as a political donation by an individual from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  This &euro;1,000 limit applies in respect of donations to a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament or a member of a local authority, as well as a candidate at a Presidential, D&aacute;il, Seanad, European Parliament or local election.  The maximum amount that can be accepted as a donation by a political party, an accounting unit of a political party or a third party has been reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500.</p>  <p>  In addition, the 2012 Act provides that political parties are required to submit audited annual accounts to SIPO for publication.  These requirements first applied for the year 2015.  This requirement also goes beyond the Moriarty Tribunal recommendation by providing that both the income and expenditure of political parties is reported, audited and open to public scrutiny.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

All EU Member States are parties to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, which sets out the core principle of non-refoulement. In addition, the principle of non-refoulement is enshrined in EU law, under the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. As such, all EU countries are bound by the principle of non-refoulement. </p>  <p>  The EU regularly makes its position on non-refoulement clear, and reminds other States of their obligations. At the most recent meeting of UNHCR's Executive Committee in October, the EU delivered a statement that "the EU and its Member States recognise the importance to safeguard the right to seek asylum and the principle of non-refoulement, as enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights." </p>  <p>  The EU recognises the generosity of Lebanon in hosting over 1 million Syrian refugees, despite facing its own challenges including an economic crisis and COVID-19. The EU has consistently provided support to Lebanon's efforts, including over &euro;660 million in humanitarian assistance since 2011. </p>  <p>  On a national basis, Ireland's response to the Syria crisis has been its largest single response to any humanitarian emergency. Ireland has provided over &euro;168 million in humanitarian assistance since the start of the crisis, including over &euro;30 million in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon. </p></reply>

The enhanced methodology also recognises the need for more decisive measures proportionally sanctioning any serious or prolonged stagnation or even backsliding in reform implementation.</p>  <p>  The European Commission published its Annual Enlargement Package and country reports in October 2020. In terms of the progress of individual Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro are both currently negotiating Chapters of the Acquis with the EU. Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The country reports for 2020 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made limited progress. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms in areas such as governance, rule of law and media freedom and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, while Montenegro must address shortcomings in the areas of media freedom, fight against corruption and trafficking, and turn its attention to the closing of Chapters.</p>  <p>  Regarding North Macedonia and Albania, it was agreed by the European Council in March 2020 to open negotiations with both countries. The draft negotiating frameworks are currently being discussed by Member States. Once these are agreed, we can proceed to the first Intergovernmental Conference which will mark the formal start of accession negotiations. Ireland warmly welcomes the opening of accession negotiations with both countries and looks forward to the first Intergovernmental Conferences taking place at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Bosnia-Herzegovina has made limited progress over the last year and faces significant challenges to ensure implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s 2019 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform. Progress in these areas must be seen before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered.</p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2020 noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path. It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country.</p>  <p>  Turkey remains a key partner but continues to move further away from the EU. Accession negotiations will not begin again until Turkey reverses course on its backsliding on the rule of law and fundamental rights. However, the EU&rsquo;s continuing engagement with Turkey in the accession context remains in the interests of the Turkish people and we must build a more constructive EU-Turkey relationship.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the enlargement process and accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

Our Embassy in New Delhi has been engaged on the matter including with the EU Delegation. The EU Delegation has contacted the National Human Rights Commission of India to enquire about the conditions of the detention of this human rights defender, and raised the possibility of his release on humanitarian grounds given his age and the risks posed by COVID-19 in prison. Regrettably, an application for bail on health grounds was rejected by a court on 23 October based on the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.</p><p>The Embassy will continue to monitor developments in this case. We expect the authorities in India to have due regard for his health and well-being during his detention and to fully respect the rule of law including the presumption of innocence.  </p></reply>

The RFI specifically requested that interested suppliers confirm that all products comply with Regulation (EU) No. 528/2012, commonly known as the Biocidal Products Regulation, and with the European Union (Biocidal Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 427/2013); and to confirm that all products comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/425 of 9 March 2016 on personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  On 22 October 2020 the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine notified my Department that it had removed ViraPro hand sanitiser from the product register. On the same day my Department removed the supplier of Virapro and its entire product offering from the procurement agreement and advised all schools to cease all use of these products. These products have been on general sale and not just available through the education sector framework.</p>  <p> On Friday 23rd   the Department of Agriculture advised not to use any Virapro branded product and this was communicated to schools. My Department immediately commenced a review of biocidal products included in the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement.  </p>  <p>   This involved reviewing 172 items from 14 suppliers.  The outcome of this review was a decision to take 43 biocidal and 9 other products off the approved list for schools because it has not been possible to satisfactorily confirm their registration status as part of this review. These products will not be included in my Department&rsquo;s approved list for schools until their registration status has been confirmed. The Department has no evidence that these products are unsafe. </p>  <p>  The review was undertaken in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine Testing, which is responsible for the testing, approval and certification of all biocidal products for sale in the State and to which I would refer the Deputy for further information. </p>  <p>   Immediately following the product review my Department on Thursday 29 October, 2020 wrote to all schools to advise them of changes to the approved list of products on the Education Sector PPE procurement agreement, and the steps they can take to procure new stock if they need to. Suppliers on the agreement committed to swift processing of orders and delivery to support schools, and the Department has not been made aware of any shortages of note in PPE supplies in the system.</p>  <p>  My Department has added a new supplier to the PPE Agreement, this supplier had engaged in the original process and they have now completed the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine biocidal registration process. 23 new products were added to the agreement from the 14 suppliers on the agreement.    </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has commenced reference sample testing for other products other than ViraPro. To-date they have analysed reference samples relating to 39 products on the Education Sectors current framework of hand sanitisers. Laboratory analysis confirms that these products are in accordance with their respective conditions of registration. In addition, one unregistered product has been analysed. No issues in relation to safety or efficacy have been identified. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is continuing to increase its testing of product on the market to provide reassurance in relation to compliance with approved product specifications.</p>  <p>   My Department is currently reviewing overall PPE supply requirements for the sector to determine the optimum supply arrangements for the future designed to maximise opportunities for supplier participation.</p></reply>

The criteria for the award of Incremental Credit, for previous teaching experience, to recognised post-primary teachers is outlined in Circular 29/2007 and 10/2001 for primary teachers, and was agreed in the first instance, by the Teacher Conciliation Council (TCC). This Council is comprised of representatives of the teacher unions, school management bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  Currently, a maximum of seven years incremental credit may be awarded for approved teaching service, given in approved schools outside the European Union, as per Circulars 10/2001 and 29/2007.</p></reply>

Among the supports provided is the extension of the Substitute Teacher Supply Panel.  </p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with our Partners on expanding teacher supply panels.  The base schools were first identified in collaboration with the INTO and Primary Management Bodies.  The INTO and Primary Management Bodies made contact with these schools with a view to being a base for that location.</p>  <p>  In forming the Supply Panel Clusters, the Department&rsquo;s Geographical Information System (GIS) identified the receiving schools based on distance from the base school.  The Supply Panel Teaching posts were allocated to each Supply Panel based on the number of schools in the cluster and the number of permanent teaching positions to be serviced by the scheme.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 115 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 330 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to almost 2,300 schools across the country.  In relation to Co. Wicklow, there are 5 Supply Panels in the county operating in over 90 schools.</p>  <p>  These substitute Supply Panels are not the sole means whereby schools source substitutes but are set up to work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers whether through a school&rsquo;s own panel of regular substitutes or the National Substitution portal service as outlined in the Department Circular 45/2020.</p></reply>

Therefore, all applications for capital funding must be considered in this context.</p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in schools.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that a devolved grant was approved in November 2017, under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme, to enable the school authority to provide 1 additional SET room.  This project is currently devolved to the school authority.</p>  <p>  A further application has recently been received under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme and once the application has been assessed, the school authority will be contacted directly with a decision.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Children who apply for transport and who are not eligible under the terms of the scheme are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  </p>  <p>  Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.  Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann determines the allocation of the tickets and refunds payments made on behalf of those concessionary applicants for whom no seats remain. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that the children to whom the Deputy refers are not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their nearest post primary school. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received by the family in question on 10th September 2020 and as such is late and that the service was at capacity when payment was received.</p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.  The COVID Tracker App assists public health teams as part of their Public Health Risk Assessments.  The COVID Tracker App is intended to augment manual contact tracing processes rather than replace them. The app has a number of advantages. People who have been on close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19 are normally notified faster by the app, than is possible via the manual contact tracing process. The app can also alert people who are strangers to the Covid patient and who otherwise could not be traced via manual contact tracing processes.</p><p>In the version of the app released on 27<sup>th</sup>October 2020, a &lsquo;PAUSE&rsquo; function was introduced for health care workers to allow them to temporarily disable proximity detection when wearing PPE. The same &lsquo;PAUSE&rsquo; functionality is already deployed successfully in the Northern Ireland and Scottish Covid tracker apps.  The information provided in the App when a close contact alert is received has been updated and includes guidance for people in schools and healthcare settings.  It now also includes the date when the close contact happened. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed, that the child to whom the Deputy refers, is eligible for School Transport. However, payment for School Transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received on 8th September 2020 and as such is a late payment and no ticket has issued for transport for the current school year. </p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. In addition, payments or submission of medical card details for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route. </p>  <p>  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

While there has been a reduction in mainstream class size in recent years, there has not been a corresponding reduction for those Urban Band 1 DEIS schools who are already allocated a preferential staffing schedule of 20:1 for schools catering for junior classes only and 24:1 for schools catering for senior classes only. Most DEIS Urban Band 1 schools operate vertical  schools with a ratio of 22:1.</p>  <p>  As an initial step in addressing this, I have focused on a reduction in the Senior DEIS Urban Band 1 primary schools and therefore there will be a one point reduction in their staffing schedule from 24:1 to 23:1.   </p>  <p>  The total budget allocation of additional funding of &euro;2million in 2021, with a full year allocation of &euro;5million in 2022 provides  for further supports to be allocated as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage.

Consequently, there are as of November 1<sup>st</sup>over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p><p>During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. </p><p>My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).  </p><p>Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before the end of the year . </p><p>I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees of similar schemes in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing training and development opportunities to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>  The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are in ongoing communication on the matter. </p>  <p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.</p></reply>

The maximum number of participants that can attend a Safe Pass course was reduced from twenty to ten participants in line with SOLAS&rsquo; Standard Operational Pandemic Containment Guidelines to allow for the re-opening of the sector. There is also a &euro;32 fee payable to SOLAS for the processing, manufacturing and distribution of Safe Pass cards which is unchanged and is generally included in the overall price for attending a course.</p><p>The continued delivery of certification schemes to support health and safety in the construction sector during the Covid-19 period is vital and SOLAS is actively examining alternative delivery methods for all applicants to identify a solution that is equitable with existing Safe Pass, CSCS and QSCS course delivery, in being accessible to all eligible workers, providing real time course participant supports and ensuring assessment integrity. </p></reply>

In a strengthening labour market, higher educational attainment levels have been linked with higher employment rates. </p><p>As outlined in the report, persons aged 25-64 with a third level qualification were more than twice as likely to be in employment (86%) when compared to those with no formal education/primary education (40%). Similarly, those with no formal or primary education were twice as likely to be unemployed (6%) when compared to those with a third-level qualification (3%).</p><p>The findings of  this survey conducted with 2018 graduates nine months after graduating, show that for honours degree graduates from County Donegal,</p><p><b>- 77% </b>were working or due to start a job (<i>compared to 75% for all honours degree graduates</i>)</p><p><b>- 15% </b>were engaged in further study or training (<i>compared to 19% for all honours degree graduates</i>)</p><p><b>- 7%</b>were unemployed and looking for work (<i>compared to 4% for all honours degree graduates</i>) and;</p><p><b>- 1%</b>were engaged in other activities (<i>compared to 3% for all honours degree graduates</i>)</p><p>The development and progression of technological universities (TUs), including a TU in the Connacht Ulster region, is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s higher education policy as underscored in the Programme for Government 2020. In this context the Government&rsquo;s objective for the establishment of a university serving the north-west is being advanced through the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA) TU development consortium composed of Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Galway Mayo IT and IT Sligo.  CUA is working on plans to submit an application seeking an order for establishment as a technological university under the Technological Universities Act 2018. My Department understands that an application is to be submitted by CUA by the end of this year. The consortium has to date received &euro;11.6 million to date, including &euro;5.7 million under the new TU Transformation Fund allocations which I announced on 7 October, in Exchequer funding administered by the Higher Education Authority to assist in its TU development proposals.</p><p>Technological universities have a particular emphasis on regional development, research and technological skills. However, they are multi-faceted and deliver a range of disciplines and levels of qualifications including apprenticeship to meet regional and national skills needs. TUs also concentrate on teaching and learning excellence, lifelong learning and have a student centred focus at their heart.  TUs aim to become catalysts for enterprise and regional development and to increase the profile of this form of Irish Higher Education Institute (HEI) nationally and internationally. The development of a TU serving the North West would be of major significance and impact to higher education and regional development in the region.</p><p>In 2020 as part of the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 3 Innovation and Agility the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA) institutions of Galway Mayo IT, Letterkenny IT and IT Sligo were awarded &euro;12.4m to progress a project entitled &ldquo;Enabling Agile Responsiveness from Higher Education&rdquo;.  This project presents a vision for the future of higher education agility, development, delivery and assessment. It will provide highly flexible access to quality higher education through new technology enabled models. </p><p>The project consists of a set of inter-linked innovations underpinned by a series of demonstration sub-projects to:</p><p>1. build and prove lean systems necessary to respond rapidly and effectively to training and education needs of employers and individuals;</p><p>2. cost-effectively develop new flexible modes of Higher Education (HE) to engage younger and lifelong learners.</p><p>The outcomes of this project over the 5 year period seek to enhance the quality of and provide a closer link between enterprise in the regions and the higher education system.</p><p>In 2020 approximately 20 Springboard+ and Human Capital Initiative courses were approved for Letterkenny IT.  These courses are designed in collaboration with regional enterprise to provide opportunities in key skill need areas of the economy for those in employment and those seeking employment. </p><p>During the current Covid-19 crisis, the Regional Skills Fora Managers, including in the North West, have been working remotely acting as a first point of contact and co-ordination point for enterprise in relation to the Covid-19 supports available to businesses and employees. The Fora have also continued to meet and alert further and higher education providers to immediate enterprise requirements in their regions.</p><p>My Department will continue working with all stakeholders to address current skills needs and looking beyond the current world of work to prepare students to succeed in the existing and future labour market and avail of future job opportunities.</p></reply>

This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the change in circumstances provision, the income of all parties to the application can be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. SUSI also requires confirmation that the change is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant. The applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie.</p>  <p>   Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

All operational decisions taken during this time are in line with Government and public health advice. </p>  <p>  There was a temporary suspension on the acceptance of some visa application, including join-family applications, introduced in March 2020. The Immigration Service continued to process those join-family applications which it had received before the suspension was introduced. The suspension on the acceptance of join-family applications was removed in June 2020, and join-family visa applications continue to be accepted and processed. It remains the position that we are not accepting most short stay (fewer than 90 days) visa applications. Details of the other visas which are being processed are available on our website: www.inis.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  There are still restrictions in place in some countries which are outside our control and the Immigration Service intends to resume accepting join-family visa applications as soon the local conditions permit in those countries. The extent of the resumption of visa services will continue to be decided in accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) and Health Service Executive (HSE) guidelines both in Ireland and globally.  </p>  <p>  The Immigration Service has implemented a suite of measures to help in reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus including the implementation of remote working for staff in order to comply with social and physical distancing measures. Unfortunately, these measures have led to a reduction in processing capacity. While delays are expected including in the processing of join-family visa applications, we are endeavouring to processing such applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result of these factors.  </p></reply>

Over 80% of these applications were received in the preceding 24 months.  Older cases are complex in nature, may be subject to judicial review and/or continue to be active for a range of reasons. </p>  <p>  In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks, including security checks can take a considerable period of time with the result in some applications taking longer than the average timescale. </p>  <p>  Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  Additionally a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 12 months.  A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays last year. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 restrictions which have impacted the delivery of normal services to date this year. The combined impact of the Jones judgement and the COVID-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.</p>  <p>  My Department is working on various solutions to process the existing caseload on hand, including the enhanced website which provides perspective applicants with greater information than before, the roll-out earlier this year of the e-payments facility, along with a range of other ICT solutions which are been progressed. Moving to e-tax clearance and e-Vetting will also support speedier processing going forward.  The situation continues to be monitored in order to improve service to our customers.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 has unfortunately prevented the holding of our large scale citizenship ceremonies which is impacting the processing of applications. I have recently given approval for the priority drafting of a statutory instrument covering applicants who are 'ceremony ready' where my Department will issue the naturalisation certificate on receipt of a statutory declaration. In this way, we hope to alleviate the delays currently impacting those seeking to start their new lives as Irish citizens. This will enable approximately 3,000 applicants to be granted citizenship in the near future. It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow.  </p></reply>

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demands.  This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; over the last eight months as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>I have been advised by the Garda authorities the table below sets out the number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to Swords Garda Station in the years in question. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Sergeant</th>       <th>Garda</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Insofar as the current year is concerned, I am further advised that Garda Members attached to Swords Community Policing Unit were temporarily re-assigned to the Regular units at the commencement of the new roster introduced as part of the response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Covid-19. I am assured by the Garda authorities that members from the Community Policing Unit remain in contact with their contacts throughout the community, and have been providing valuable assistance to vulnerable persons throughout the crisis. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Swords is located in the DMR North Garda Division, and forms part of the Coolock District.

Insofar as my Department is concerned, I can advise the Deputy that since the Tribunal produced its findings, there have been a number of significant steps taken to strengthen the State&rsquo;s ability to tackle corruption and related activities.  </p><p>In particular, I would refer the Deputy to the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 which is a very important piece of legislation in the fight against corruption both in Ireland and abroad. The Act represents a complete overhaul of anti-corruption offences in Ireland, which dated as far back as 1889 and were contained in seven different statutes. </p><p>The Act provides a single, consolidated modern piece of legislation which is more comprehensive and more accessible. As well as being a consolidation, the Act is also responding to recommendations from the Mahon Tribunal, from GRECO, from the OECD Working Group on Bribery and from the UNCAC Implementation Review Mechanism. Some of the key aspects of the Act include the introduction of new offences and tougher penalties in areas relating to the giving of gifts; trading in influence; false documentation; and a liability offence for bodies corporate where any individual connected with the company has been found guilty of corruption. Further information relating to the Act and the Government&rsquo;s cross-Departmental approach to tackling corruption and bribery can be found on www.anticorruption.ie. </p><p>The new Programme for Government,<i>Our Shared Future</i>, recognises the reputational and economic damage that corruption and white collar crime can cause to the State and commits the Government to introduce and implement new anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures informed by the work of the Review Group on structures and strategies to combat corruption and fraud (Hamilton Review Group) with a focus on legislative, structural and resourcing measures to enhance agency and multi-agency enforcement and prevention capacity in the criminal justice sphere. </p><p>The Hamilton Review Group was established as part of a package of measures to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s ability to combat economic crime and corruption. Its membership comprised representation from Government Departments and the key State agencies with responsibility for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic crime and corruption as well as a small number of experts from outside the public service.  </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that I intend to publish the Report of the Hamilton Review Group in the near future.</p></reply>

LCR encourages people to join the health insurance market at a younger age to avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older. The objective of LCR is to ensure sufficient balance between older and younger people, between those who tend to claim more and those who tend to claim less, with the aim of ensuring sustainability of the community-rated market overall.   </p>  <p>  A person who lived outside the State on 1 May 2015 and moves to Ireland has 9 months (from the date of moving) to purchase inpatient private health insurance without incurring any LCR loadings. In circumstances where loadings do apply, previous periods of inpatient cover are taken into account and can reduce the level of loading applied to a premium. Any loading will apply for a maximum period of 10 years.</p></reply>

The plan sets out five levels of response, each with several measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. </p><p>Prevention and suppression of the disease in the community is the critical first step to protecting vulnerable groups but specific measures also need to be in place. Keeping the number of cases of COVID-19 as low as possible in the community provides the greatest protection to those who are most vulnerable from the severest impacts of this disease. As such, preventing people becoming infected is still the most effective tool available to deal with COVID-19.</p><p>The Government has already identified the high-risk conditions and places where COVID-19 spreads most easily as well as the groups of people who are most likely to be affected and are most vulnerable to the disease. We continue to ensure implementation of the existing measures and will advance additional measures to prevent spread in these high-risk areas. We are aware that older people, particularly those who are medically compromised or frailer, are at severe risk for poorer outcomes from COVID-19, and that congregated settings such as long-term residential care facilities have been severely impacted.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommended the establishment of an Expert Panel on Nursing Homes to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort. The Report of the COVID-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel includes 86 recommendations in total, over 15 thematic areas, with associated timelines for implementation over the short, medium and long term.  I have established an oversight structure to ensure the implementation of the important recommendations contained in this Report. This encompasses the establishment of both an Implementation Oversight Team and a Reference Group. I can advise the Deputy that there is a key focus on the implementation of recommendations that require immediate action to ensure ongoing preparedness as we move into the winter months. </p><p>Extensive guidance for medically vulnerable and other vulnerable groups has been produced by the HPSC and can be found at </p><p>I understand that the HPSC has recently published guidance for Older People and Others at Risk of Severe Disease on Reducing Risk of COVID-19 Infection.  It is noted that the guidance should be used in line with the Five Level Framework.</p><p>Guidance%20For%20Older%20People%20and%20Others-Reducing%20COVID-19%20Exposure%20Risk.pdf</p><p>Last week, the &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign was launched, which aims to support people and communities to mind their physical and mental health over the coming months. The &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign is aimed at showing people of all ages how we can mind our own physical and mental health and wellbeing by adding healthy and helpful habits to our daily and weekly routines. It will provide guidelines, information, and tips on things that will help us keep well through the coming months. The campaign is focussed on five main themes: Keeping active; Staying connected; Switching off and being Creative; Eating Well; and Minding your mood. All of these themes are relevant to older persons, with staying connected with people, addressing isolation, supporting volunteerism and initiatives that support person-to-person connection being particularly  important to wellbeing for older persons. Building on the Community Call response earlier in the year, Local Authorities are being supported to provide a local community helpline and befriending service. Working with partner organisations, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, NGOs and Volunteer Ireland, there will be a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting those most at risk of isolation.</p><p>There are a range of existing services which offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. Details of these services are listed on the HSE website, www.yourmentalhealth.ie, and information on available services is also provided through the free mental health telephone information line, 1800 111888.  In order to respond to the anticipated additional needs of the population during this crisis, additional online services are being delivered to support the population, including online counselling, expanded crisis textline support and online life skills training, building on existing pilot schemes and developments in digital mental health in recent years.</p><p>Finally, I understand that the fieldwork for an interim TILDA (The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing) survey has been completed. Part of this data will capture the experience of cocooning during the 1<sup>st</sup>wave of the pandemic and the analysis will seek to determine the impact of cocooning on a range of health and social outcomes. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Since early June 2020 University Hospital Kerry (UHK), in line with other hospitals throughout the system, have gradually re-commenced services. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals, including UHK, are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity. </p>  <p>  The South/South West Hospital Group has advised my Department that UHK is currently not providing an Elective Orthopaedic service, however, patients requiring joint replacements are being referred to the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee for treatment and 96 patients have been referred under the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to date.  UHK are also in the process of drafting a plan to resume elective orthopaedic surgery.  </p>  <p>  The HSE have further advised that Orthopaedic Trauma/Emergency services in UHK have resumed in full. Plans are being put in place to send referrals from the UHK Orthopaedic Outpatient waiting list to the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee under the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus.</p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions, and must exercise within 5km of home. No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional elite sports and senior inter-county gaelic games and horse and greyhound racing, which may continue behind closed doors. All other training activities should be individual only. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise. It is appreciated that these measures are difficult, but they have been put in place to protect public health.</p><p>You may wish to note that recreational hunting is not among the exemptions provided for under the current regulations - the Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020)(S.I. No. 448 of 2020). </p><p>It is also important to note that individuals who have hunting licences or other licences issued by the National Parks and Wildlife Service under the Wildlife Acts, must adhere to all public health guidelines at level 5. Further information on this and hunting at level 5 is available from the National Parks and Wildlife Service at the following link: </p><p>The Government's guidelines for exercise and sporting events at all levels of the Plan are available at: .

The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) for data collection and data management expertise</p>  <p>  The NTPF has advised that they do not currently record the personal data of any of the patients on the Diagnostics waiting list as the purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MR and US. This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting lists- local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the NTPF are not able to identify whether patients on the Diagnostics waiting list are over or under 18 years of age.</p></reply>

Validation is the process whereby hospital administration contacts patients on waiting lists at pre-planned intervals during the year to ensure that patients are ready, willing, suitable and available to attend a hospital appointment or wish to be removed from the waiting list. For a number of years validation was conducted at individual hospital level in Ireland but in 2018, the Minister for Health approved the establishment of the National Centralised Validation Unit (NCVU) within the NTPF. The establishment of a centralised function has facilitated the introduction of a standardised approach to validation of waiting lists across all hospitals and across IPDC and OPD waiting lists. </p><p>The NCVU advises that the validation of waiting list process which had been suspended at the end of March due to COVID-19, recommenced on 7th August. Between 1st January and the end of October 2020 a total of 23,706 patients were removed from the Outpatient waiting list as a result of validation.</p><p>In relation to the data requested by the Deputy, the NCVU provided the attached document which outlines outpatient validation figures by hospital from 1st January to end October 2020.</p></reply>

This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation . The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. </p><p>The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. The latest public health advice on these matters is available at the links below and is updated on a regular basis:</p><p>.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation . The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. As such, engagement with sporting organisations is more appropriate to Sport Ireland and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  At Level 5, no training or matches should take place, with the following exceptions:</p>  <p>  -  non-contact training can continue for school aged children, outdoors in pods of 15</p>  <p>  -  professional, elite sports and senior inter-county Gaelic games, horse-racing and greyhound racing are permitted to continue behind closed doors.</p>  <p>  Carded swimmers and those in the high performance programme can therefore continue their training at Level 5. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland issued guidance to all of the National Governing Bodies, including Swim Ireland, on 22 October on participation in sport during Level 5.  That guidance outlines the position regarding professional and elite sportspersons, who are permitted to train during Level 5. The guidance is available here: www.sportireland.ie/news/return-to-sport-expert-group-issues-guidance-to-sports-sector.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports and exercise are central to our well-being and are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I'm sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. </p><p>You will be aware that in response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, Ireland has moved to level 5 of <i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19</i>. This means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.</p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions. Taking exercise, within 5km of home, is among the exemptions provided for. No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional elite sports and senior inter-county gaelic games and horse and greyhound racing, which may continue behind closed doors. All other training activities should be individual only. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise. It is appreciated that these measures are difficult, but they have been put in place to protect public health.</p><p>The Government recognises that there are many aspects of normal life that have been altered by the emergence of COVID-19, and the response that has been required. It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted -such as certain forms of exercise, but also eating out, attending church, travelling abroad freely - are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>The Government's guidelines for exercise at all levels of the Plan are available at: www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/. Level 5 guidance from Sport Ireland is available at: www.sportireland.ie/news/return-to-sport-expert-group-issues-guidance-to-sports-sector.</p></reply>

In those circumstances, and to avoid the situation where no night time service would be available for Priority 1 paediatric transplant patients, the HSE undertook a procurement process and a private provider was contracted to provide cover during these periods; daytime air transfers continue to be carried out by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard, as appropriate.  The contract with the private provider will expire early next year and it is now necessary for the HSE to commence a procurement process in order to ensure that there will be no gap in service provision.  In the meantime, my officials continue to engage with officials in the Department of Defence in relation to service provision and the ongoing capacity and availability of the Air Corps to support the HSE.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific enquiries I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

All Symptomatic Breast Disease (SBD) clinics remained open and accepting referrals during the Covid-19 pandemic.  In the light of Covid, clinical priority was given to referrals triaged as urgent.  All SBD clinics have had to reduce capacity in line with guidelines on social distancing and infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures.  St James&rsquo;s Hospital (SJH) has a high rate of annual breast referrals. Patient&rsquo;s categorised as not having a high suspicion of malignancy (based on GP referral data) are classified as non-urgent and the aim is to offer an appointment to these patients within 12 weeks.  SBD clinics are struggling to meet the 12 weeks performance indicator in the current environment.  Steps being taken to address this include validating the patient lists, additional clinics and streaming some patients into a radiology first pathway in the short-term where appropriate.</p><p>Funding has been allocated as part of the Winter Plan and Budget 2021 to restore cancer diagnostic and treatment services to 95% of 2019 capacity.  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme continue to monitor performance of SBD clinics on a monthly basis and to work with the clinics to support these services.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the BreastCheck programme resumed breast screening on 27 October. The focus of the restart is to achieve the maximum screening invitation rate that is compatible with safe and controlled follow-up  assessment and treatment capacity.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports and exercise are central to our well-being and are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. </p><p>In response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, Ireland has moved to level 5 of . </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions, and must exercise within 5km of home. Exercise and sporting amenities such as golf courses have been closed in order to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread. No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional elite sports and senior inter-county gaelic games and horse and greyhound racing, which may continue behind closed doors. All other training activities should be individual only. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise.</p><p>The Government recognises that there are many aspects of normal life that have been altered by the emergence of COVID-19, and the response that has been required. It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted -such as playing golf, but also eating out, attending church, travelling abroad freely - are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>Regarding the impact of the closure of exercise and sporting amenities on the overall R number, I have been advised by the Irish Epidemiology Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG), that it is not feasible to provide reliable estimates of the impact of very specific interventions.  In order to do this, a series of assumptions would need to be made in relation to the number of close contacts that occur in a setting, the number of close contacts that occur in the population as a whole, the relative risk that such close contacts lead to infection, and the effect of mitigating measures such as the use of PPE. Small changes in these assumptions lead to very different outcomes in terms of impact upon the R number.  <i></i></p><p>For your information, technical notes on the approaches used to estimate effective reproduction number (Re) or time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) are published on the Department of Health website <i></i></p><p>I would also draw your attention to the CSO website for access to a range of data relating to Covid-19 including data on confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to sporting activity/fitness outbreaks. This is available on the CSO Covid-19 Information Hub at www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-covid19/covid-19informationhub/ and, in particular, at <i></i></p><p>A range of data on the epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland, including data on county incidence levels and trends in transmission, is also published in the daily report by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/epidemiologyofcovid-19inireland, while a daily report on the last 14 days in cases available at: .  <i></i></p><p>The Government's guidelines for exercise and sporting events at all levels of the Plan are available at: .

This is a new Reserve, and the particulars of how it will be distributed will be agreed after the Commission has presented its proposals for the Reserve later this month.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the disproportionate impact that Brexit will have on Ireland, and especially on the Irish agri-food sector. Agri-food trade with or through Great Britain is going to be impacted by new customs and regulatory requirements and associated costs that will apply from 1 January 2021. It is important that all operators understand that these requirements will apply whether there is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or not. Additionally, there is a serious potential impact from the EU and UK tariff schedules which would be imposed on trade between Ireland and Great Britain if a FTA that provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas is not agreed between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  My Department has put in place financial and budgetary measures to help the agri-food and fisheries sectors meet the Brexit challenges they have faced to date. The Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan makes it clear that further measures to support businesses and affected sectors will be considered in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Adjustment Reserve will be an important additional support for those adjusting to the new reality of trading with the UK as a third country. Every effort will be made to ensure that the agri-food sector gets an allocation from this Reserve that is commensurate with the impact on the sector.</p></reply>

The national forest estate is an important store for carbon, estimated at over 312 million tonnes.  Ireland&rsquo;s total forest area is not a net emitter of greenhouse gases and is a substantial sink for carbon dioxide compared to other land uses. </p>  <p>  As part of the implementation EU Regulation 2018/814, Ireland, like all EU Member States, had to submit a National Forestry Accounting Plan which sets out the emissions and removals resulting from older forests. These forests for the purposes of greenhouse gas accounting under the regulation are referred to as &ldquo;managed forest lands&rdquo;. The regulation also requires that a forest reference level is set for the period 2021-2025. This reference level is needed in order to account and report greenhouse gas changes from 2021-2025 against this land category, representing about 60% of the forest estate. Ireland&rsquo;s forests in this category include all forests that are older than 30 years of age during the period 2021-2030. While the Managed Forest Lands (MFL) area, because of particular circumstances and timing, will be a small emitter over the upcoming period, the amount in question will be far outweighed by what the rest of the estate is storing and sequestering.</p>  <p>  Forests that are less than 30 years of age during the period 2021-2030 must also be accounted for under EU regulation 2018/841 and are referred to as the &ldquo;Afforested Land&rdquo; category. Over that period, these forests will be a significant sink for carbon dioxide, sequestering on average between 1 and 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year, when harvested wood products are included and depending on the levels of afforestation and deforestation.</p>  <p>  The important point to note is that the entire forest estate under long term projections is and will remain a net sink for carbon dioxide up to 2050 as outlined in the National Forest Accounting Plan. Detailed modelling, projections and sensitivity analysis will be required to estimate carbon removals post 2050 in conjunction with the level of harvest, afforestation and deforestation in the coming decades.</p></reply>

When public libraries closed on March 12th, the usage of online library services soared to unprecedented levels. In response to this increased demand my Department provided funding of &euro;400,000 to support the provision of additional eBooks and eAudiobooks. Indeed, the public library sector has already shown its flexibility by moving three of their annual programmes - <i>Spring into Storytime,</i><i>Summer Stars</i>and <i>Children's Book Festival </i>- online at very short notice. </p><p>Last month I approved Dormant Accounts funding of over &euro;600,000 to support the provision of library programmes for marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities.

It will also fund new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme, and it will support the administration costs of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as the projects are completed.

During 2020 alone, Donegal received an allocation from the RRDF of over &euro;372,000. </p>  <p>  Under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, over &euro;295,000 in funding has been provided to projects in Donegal so far this year, while &euro;500,000 was provided through the Outdoor Infrastructure Recreation Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department has also provided funding through a number of community development programmes, including SICAP and the Community Enhancement Programme to the North West and to County Donegal.  In addition, in recognition of the challenges posed by COVID-19, my Department has provided funding to support rural communities throughout the country through the COVID-19 Emergency Fund and the Community and Voluntary COVID-19 Stability Scheme. </p>  <p>  Full lists of projects supported by my Department are available on my Department's pages on the Gov.ie website.  These will provide a comprehensive picture of the supports provided to the North West under the various schemes. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme, which will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.  </p>  <p>  The objective of this commitment is to allow rural development projects to continue to be delivered under a Transitional Programme, using the LEADER model, until the new EU programme commences.  </p>  <p>  The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed. We are therefore planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Transitional Programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, but with the scope to extend this if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament.  </p>  <p>  The total allocation for LEADER next year is &euro;44 million.  This allocation will be used to fund existing projects as they come to completion and submit payment claims. It will also fund new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme, and it will support the administration costs of the LAGs in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as the projects are completed. Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021.</p>  <p>  The design, duration and composition of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme.  </p></reply>

PPNs contribute to community development by giving local volunteer-run groups a direct voice within the formal decision-making structures of the local authority.</p><p>Following the Covid-19 outbreak, my Department has liaised with all PPNs in relation to their business continuity planning and has provided a range of practical advice on how best to continue their operations and benefit their member groups during this challenging period.</p><p>Under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, my Department is providing funding of approximately &euro;190m over 2018 to 2022 to local development companies across Ireland allowing them to develop the capacity of individuals and community groups in their area.</p><p>Separately, the Programme for Partnership Government commits to introducing a number of projects similar in approach to community development projects.  Officials in my Department are currently scoping a proposal which would support a small number of existing independent community development organisations to work with marginalised communities and support flexible and innovative community work initiatives. </p><p>Theese are some examples of how my Department supports Community Development across Ireland.  Other schemes and programmes such as the Community Enhancement Programme and the Community Services programme provide further assistance in this regard.

This funding supports the immediate response of towns and villages to COVID-19 and includes 14 projects totalling &euro;414,700 in Kildare. </p><p>The Seniors Alert Scheme facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people. A total of 1841 installations have been approved for elderly persons in Kildare since September 2015. </p><p>The Local Improvement Scheme, or LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas. The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.  The funding allocated to Kildare is &euro;250,000 for 2020.</p><p>The Community Services Programme, or CSP, supports community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model with funding provided as a contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions and a manager, where warranted.  In 2020, the CSP provided funding of some &euro;436,098 towards the cost of employing over 17 full-time equivalents and three managers in five community-based organisations and social enterprises based in Co Kildare. This funding included &euro;7,000 which was provided to two of the organisations through the Support Fund, to ensure that they could pay their full-time CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees.  The Expression of Interest (EOI) application process is currently closed but it is expected that the programme will open targeted calls, to address identified gaps in service delivery, in 2021. </p><p>The COVID Stability Fund provided a once-off cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical frontline services to the most in need in our society. Five organisations in Kildare were allocated &euro;613,362 in funding through the Fund.  </p><p>The Department also put in place the &euro;2.5m COVID-19 Emergency Fund to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that participated in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative.  Co Kildare was allocated funding of &euro;94,390.00.</p><p>Requests for assistance under particular programmes can be made at the appropriate time in respect of the application period for each programme, and these details, along with eligibility criteria and other information, can be found on the Government's website </p></reply>

My Department has ensured an element of flexibility is retained in our programmes in order to allow for responses to needs that emerge as the impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit become clear.</p>  <p>  My Department will also continue to engage on these important issues with relevant stakeholders in the rural and community development sectors and our partners in delivering our programmes, to ensure we remain aware of the needs of communities across the country as they deal with these ongoing and emerging challenges.</p>  <p>  Already this year, my Department has been able to provide some specific funding in response to the impacts on Covid-19 in communities. A Support Fund of &euro;1.2m was put in place under the Community Services Programme (CSP) earlier this year, providing additional funding to many of the more than 400 CSP-supported organisations which had suffered a loss of income due to the Covid-19 restrictions.  </p>  <p>  My Department also introduced a package of supports for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises in the context of COVID-19, which included a Stability Fund of up to &euro;35 million.</p>  <p>  Additional funding totalling &euro;17million was provided to my Department under the July Stimulus package, allowing increased investment of &euro;5 million under the Community Enhancement Programme, an extra &euro;2million in funding for the Islands, and an increase of &euro;10 million, to a total of &euro;25 million, in the funding available under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, which this year was tailored to assist our rural towns and villages to respond to the challenges presented by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, I was delighted to secure an increased allocation for my Department of &euro;341 million under Budget 2021. This increase of &euro;23 million will ensure we can continue to increase our supports to local communities next year and provide the appropriate responses to future impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit.</p></reply>
