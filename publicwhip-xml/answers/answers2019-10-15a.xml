    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-15a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101500058#WRA03300"><p>In July 2019, Iceland communicated its decision to the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) to increase its unilateral quota for mackerel for 2019 from 107,000 to 140,000 tonnes. As a result, the share of the Icelandic unilateral quota has effectively increased to 21.5% of the overall TAC. Since 2014, they have had an average unilateral TAC of 16.5% - well in excess of the amount set aside for the three parties outside the agreement.</p>  <p>  I am strongly opposed to this latest action by Iceland.  Ireland, as the second largest shareholder in the EU, has led calls for strong measures to be taken in response to this unilateral and unsustainable action. The parties to the 2014 agreement, EU, Norway and Faroes have jointly written to Iceland demanding that they reverse this action. The situation has been exacerbated by both Greenland and Russia also increasing their unilateral quotas, albeit at a lower level.  The EU, Norway and Faroes have also written to those countries.</p>  <p>  The issue has been discussed at the Council Fisheries Working Party on a number of occasions and I also raised the matter at the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg this week.  </p>  <p>  The advice from ICES for the Total Allowable Catch for 2020 is 922,064 tonnes. This would equate to a 41% increase on the 2019 TAC of 653,438 tonnes.  In my view, there is absolutely no reason for the full ICES advice not to be applied and this is the position that Ireland will be arguing for at the consultations taking place in London this week. </p></reply>

Budget 2020 provides for residual payments under this programme. I am fully committed to the future of the Knowledge Transfer Programme however, and will be working in 2020, towards the development of a new programme in due course, within the confines of available resources. </p>  <p>  Negotiations in relation to the post-2020 CAP regulations are ongoing and these will form the basis for the next iteration of CAP schemes when they are finalised.  It is envisaged that knowledge transfer measures will form a key part of the next CAP.</p>  <p>  At present, the Department is seeking submissions from stakeholders in relation to the SWOT analysis which will underpin the range of measures to be included in the next CAP.</p></reply>

This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.</p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.</p><p>My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef Producer Organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.</p><p>I have established a Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. The Taskforce will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the Agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Furthermore, the Beef Market Taskforce will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.</p><p>I have appointed Michael Dowling as independent Chair of the Taskforce, and its membership includes representatives from my Department, relevant State agencies, farm organisations and the meat industry.  The Beef Taskforce scheduled for yesterday, 14 October, was adjourned, as members of the Taskforce were prevented from attending the meeting.  It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the Taskforce goes ahead.  The Taskforce&rsquo;s remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September and offers  the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the Taskforce.</p></reply>

BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The implementing regulation was within the competence of the European Commission; member states were invited to comment on the contents of the draft regulation, however, it was not open for negotiation.  Ireland subsequently published a formal notification of the scheme as required under the regulation. </p>  <p>  The scheme was designed to target aid to those who had been most impacted by the market disturbance for which it was requested. The reduction/restructuring requirement was required by the Commission; it was also required to be at individual farm level. </p>  <p>  As the scheme is voluntary, it is a decision for individual eligible farmers as to whether to participate or not.  In response to requests from farm bodies, the period for receipt of applications was extended to 20 September and there was support and advice available to prospective applicants from my Department at the National Ploughing Championships.   </p>  <p>  In total 34,517 applications were received, representing a potential payment of &euro;78,192,380. A further 560 applicants, who did not qualify for the support as they had failed to meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the scheme Terms and Conditions, submitted an application under appeal in order to have their eligibility for the scheme reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Under the implementing regulation, Ireland may grant additional national support for the measures taken under Article 1 of the regulation up to a maximum of 100% of EU funding. Therefore, undrawn funds cannot be used for other purposes outside of the measure.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be glad to know that, in Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports.  I intend to consult with stakeholders as to the use of these funds.  </p>  <p>  In addition,  in the event of a No-Deal Brexit, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed in Budget 2020 that a Brexit contingency fund of &euro;650 million will be available to support our most vulnerable sectors, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts emerge. &euro;110 million will be made available through my Department in the first tranche, of which &euro;85 million will be provided in immediate supports for beef farmers. This will, of course, be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU under the CMO regulation.</p></reply>

In addition, the sector will also deliver an additional 26.8 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq cumulative abatement through better land use management such as afforestation and improved management of peaty grasslands.  </p><p>The plan identifies 34 actions for the sector that will contribute to our transition to a low carbon economy and society across abatement measures, carbon sequestration measures and displacement of fossil fuels and reflects our three-pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production of:  </p><p>1. Reducing agricultural emissions; </p><p>2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and  </p><p>3. Displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p><p>These actions in the plan are informed by the recent Teagasc Marginal Cost Abatement Curve report (MACC) - An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030 as an identifiable suite of actions for delivery. These actions include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures. </p><p>While the target for the sector is challenging, immediate action and early adoption is key and there are three important actions that can be advanced immediately. </p><p>- Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices.  </p><p>- Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading or introduction of clover in grassland swards; and </p><p>- Continuing our support for research and innovation such as the potential of novel feed additives in grass-based production systems. </p><p>To reach the target of 19 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq or lower in 2030 will require us to manage the emissions profile from the sector between now and then through mobilisation of as many of these actions as possible as early as possible with high levels of take-up across our 139,000 farms. While I am confident that these actions once implemented early can deliver emissions reductions that would allow maintenance of our current national herd count, market conditions are likely to indicate a reorientation of systems within the herd.</p><p>There are already a significant number of measures in place which support these actions ranging from enhanced regulation to improve nitrogen use efficiency such as seen in the recent review of our Nitrates derogation to incentives which encourage afforestation and improved animal efficiency such as the BDGP and BEEP schemes.  However, I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.</p><p>Higher ambition on environmental and climate action are part of the new CAP, post-2020, and it is proposed that 40% of the overall CAP budget will contribute to climate action. This will require farmers to achieve a higher level of environmental ambition through both mandatory and incentive-based measures.  All mechanisms, such as the CAP reform, market incentive and regulation will be investigated in full by all the relevant stakeholders, including industry, to mobilise the necessary actions as swiftly as possible.  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.</p></reply>

The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level is 296 to the value of &euro;50.1m. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, the Government announced that it will provide a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; contingency fund to support our most vulnerable sectors, with up to &euro;650 million available overall, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts of Brexit emerge.  &euro;110 million will be made available for the agri-food sector in the first tranche, to be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided by the EU.</p>  <p>  The provision of immediate supports for our beef sector will be a first priority, as will support for our fishing fleet. We also want to support food companies to re-orient towards new products and markets, and to support other sectors to improve their competitiveness.</p>  <p>  While supports cannot fully address the negative effects of a no-deal Brexit for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, this first tranche of supports will be used to ameliorate the immediate impact on farmers and fishermen, as the full impact of a no-deal Brexit crystallises, and to make some of the adjustments needed to improve resilience for businesses in the face of new market realities.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon (BnG) has informed me that of the 67,220 greyhounds raced from 1st January 2019 to date, 0.34% of these have been injured while 0.11% have been euthanized.   </p>  <p>  The percentage of greyhounds injured or put to sleep (PTS) has shown a downward trend in the last 5 year period. This is as a result of a continued focus by Bord na gCon on track maintenance and improvement procedures, together with the cancellation of racing where it is determined that there is a risk due to factors such as severe weather. It is intended as part of their priority focus on care and welfare to continue to improve the injury and PTS statistics. </p>  <p>  In August 2019, BnG introduced a Greyhounds Injured at Tracks Support Scheme which provides financial assistance for greyhound owners towards severe injuries so that the greyhound can continue a healthy life into retirement.

The areas targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  The Scheme remained opened for applications up to the 19 December and a total of 225 applications were received. The re-opening of the scheme was widely publicised at the time and all groups and their representatives on the Organic Strategy Group also publicised it to their members. </p>  <p>  The Organic Farming Scheme, under the current RDP, has more than achieved its targets in terms of new land converted and the maintenance of organic land.  The current budget allocation for the Organic Farming Scheme is now fully committed based on the current level of farmers in the scheme and I have no plans to re-open the scheme beyond last year's re-opening.  </p>  <p>  The Organic Strategy Group, in their deliberations considered the question of the Organic Farming Scheme post-2020.  The inclusion of an Organic Farming Scheme in a new Rural Development Programme was recommended to stimulate and support increased organic food productions.  As there will be more scope for adjustments to the scheme under a new Rural Development Programme, consideration was given by the Group to how it might operate more effectively in stimulating organic production in areas where market opportunities are greater.  </p>  <p>  CAP negotiations, currently in progress, will ultimately guide and shape the Organic Farming Scheme under the new RDP. I would urge all stakeholders to engage with the CAP consultation process currently underway and make their views known on a future scheme for the organic sector. </p></reply>

My Department and its agencies have been preparing themselves and the wider agri-food sector for the potential implications, and will continue to do so, through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement.  </p>  <p>  The Department has engaged with stakeholders through extensive outreach activities, including: </p>  <p>  - direct meetings with businesses and representative associations,  </p>  <p>  - attendance at the Ploughing championships and other agricultural shows, </p>  <p>  - participation in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready seminars, and  </p>  <p>  - through a focused communications campaign utilising its website, social media, and print and broadcast media. </p>  <p>  The Department is also encouraging relevant operators to register with Revenue for an EORI number, and with my Department as an importer or exporter, so that they can continue trading with the UK post-Brexit. A &lsquo;Brexit Checklist&rsquo; has also been prepared and widely distributed in recent months. </p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue trade data with the UK in 2018 has been used to identify nearly 30,000 agri-food importers and exporters, to whom a notice has been issued on my Department's behalf, encouraging them to take the necessary action if they haven&rsquo;t already done so. My Department has also recently hosted a number of Brexit seminars on &ldquo;Keeping Agri-food trade moving&rdquo;, attended by about 600 businesses and representative bodies.  These initiatives come on top of the stakeholder consultative meetings, sector-specific focus groups and meetings with representative bodies and individual companies that have been an ongoing component of our Brexit preparations. </p>  <p>  My Department established a dedicated Brexit Information line and Brexit Call email address earlier this year to assist anyone looking for information on Brexit, particularly those involved in agri-food trading with the UK.  The number of calls and queries has increased to approximately 100 per week as we approach the deadline of 31 October. </p>  <p>  I would urge agri-food businesses to avail of all of these services, and in particular to register with Revenue and with my Department as a matter of urgency, if they have not already done so.  </p></reply>

This is as a result of significant State investment. We now have a new challenge, to meet 8,000 hectare of new planting each year, as set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am very aware that this is in the face of declining planting rates. </p>  <p>  It will, I believe, require a collaborative effort from government, the private sector, public bodies and local communities to meet this target. For our part, I have commissioned a Scottish consultant to review my Department's processes and procedures on forestry applications and approvals similar to an exercise undertaken in Scotland.  I expect to receive this report by the end of November. </p>  <p>  Support from Government is delivered through the generous grants and premiums available, across 12 different planting categories which offer real options to suit every landowner.  Farmers can continue with livestock farming, while supplementing their income by planting trees, and we intend communicating this message widely.</p>  <p>  Public bodies have a role to play too.  I very much welcome the recent announcement by Coillte and Bord na Mona of their plans to plant 4 million native trees on 1,500 hectares over the next three years.  I will be encouraging others to follow suit.</p>  <p>  As regards diversification, the aim under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 is that 30% of all new trees planted are broadleaves. We achieved 27% in 2018.  This is a result of increased grants and premiums introduced under the Mid-Term Review of the Forestry Programme. We also increased the percentage of broadleaves in each new plantation from 10 to 15%. </p>  <p>  The Woodland Environmental Fund supports the planting of native woodland through supplementary support of &euro;1,000 a hectare from businesses. </p>  <p>  Finally, in support of the National Biodiversity Strategy, we have committed to increase the uptake of the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme five-fold during the lifetime of the current National Forestry Programme. </p></reply>

Over &euro;78 million has issued to successful applicants under the scheme during this time.  Over 9,500 applications have been received under the scheme in 2019.</p>  <p>  Also between 2015 and 2018 almost 8,000 successful applicants have benefitted from the National Reserve, with new allocations of payment entitlements valued in excess of &euro;30 million made to successful applicants during this time.  A further 780 applications have been received under the scheme in 2019. </p>  <p>  Under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of the enhanced grant rate of 60% as compared to the standard rate of 40%. Under this Scheme, &euro;74.5m has been paid to over 2,700 young farmers to date.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of national taxation measures aimed at young farmers, specifically the &lsquo;100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers&rsquo;.  Both of these measures assist farm succession and transfer. Other measures such as the relief from income tax for long-term leasing relief also benefit young farmers by increasing land mobility.  </p>  <p>  In addition, in 2017, I launched the 'Succession Farm Partnership Scheme'. This provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist with the transfer of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms. This scheme also encourages important conversations within farm families regarding succession planning.  </p>  <p>  Teagasc&rsquo;s recent publication &ldquo;Teagasc Education Vision &ndash; meeting future needs&rdquo; outlines the importance of education for young farmers and the development of their skills through education and training. This core function of Teagasc is supported and funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I launched the Future Growth Loan Scheme which is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security.  </p>  <p>  Supporting young farmers and generational renewal continues to be a priority for my Department and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020.  My Department and I are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU on these issues during the current negotiations on new CAP proposals.</p></reply>

This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus. The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.</p><p>A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the Agreement. These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers. </p><p>Actions specifically in relation to transparency include: </p><p>- An independent review of market and customer requirements, specifically in relation to the four in-spec bonus criteria currently in operation in the Irish beef sector; </p><p>- An independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain, and </p><p>- a summary of competition law issues as relevant to the Irish beef sector</p><p>- additional detailed price reporting on the Beef PriceWatch app;</p><p>- examination of transparency models in other jurisdictions; and</p><p>- a consultation process on the transposition of the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Directive.</p><p>In addition, Bord Bia will develop a beef market price index model based on 3 components: cattle price index, beef market price index (retail and wholesale) and an offal price indicator. </p><p>I have established a Beef Market Taskforce to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. The Taskforce will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the Agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Furthermore, the Beef Market Taskforce will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.  The Taskforce is comprised of key beef sector stakeholders, with Michael Dowling as independent chair. </p><p>The Beef Taskforce scheduled for yesterday, 14 October, was adjourned, as members of the Taskforce were prevented from attending the meeting. It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the Taskforce goes ahead.  The Taskforce&rsquo;s remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September and offers  the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the Taskforce.</p></reply>

The proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland, and I have used every opportunity in the course of discussions at EU Agriculture Council meetings to call for the CAP budget to be maintained.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that funding for the CAP is outside the remit of Agriculture Ministers.  Negotiations on the MFF proposals are running in parallel to the CAP post-2020 negotiations, and agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  There are diverging views amongst Member States on the appropriate level for the budget, and further discussion is required before agreement can be achieved.  The impact of Brexit further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK net contributions being removed from the EU budget post-2020.  </p>  <p>  I have been working with my European counterparts to raise awareness and build consensus around maintaining a strong CAP budget post 2020:</p>  <p> - In May 2018, I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid, calling for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post-2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers. </p>  <p> - I have consistently called for an adequate CAP budget to meet the increasing demands being placed on farmers, in particular in achieving greater climate ambition.  I have held multiple bilateral meetings with my European colleagues and have also raised the matter on several occasions with Commissioner Hogan.</p>  <p> - Yesterday, at the Agrifish Council in Luxembourg, I joined with 16 Ministers from a number of EU Member States to reiterate the call for the CAP budget to be maintained post-2020, to meet the new challenges faced by European agriculture and forestry. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my European counterparts with a view to maintaining the CAP budget as the negotiations for the CAP post-2020 and its budgetary allocations progress.</p></reply>

In line with EU requirements, this budget must cover measures and sub-measures as set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1305 of 2013. The funding was allocated and phased over the Programme period in line with the requirements of measure design and budgetary resources. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to reallocate funding already committed under the RDP to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II).  I am satisfied that the RDP as a whole will spend its entire budget and, therefore, there is no scope for substantial reallocations across schemes.  </p>  <p>  The total budget allocated under the TAMS II is &euro;395m which is a substantial allocation for a capital investment scheme.  To date, total expenditure under TAMs, including transitional expenditure, has exceeded &euro;170m and we continue to pay approximately &euro;1.4m every week. The annual budget allocations are, of course, subject of the usual  national budgetary processes.  I was very pleased, therefore, to announce that the 2020 budget for TAMS II payments will amount to &euro;81.5m. This represents an increase of over 17% on the 2019 budget.</p>  <p>  TAMS II continues to be very popular with Irish farmers. Over 2,600 new applications were received under tranche 15 which closed recently, when added to the applications rolled over from the previous tranche, means that there are 3,300 applications for consideration.  The Deputy should also be aware that there are some 12,000 approved applications with farmers who have yet to submit payment claims. These outstanding payment claims represent committed expenditure worth approx &euro;145m.  Until such time as these approvals are acted upon or expire, the budget for TAMS must include provision for the potential expenditure involved.  Current estimates indicate that the total budget available will be fully spent. </p></reply>

These objectives are to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices, to establish and carry on woodland industries, and to participate with others in forestry and related activities consistent with its objectives.  </p>  <p>  This mandate already enables Coillte to provide a wide range of forestry services.  Coillte currently manages some 440,000 hectares of land, the bulk of which is under forestry. The company sells a range of wood products and its forests and lands also provide the public with a range of ecosystem services such as nature conservation, carbon sequestration along with extensive recreational opportunities. The launch of Coillte Nature expands it remit  and focuses on  non-commerical activities.  Its inaugural Dublin Mountains Conversion project  converts commercial forests to recreational forests and is supported by native woodland grants from  my Department.</p>  <p>  The company continues to look for options to establish new forests and is actively considering the role it can play in facilitating the overall growth of the national forest estate.  I welcome the recently announced collaboration between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na to plant 4 million native trees across 1,500 hectares of Bord na M&oacute;na land over the next 3 years. This project will bring a range of environmental benefits through the use of native species and will actively contribute to meeting the afforestation targets under the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan. I believe that there are other possibilities for Coillte to engage in afforestataion as indeed there are for other public bodies who own land. My Department will be engaging more intensively with these bodies to explore these opportunities. </p></reply>

BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty.</p>  <p>  The implementing regulation was within the competence of the European Commission; member states were invited to comment on the contents of the draft regulation, however, it was not open for negotiation.  Ireland subsequently published a formal notification of the scheme as required under the regulation. </p>  <p>  The scheme was designed to target aid to those who had been most impacted by the market disturbance for which it was requested. The reduction/restructuring requirement was required by the Commission; it was also required to be at individual farm level. </p>  <p>  As the scheme is voluntary, it is a decision for individual eligible farmers as to whether to participate or not.  In response to requests from farm bodies, the period for receipt of applications was extended to 20 September and there was support and advice available to prospective applicants from my Department at the National Ploughing Championships.   </p>  <p>  In total 34,517 applications were received, representing a potential payment of &euro;78,192,380. A further 560 applicants, who did not qualify for the support as they had failed to meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the scheme Terms and Conditions, submitted an application under appeal in order to have their eligibility for the scheme reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Under the implementing regulation, Ireland may grant additional national support for the measures taken under Article 1 of the regulation up to a maximum of 100% of EU funding. Therefore, undrawn funds cannot be used for other purposes outside of the measure.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be glad to know that, in Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports.  I intend to consult with stakeholders as to the use of these funds.  </p>  <p>  In addition,  in the event of a No-Deal Brexit, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed in Budget 2020 that a Brexit contingency fund of &euro;650 million will be available to support our most vulnerable sectors, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts emerge. &euro;110 million will be made available through my Department in the first tranche, of which &euro;85 million will be provided in immediate supports for beef farmers. This will, of course, be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU under the CMO regulation.</p></reply>

Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32m for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna FR 172H fleet. The contract is well underway and it is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper  also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft has recently been completed in my Department and a preferred bidder has been identified. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2019 allocation. The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to continue the programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included for funding.</p></reply>

Sheep grazing and horse racing are centuries-old practices on Curragh lands and in addition the entire Plains are a working facility for the Defence Forces.

The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his/her passport application.</p>  <p>  As part of the identity and citizenship verification process, the Passport Service requires applicants themselves, or the applicant&rsquo;s guardian in the case of applications for children, to submit all necessary supporting documents in order to establish the applicant&rsquo;s identity and entitlement to citizenship. It is not possible for the Passport Service to obtain these documents on an applicant&rsquo;s behalf from other State or non-State bodies. </p>  <p>  The applicant referred to was born in Ireland after 1 January 2005. Any possible claim to citizenship for the applicant is governed by the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended (&ldquo;The 1956 Act&rdquo;). Section 6A of the 1956 Act provides that a person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person&rsquo;s birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding his/her birth.</p>  <p>  In such cases, proofs of lawful residence in the State are required to determine if a parent has the required three year residence. The 2004 amendment of the 1956 Act makes particular provisions for nationals of EU Member States, who may make a declaration concerning their residence in the island of Ireland within the 4 years preceding their child&rsquo;s birth. In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided on the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proved. These declarations must be supported by documentary evidence to verify residence in the State. For non-EU parents, permission to remain in the State recorded on passports, and/or registration cards, as issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), are acceptable proofs of a parent&rsquo;s lawful residence in the context of a passport application.</p>  <p>  In this case, proof of lawful residence in the State for either of the parents for the required time-period prior to the applicant's birth was not submitted in support of the passport application. In the absence of such proof of lawful residence, an entitlement to citizenship, and therefore eligibility for an Irish passport, was not established. I am advised by the Passport Service that letters were issued to the applicant&rsquo;s father on 23 September and 30 September outlining what documents were required in order to establish this lawful residence. </p>  <p>  If lawful residence in the State for the required time-period cannot be established, it may be open to the applicant in question to apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation. A parent or guardian may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of a child if and when the conditions for naturalisation (including minimum residency terms) are satisfied. Citizenship, including naturalisation, comes under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. Further information on citizenship and naturalisation is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</p></reply>

Turkey commenced military operations on 9 October, with the stated aim of preventing &lsquo;the creation of a terror corridor&rsquo; along its border with Syria. These developments are deeply troubling. Turkey's military action has the potential to further destabilise a region which is still reeling from the fight against ISIS.</p>  <p>  While we understand Turkey&rsquo;s security concerns about its own territory, these concerns should be addressed through political and diplomatic means, in accordance with international humanitarian law. I am particularly concerned about the humanitarian impact of a military escalation and its potential to cause further displacement of civilian populations. In a statement on 9 October, I stressed that the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law must be paramount. </p>  <p>  I am also concerned about the long-term security implications of these developments. The fight against ISIS made decisive progress earlier this year. However, there remain individuals who have the potential to take advantage of any relaxation of vigilance Any unilateral military action against those groups which played a decisive frontline role in the fight against ISIS risks undermining this progress. It is also imperative that terrorist fighters remain securely detained, until their situation can be resolved, in order to prevent them joining the ranks of terrorist groups.</p>  <p>  The position of the EU was made clear in a Declaration released on 9 October by the High Representative, reaffirming that a sustainable solution to the Syrian conflict cannot be achieved militarily, and calling upon Turkey to cease the unilateral action. </p>  <p>  It is unlikely that the so-called &lsquo;safe zone&rsquo; in north-east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return as laid down by UNHCR. Ireland and the EU have maintained that returns of refugees and internally-displaced people to their places of origin must be voluntary, dignified and safe. The EU has been clear that any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable. The EU will not provide stabilisation or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored.</p>  <p>  All military action in Syria risks undermining the work of the UN in attempting to facilitate a negotiated end to the conflict, and a political transition which meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. I take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of the UN Special Envoy and urge all parties to engage with the UN-led process.</p></reply>

Ireland fully supports fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of assembly and the right to peaceful demonstration. As I have noted previously in this House, Ireland has consistently called for these freedoms to be upheld, while encouraging all sides to refrain from violence, to exercise restraint, and to engage in an inclusive dialogue. In that regard, we welcome recent moves towards dialogue from Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong authorities.</p>  <p>  I have not discussed the protests with my Chinese counterpart, as I have not had an opportunity to meet with him since the protests began in June. At a bilateral level, officials in my Department have engaged with the relevant Chinese authorities on the matter, including with representatives of the Hong Kong Government. Furthermore, the Consul General of Ireland in Hong Kong, and the Ambassador of Ireland to China, along with the EU Office, and representatives of other EU Member States in Hong Kong, have all been engaging regularly with Hong Kong authorities on this matter. </p>  <p>  The EU, with the support of Ireland, has issued statements in response to developments in Hong Kong. The most recent statement was released on the 2 October by High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU. This statement recalled the EU&rsquo;s support for the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; principle, and reiterated the EU position that restraint, de-escalation and dialogue are the only way forward. During the most recent session of the Human Rights Council on 10 September, the EU also expressed support for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' call for the demonstrations to remain peaceful and for the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom of assembly.</p>  <p>  The Consulate General of Ireland in Hong Kong, along with the Embassy of Ireland to China, and officials in my Department, continue to monitor the situation closely. </p></reply>

His recent hearing covered a broad range of issues in varying levels of detail and, while interesting as indications of his thinking, can only be properly evaluated within the institutional context in which the EU and its Member States work. </p>  <p>  The Treaty on the European Union stipulates that the Council adopts Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions by unanimity. While there are very limited circumstances in which Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) can be used, such as when appointing a Special Representative on the basis of a proposal by the High Representative/Vice President, the Treaty explicitly precludes decisions having military or defence implications from any such derogations. Under the Treaty therefore, EU military crisis management missions can only be approved by a unanimous decision of the Council. </p>  <p>  With regard to the security-related aspects of Mr Borrell&rsquo;s remarks, we understand them to refer in part to the European Defence Fund, but primarily to the proposed European Peace Facility, which remains under discussion at technical working group level in Brussels. Many aspects of the proposal remain unresolved in the technical discussions which are taking place in advance of any political decision on establishment of such a Facility. Such a decision is for the Council to make by unanimity.</p>  <p>  One of the specific issues which has not been agreed among Member States is the proposal to expand the share of costs from military CSDP operations which would be funded in common, rather than directly by the troop contributing State. As to the overall level of spending envisaged, the outgoing High Representative/Vice President proposed that the European Peace Facility should have a budget of &euro;10.5 billion over seven years. However, this budget would include all aspects of the proposed new European Peace Facility, including the incorporation into it of other existing EU initiatives which are currently funded through other mechanisms including, for instance, the African Peace Facility which funds important work by the African Union in preventing and resolving conflict on that continent. The proposed figure of &euro;10.5 billion over seven years has not been agreed by Member States. Many Member States, including Ireland, would regard this figure as excessive.</p></reply>

Ireland and the EU have been clear from the beginning that this situation can only be solved by political means, and that efforts to impose a military solution will be both fruitless and dangerous. We fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about a political resolution, starting with the implementation of the December 2018 Stockholm Agreement, which was signed by the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities.</p>  <p>  After more than four years of conflict in this extremely poor country, almost 80% of the population of Yemen is in need of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian access is a critical issue in a context where millions are unable to pay for food and medical care even when it is available, due to the collapse of the economy under the strains of conflict. Commercial access is also extremely important, since the Yemeni population cannot survive on aid alone. Bureaucratic impediments and delays to movements have unfortunately been common across Yemen, both in areas under Coalition or Government control, and areas controlled by the Houthis. It is imperative that the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement is progressed to ensure that humanitarian and commercial goods can enter Yemen freely.</p>  <p>  The EU is the largest donor to the UN Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM). UNVIM was established in May 2016 to facilitate more efficient verification that imports of commercial goods at Yemen's ports do not contain arms. Following the Stockholm Agreement, UNVIM has also been assigned the role of supporting the Yemen Red Sea Ports Corporation in the management and inspection of ports. Ships are checked for arms and other contraband by UNVIM first in Djibouti and again at an arrival point 30km off the port of Hodeidah. The UNVIM operation is making an important contribution to ensuring the continued flow of commercial goods to Yemen.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports of a recent surge in the number of ships which are waiting to dock in Yemen, due to additional checks being undertaken by the Coalition after UNVIM checks. I understand that this delay in access is leading to a fuel crisis in Yemen which is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation. UNVIM was established at the request of the official Government of Yemen, and these additional checks are not acceptable given the importance of these goods to the people of Yemen. </p>  <p>  I understand that UNSE Griffiths is currently working with all parties towards a solution which will bring the ships currently being held by the Coalition to dock in Hodeidah. Mr. Griffiths enjoys our full support in these efforts. </p>  <p>  I have made my views on the importance of unrestricted humanitarian access and the free flow of commercial goods to Yemen absolutely clear to the Coalition parties. At my last meeting with the Saudi Ambassador I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in this regard directly, and officials from my Department remain in regular contact with the Saudi and UAE embassies. Ireland does not have contact with the Houthis but my Department has made our concerns known to Iran, which has lines of communication with them. </p>  <p>  Ireland takes every opportunity to press for a political solution to the crisis in Yemen, and for an end to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and for unfettered humanitarian and commercial access to Yemen. Since 2015, Ireland has provided over &euro;21.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen, including a contribution of &euro;5 million this year. Ireland will continue to do what we can to assist the political and humanitarian effort in Yemen, through supporting the efforts of the UN, as well as advocating for an end to the conflict in our bilateral contacts.</p></reply>

However, even on a symbolic level, it risks marginalising Israeli citizens who are not Jewish, in particular the 20% of Israeli citizens who identify as Arab or Palestinian. It sends worrying signals about their status and their right to equality in the country which is their home. Some of these Israelis have expressed fears that the new law, which has the status of a Basic Law, may be a starting point for discrimination against minorities within Israel. There have been public demonstrations in Israel to express concerns about this Law, and concerns about the law have featured in debates during this year's Israeli election campaigns. </p>  <p>  The Israeli Declaration of Independence stated that Israel will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex. For those Israelis whose first language is Arabic, the official status which that language has hitherto had is symbolically important of their status as equal citizens, as well as being important from a practical perspective.  This law sets out to privilege Jewish communities, and I know that many Israelis, both Arab and Jewish, have reacted with dismay to this. </p>  <p>  A key point is that this new law states that "... the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people". Nobody is denying the strong connection between the Jewish people and Israel. But Israel is also a home to many who are not Jewish, and this law sends a worrying signal about their rights as Israeli citizens, and the part they have to play in Israel&rsquo;s democracy.   </p>  <p>  I am also particularly concerned about the references to Jewish settlement. There have been different interpretations of whether this refers to Israel only, or also to the West Bank, but the ambiguity is very unhelpful in a volatile situation. The Government is wholly opposed to the construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. This language is also extremely worrying in the context of a number of pieces of legislation being proposed, and already passed, by the Knesset, which blur the lines between Israel and the West Bank.</p>  <p>  The EU made its views on the Nation State Law known to Israel at the time, including the fact that this law could complicate the path to the two state solution. The law has not been specifically discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. Last year my Department signaled our concerns about the Nation State Law to the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. We continue to monitor the situation closely through our Embassy in Tel Aviv and Representative Office in Ramallah. Israel is currently in the process of forming a Government and we will continue to follow the actions of the new government in this area. </p></reply>

I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith, and I am meeting him this week, as we continue to work to seek an agreement between the parties to get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. </p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process with that objective over the last number of months.

The Syria crisis has persisted for eight and a half years, and refugees have had to remain in neighbouring countries far longer than expected. Lebanon has welcomed a particularly large number of refugees from Syria, reportedly up to 1.5 million people. This number is equivalent to a third of the country&rsquo;s population, and is the highest concentration per capita of refugees in the world. This has placed a huge strain on Lebanon&rsquo;s resources and public services, making daily life a struggle for many refugees and indeed for host communities also.</p>  <p>  Following rising concerns in Lebanon over the provision of public services, and with the Lebanese economy under severe pressure, there has been a growing wish in Lebanon that Syrian refugees would be in a position to return home. In May 2019 Lebanese authorities announced a decision to deport all Syrians who entered Lebanon irregularly after 24 April. I understand that Lebanon has already deported over 2,700 refugees to Syria under this decision. </p>  <p>  The EU recognises the right to safe, voluntary and dignified returns, as an individual right of refugees and internally displaced persons, and returns should be based on an accurate picture of the conditions in the cuontry of origin. Refugee returns require a sustainable and safe environment, rehabilitation and the restoration of national protection structures. Ireland shares the position of the European Union and UNHCR, that the conditions for safe and dignified returns are not currently met in Syria. Nor is it possible to monitor the reintegration of Syrian refugees back into their country of origin, to ensure their continued safety. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to show solidarity with refugee hosting countries, and has been a committed donor to the humanitarian needs of affected populations. This year, Ireland provided just over &euro;6m in direct assistance to UN agencies and NGOs operating in Lebanon. Our partners undertake programmes to provide basic assistance needs, as well as to provide resilience and livelihood opportunities for people living in protracted displacement. A further &euro;2.95m of funding earmarked by Ireland to the World Food Programme (WFP) for the Syria Region in 2019, has been disbursed in Lebanon.</p></reply>

Neighbouring countries who have been hosting millions of refugees, particularly Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, are under immense strain as services and resources are stretched to breaking point. The military action by Turkey in north-east Syria which began on 9 October risks exacerbating the situation with further displacements.  </p>  <p>  The EU is a key actor in responding to the Syrian crisis, and works with governments, the UN and with civil society across the region to provide support for refugees and host communities. The EU hosted the third conference on "Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region" in March 2019. The Conference renewed the political, humanitarian and financial commitment of the international community to support the Syrian people, and the neighbouring countries most affected by the conflict.  Pledges by participants amounted to &euro;6.2 billion for 2019, and multi-year pledges of close to &euro;2.1 billion. Ireland pledged &euro;25 million at the Conference, bringing our total funding for the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. </p>  <p>  In total, the EU and its Member States have mobilised almost &euro;17 billion since 2012 for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt. This figure includes a 2019 pledge of &euro;2.57 billion from the EU Budget.</p>  <p>  EU support is channelled through a range of partners including UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the World Food Programme, local and international NGOs, as well as EU Trust Funds. The EU&rsquo;s partners provide those in need with humanitarian supplies and access to urgently-needed health, education, water, and sanitation services, as well as cash-based assistance for Syrians affected by the crisis. </p>  <p>  Since its establishment in December 2014, a significant share of the EU&rsquo;s support to help Syrian refugees has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, which is focussed on an integrated EU aid response to address longer-term resilience for Syrian refugees, as well as easing pressure on host communities and their administrations. The EU also funds the Facility for Refugees in Turkey (FRIT), which aims to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees in Turkey and to bring about long-term sustainable improvements in their health, education and self-reliance.  </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have been clear in our support for those Syrian refugees who wish to return to their homes. However, we believe that any returns must be voluntary, dignified and safe, and based on an accurate picture of the conditions at home. </p>  <p>  I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday. We condemned Turkey&rsquo;s military action, which seriously undermines the stability and the security of the whole region, and urged Turkey to cease its unilateral military action in North East Syria and to withdraw its forces. Member States also unanimously agreed that they would suspend arms exports to Turkey.  </p>  <p>  The EU remains committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. This can be assured only through a genuine political transition in line with UNSCR 2254 and the 2012 Geneva Communique, negotiated by the Syrian parties within the UN-led Geneva process. Ireland will continue to work with the EU to respond to recent developments in north-east Syria, to contribute to the humanitarian effort, and to support the UN-led peace process.</p></reply>

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  </p>  <p>  I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010, and we saw the resumption of capital punishment in Bahrain in 2017 as a very negative development. Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Along with our EU partners, Ireland calls on Bahrain to again introduce a moratorium on executions, as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty. </p>  <p>  I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. I understand that a large number of prisoners held in Jau Prison in Bahrain went on hunger strike in response to these conditions. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. </p>  <p>  Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. We shall consider carefully any opportunity to participate in a joint statement at a future Human Rights Council session, and I have asked my officials to keep the matter under review.</p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister in New York last month I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

However, the Central Statistics Office, does  track the cost of insurance to consumers as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  </p><p>My officials advise me that the CPI statistics include price indices for certain types of insurance, such as health insurance, insurance related to a dwelling (property insurance), and motor insurance.  They would note however that it would be difficult to determine a meaningful figure for the increase or decrease in overall insurance costs as each type of insurance may not necessarily reflect an overall average figure.  However, with regard to the types of insurance with which I have policy responsibility for, I understand that the overall increase as per CSO data over the period requested for motor insurance is approximately 22.5% and for property insurance is approximately 19%.  The Deputy will appreciate that for motor insurance, this doesn&rsquo;t reflect the fact that prices fell in the early part of the decade, increased substantially between 2013 and 2016, and have since fallen 24% from their peak.  With regard to the figures for motor insurance between 2018 and 2019, the cost of motor insurance has decreased by 8.3% and the cost of property insurance has increased by 2.6%.  I would note however that insurance costs to businesses are not tracked through the CPI index therefore it is not possible to provide information on employer and public liability insurance.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations of the figures above, it is widely recognised that there have been issues around the cost and availability of insurance in more recent years, particularly with regard to motor, and employer and public liability insurance.  This is why the Government established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in 2016.  It has produced two reports, the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report</i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report,</i>and is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of each report.  Its most recent Progress Update was published in July and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed. Going forward, there are some further measures that will be carried out by Government over the next few months and into 2020.  These include the following:</p><p>- Commencement of the remaining parts of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>, which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum; this is an essential step if award levels are to be reduced.</p><p>- The completion of the Central Bank&rsquo;s feasibility study into adding Employer and Public Liability insurance to the National Claims Information Database (NCID). In addition, the first report of the NCID, on motor insurance, is due by the end of the year;</p><p>- The completion of the CSO&rsquo;s feasibility study into tracking the cost of business insurance, as it does with other forms of insurance including motor. The CSO is due to report back to my Department by the end of the year;</p><p>- The Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries. It is expected that there will be a public consultation on this by the end of the year; and,</p><p>- The furtherance of measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols (PAPs) for personal injury cases, beginning with medical negligence cases.</p><p>Finally, as mentioned above in the context of the commencement of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>, it is recognised that the single most essential challenge to be addressed, if we are to overcome issues regarding the cost and availability of insurance, is a sustainable reduction in insurance costs, in particular award levels.  In this regard, this Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.</p></reply>

This research paper can be accessed at:  . </p><p>I recognise that the research points to carbon tax increases disproportionately impacting low income households.  In order to minimise the impact of the increase on heating costs, I have delayed the increase on home heating fuels until 1st May 2020.  I am also increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week. This increase applies from the first of January 2020 and means an annual increase of &euro;56 to each household. Based on the findings from the aforementioned ESRI research, this will leave the 370,000 households who are in receipt of the fuel allowance better off than before the increase in the carbon tax. This ensures that the most vulnerable in society are protected from the increased carbon tax.</p><p>Alongside this I am providing increases to programmes that help to address the causes of fuel poverty. The Warmer Homes scheme provides free energy efficiency upgrades to households deemed to be in or at risk of energy poverty. This reduces the energy required to heat a home adequately, thus reducing a household&rsquo;s exposure to increases in energy costs.  This will be more effective in the long run at reducing heating costs than increases in the fuel allowance. An extra &euro;13m will be provided for this scheme in 2020, bringing its total budget allocation for the year to over &euro;50m.</p><p>These measures will help to protect the most vulnerable in society from the impact of the carbon tax increases in the short, medium and long term. </p></reply>

The work is being divided across two Pillars &ndash; Pillar One and Pillar Two.  </p><p>I understand that the deputy is referring to the public consultation document published on 9 October in respect of the &lsquo;Pillar One&rsquo; proposals. The consultation paper outlines a proposed &lsquo;Unified Approached&rdquo; developed by the OECD Secretariat after continuous consultation with countries.</p><p>The work under &lsquo;Pillar One&rsquo; focuses on the distribution of taxing rights in respect of highly digitalised activities and seeks to undertake a coherent review of the profit allocation and nexus rules used in the existing international tax framework.  There has been three differing proposals under discussion and this unified approach is an attempt to find consensus based on the common features of those proposals.  </p><p>The unified approach is an OECD Secretariat proposal to allow for discussion and to form the basis for future negotiation between countries. The unified approach has been referred to by the OECD as &ldquo;<i>sketching the first draft of an architecture</i>&rdquo; of an eventual solution. While the unified approach represents an advancement of the Pillar One proposals, there are significant remaining questions and a huge amount of technical consideration and discussion is still needed. </p><p>The detail of the proposal is set out in the OECD public consultation document which is available at:  </p><p>In summary, the OECD document proposes creating a new taxable nexus for certain highly digitalised consumer facing businesses and rules for calculating how much profit should be considered to relate to this new nexus.  At the same time, the approach largely retains the current transfer pricing rules based on the arm&rsquo;s length principle but complements them with new solutions in areas where tensions in the current system are the highest.</p><p>The proposal also seeks to increase tax certainty for taxpayers and tax administrations by agreeing rules on how the tax due in respect of marketing and distribution functions should be calculated.  </p><p>At this early stage it is not possible to estimate the potential impact in monetary terms of the implementation of any outcome which may eventually be agreed at the OECD.  Technical working parties at the OECD are examining the various issues in detail and no decisions have yet been made. Work on estimating any potential impact is underway by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners and this work will continue to evolve as the proposal develops. Currently however there is insufficient clarity to properly assess the potential impact on tax revenues of any of the proposals under discussion at the OECD. Ultimately any monetary impact will depend on the detail of whatever is actually agreed globally.</p><p>Regarding the issue of whether all countries must sign up to the proposal, the OECD operates on the basis of consensus.  It is hoped and envisaged that a consensual agreement is reached that all members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework will sign up to.  Where all countries do not sign up to a final proposal, this may damage the effectiveness of any agreement, and may result in further fragmentation to the international tax system with the potential for double taxation. </p><p>Ultimately, any changes will also need to be implemented by countries for them to be effective, either through domestic law changes or via multilateral instruments similar to the OECD BEPS Multilateral Instrument.</p><p>In terms of timelines, the OECD&rsquo;s ambition is to seek political agreement during 2020 although further technical work and work in respect of implementation is likely to continue over a longer period. </p><p>A further public consultation will be launched on the separate 'Pillar Two proposals' in mid-November.  </p><p>Ireland recognises that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  We remain convinced that the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework is the correct forum for this work to be carried out. There are a variety of views at the OECD table and the eventual outcome of the work will need to strike a balance to reflect these differing perspectives.</p></reply>

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I am conscious of the difficulties that the absence or withdrawal of flood insurance cover can cause to homeowners and businesses, and that is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  In May last year, the OPW completed the most extensive and comprehensive study on flood risk through the National Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme which identified the flooding risk to 300 communities. The Flood Risk Management Plans prepared under the CFRAM Programme identify 118 flood relief schemes in addition to the 35 flood relief projects that are already in design and development under the existing capital programme. I have been informed by the OPW that Flood Relief Works have already been completed in a number of areas in Limerick City, including Clancy&rsquo;s Stand and Harry&rsquo;s Mall (mid 2000&rsquo;s) and Howley&rsquo;s Quay (2012).</p>  <p>  Current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. This it believes should in turn lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  </p>  <p>  - implementation of flood relief management plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and   </p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.  </p>  <p>  This commitment is underpinned by a significant capital works investment programme to be delivered by the OPW and Local Authorities, and complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes. </p>  <p>  The nature of this arrangement is that, overall, there has been an increase in the provision of flood insurance cover observed in areas protected by these schemes over the period 2015 to 2019, according to Insurance Ireland Flood Survey Results. It should be noted that my Department is continuing to actively examine what can be done to increase the level of cover in areas with demountable defences.</p>  <p>  In terms of the use of flood maps and insurance provision, flood maps are community based maps and provide a useful resource for planning and cannot be used for commercial purposes. The Disclaimer and Conditions for Use of OPW Flood Maps on floodinfo.ie includes a provision that users of the website must not use the flood maps, or any other content of the website, for commercial purposes. It should be noted that the insurance industry has informed OPW that it uses its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties, and does not use the OPW Flood Maps to inform its flood modelling.</p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated. In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance ((01 676 1914 or feedback@insuranceireland.eu).  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-15a.251.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101500062#WRE03700"><p>At the outset, it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy. I understand that the Central Bank does not collect such information either.  Therefore, I am unable to provide the Deputy with information on the number of businesses impacted by increased employer and public liability insurance costs, or the number that might be expected to be effected by such increased insurance costs in the next couple of years.  </p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am very much aware that there are certain businesses that are having difficulties arising from either the affordability or even the availability of insurance, particularly in specific sectors such as leisure, hospitality and recreation. In this regard, the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), particularly its <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report </i>highlights these difficulties. Therefore, there is a clear understanding of the impact of this problem on businesses across the country.  </p><p>Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any direct role over the pricing of insurance products.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. A further constraint is the fact that, for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.</p><p>The Deputy should note however that through the work of the CIWG, there is a recognition that the single most essential challenge which must be addressed if we are to overcome the current cost and availability problems is to provide for a sustainable reduction in insurance costs. </p><p>In this regard, the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.  The PIC recommended that a Judicial Council be established and that it should compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. In carrying out this exercise, the PIC believes that the Judiciary will take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal, the results of its benchmarking exercise, etc.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019. </i>This Act provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee upon the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly.</p><p>Other steps taken to date to address the cost of insurance include the following: </p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The Central Bank is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding the scope of the Database to include employer and public liability insurance.  I would also note that the CSO is due to report to the CIWG shortly on a final view as regards the feasibility of tracking insurance prices for businesses, following completion of a pilot project it has been conducting on the same;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019</i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; </p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;</p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from September 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by certain businesses should recede.</p></reply>

The maximum rebate is 7.5 cents per litre when the retail price is &euro;1.25 (Vat exclusive) or above.   </p>  <p>  Certain qualifying criteria apply, for example, auto diesel must be purchased in the State, either in bulk (over 2,000 litres) or via a Revenue approved Fuel Card, and used in a qualifying vehicle for the purpose of business transport activities. Operators with a licence issued in other EU Member States are also eligible to claim on diesel purchased in the State subject to meeting all the other scheme criteria.</p>  <p>  The cost of this scheme depends upon the average retail price of diesel as well as the uptake of the scheme by qualifying road transport operators. While claims in respect of 413 million litres of diesel were made in respect of 2014, at a total cost of &euro;21 million, the relatively low price of oil in recent years has resulted in low costs for the scheme.

The rules aim to preserve national fiscal autonomy but, at the same time, to constrain the fiscal stance of individual Member States in order to ensure fiscal sustainability and prevent negative spill-overs to other participants. The EU&rsquo;s fiscal rules have been an integral part of our own fiscal framework for a number of decades, dating back to the Stability and Growth Pact in 1997. These rules were strengthened following the crisis, including through the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which was approved by referendum in Ireland in May 2012.  </p><p>Of course, no set of rules is perfect and on Budget Day, my Department published a scoping paper entitled <i>Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities. </i>Amongst other things, this paper identifies and outlines vulnerabilities arising from the &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approach taken by the European fiscal framework. From an Irish perspective, the fact that the rules are formulated in GDP terms is increasingly problematic. As my Department has outlined on many occasions, GDP overstates the &lsquo;true&rsquo; size of the Irish economy and, as such, ratios expressed as a share of GDP give a misleading picture. </p><p>In addition, the calculation of adherence to the MTO remains troublesome. This requires estimates of the structural budget balance: the headline balance adjusted for the impact of the economic cycle (cyclical component) and excluding temporary measures. The cyclical component, in turn, requires an estimate of the output gap - an unobserved variable that is calculated using a harmonised, one-size-fits-all approach which does not sit well with the Irish economy. The difficulties inherent in the structural balance are well understood in the EU. In many senses, some of these complexities are a necessary evil, as to promote counter cyclical policies, estimates of the cyclical position of the economy are needed. However, Ireland is more affected than most by these issues given the unique aspects of our economy.</p><p>These issues notwithstanding, I am encouraged by recent discussions regarding the fiscal rules at EU level. In particular, I support efforts to increase the transparency, predictability and simplicity of the rules. I, along with my officials, will continue to engage in these talks. That said, I do accept that there are difficult trade-offs involved. This means that finding agreement may be challenging. As such, we must continue to consider the domestic application of the existing fiscal rules. </p></reply>

Following the approval of the D&aacute;il, this increase has been applied to Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) rates for mineral oils used as auto-fuels (for cars and trucks) from midnight on 9 October 2019. All other MOT rates remain at their current levels until 1 May 2020 when new rates will take effect subject to the enactment of the Finance Bill 2019.   </p>  <p>  The current rate of MOT for marked gas oil (MGO), also referred to as &ldquo;green agricultural diesel&rdquo;, is &euro;102.28 per 1,000 litres, comprised of a carbon charge component of &euro;54.92 and a non-carbon charge component of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres.  These rates did not increase from Budget night. From 1 May 2020 the MOT rate for MGO will be &euro;117.78 per 1,000 litres, arising from the increase of the carbon component from &euro;54.92 to &euro;70.42; the non-carbon component will not change from its current level of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres. </p>  <p>  When carbon tax was increased in Budget 2012, provision was made for a tax relief for farmers to compensate them for the increase. The statutory basis for the tax relief is section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It is available to individuals and companies that carry on a trade of farming and are entitled to claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction in respect of farm diesel.   </p>  <p>  Section 664A provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline).  Revenue advise me that agricultural contractors are not entitled to this relief as they are not carrying on a trade of farming. This, they advise, is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires the occupation of farm land and agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farm land. However, Revenue agricultural contractors who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for those expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p></reply>

Such data as are available within the system relate to years before 2019 (no cap existed between 2015 and 2019).

Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty. The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes. </p><p>A Member State may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel for intra-community flights. With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention).  </p><p>VAT is charged on domestic and private usage of jet fuel at the reduced rate of 13.5%, while VAT is charged at the standard rate of 23% on aviation gasoline used for the same purpose.  The supply of aviation fuel for international air travel is zero rated and airline tickets are exempt from VAT throughout the EU.</p><p>I am advised that consumption data required to estimate the revenue that could be accrued, if the Excise Duty applied fully to aviation fuel with no exemptions, is not readily available. According to the CSO, the revenue foregone due to the excise exemption on aviation fuel was &euro;494 million in 2016. However, this is a theoretical amount that cannot be realised under the current EU and international legislative framework.</p><p>Finally, I am informed by Revenue that the breakdown of taxes levied on the different types of aviation fuel as provided for under the Finance Act 1999 and Energy Tax Directive are shown in the table below. <table><tr><th>Aviation Fuel/Use</th><th>Energy Tax Directive</th><th>Finance Act 1999</th></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for domestic commercial aviation </td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;369.42 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for intra-Community/international commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;369.42 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;601.69 per 1,000 litres (section 96 Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for domestic commercial aviation</td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for used for intra-Community/international commercial aviation</td><td>Mandatory tax exemption, except where bilateral arrangement entered into with another Member State</td><td>Full exemption (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for private pleasure flying</td><td>Mandatory taxation</td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;494.90 per 1,000 litres (section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999) </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In keeping with its mandate to protect the consumers of financial services, the Central Bank reviewed potential risks posed to consumers through the existence of commission arrangements between intermediaries and product producers. The Central Bank consulted with various stakeholders including the broker representative bodies. Officials from my Department also engaged with the Central Bank on CP 116 and they and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy met the broker representative groups on a couple of occasions as part of this overall process. However, it is important to note the independence of the Central Bank in carrying out this role.</p><p>In line with Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989, the Central Bank consulted with me as Minister for Finance prior to amending the code. They then published, on 25 September 2019, new rules to be included in the Consumer Protection Code 2012 on the payment of commission to financial intermediaries involving new requirements on transparency for consumers and prohibitions on certain types of commission arrangements. The Central Bank will be supervising firms&rsquo; compliance with these new rules when they come into effect on 31 March 2020. </p><p>Under the new rules, the Central Bank will require intermediaries to publish details of the commissions they receive from product producers on their website. In addition, the Central Bank will no longer permit intermediaries to describe themselves and their regulated activities as &lsquo;independent&rsquo; where they accept and retain commission in circumstances where advice is provided.  The Central Bank is enhancing the conflict of interest provisions- certain criteria must be met in order for commission to be acceptable and commission linked to targets that do not consider a consumer&rsquo;s best interests, and soft commission will no longer be permitted</p><p>In conclusion, you should note that I support these changes, which should increase transparency in the commission and inducements arrangements of intermediaries and result in a more level playing field between industry and consumers. </p><p>For further information please see the Central Bank&rsquo;s website which has a press release and further information on the new rules for intermediaries.</p></reply>

The bicycle must be for the employee/director&rsquo;s personal use in undertaking the whole or part of the journey to or from work.  Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  The scheme applies to a pedal cycle, tricycle and a pedelec. A pedelec means a bicycle or tricycle which is equipped with an electric motor (with a maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kilowatts) which cuts out when a speed of 25 kilometres per hour is reached, or sooner if the cyclist stops pedalling the bicycle or tricycle.  </p>  <p>  It is assumed that the reference to &ldquo;cargo bikes&rdquo; by the Deputy means a bicycle specifically designed to carry a load. Such a bicycle would qualify under the cycle to work scheme, assuming all of the required conditions are satisfied. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the cost of a bicycle purchased under the scheme may indeed be more than &euro;1,000, however the exemption from tax does not apply above this limit.</p>  <p>  While schemes of this nature are reviewed in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process I have no plans at present for any increase.</p></reply>

They were brought about to ensure personal data is protected, and to ensure people get access to public services safely, securely and efficiently.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am responsible for ensuring the proper use of resources and the provision of cost-effective public services.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme is a landmark new scheme which will provide financial supports to families for childcare. It establishes an equitable and progressive system of universal and income-related subsidies for children up to the age of 15, and provides an innovative and user-friendly online application process to access those subsidies.</p>  <p>  As part of the online application, there is a requirement to identify individuals in order for them to apply for these childcare subsidies. Government has already invested in MyGovID - a safe, secure and reusable system for online verification of individuals, and it is appropriate that MyGovID be utilised for the delivery of the scheme.</p>  <p>  It does not make sense for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop its own electronic identity system to support its digital services. Building an alternative online identification system for the National Childcare Scheme would mean that Government is spending taxpayers money on two different systems to do the exact same thing, where one reusable, legal and secure alternative exists. The scheme's use of MyGovID is Government acting in a joined up manner.</p>  <p>  I will continue to insist on and drive value for money through the modernisation of how we deliver our public services. Where we already have a suitable, reusable identification system in place for the Public Service, I will not allow taxpayers' money to be directed into the building of redundant infrastructure in this area. Importantly, the money spent on building redundant identity infrastructures, or the money spent on inefficient methods of identification for every public service transaction, is money not spent on the actual end product of the services, which, as I am sure the Deputy will agree, is what people are actually interested in and need.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will use MyGovID to deliver the National Childcare Scheme quicker and cheaper than it would otherwise be in a position to do so if MyGovID were not in existence. A paper based channel, which is more resource intensive and slower to set up, will open shortly afterwards as an alternative route.This is Government striving to deliver the benefits of the scheme to people as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  It will assist the delivery of quality, accessible and affordable childcare that families in Ireland need.</p></reply>

The CFRAM programme culminated with the launch on 3 May 2018 of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans, which proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects, on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes at planning, design or construction within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW). </p>  <p>  The flood relief schemes at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford / Greenore, Baltray and Ardee are in the first tranche of projects to be progressed by Louth County Council:</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;40.54 million, would involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;16.83 million, would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;23.41 million would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a total preliminary cost of &euro;840,000 will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council with full funding from the OPW. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed. </p>  <p>  - There is one proposed scheme initially not included in the first tranche of implementation. The scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth at a projected cost estimate of approximately &euro;1.93 million would involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed. However, the countywide project steering group comprising OPW and local authority representatives, has decided to progress this project simultaneously with Drogheda.</p>  <p>  OPW has also established Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council will be using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project and which will help to speed up the process to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group for flood relief schemes in County Louth has proposed the following prioritisation for progression of first tranche projects for County Louth:</p>  <p>1.  Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee - to be progressed simultaneously.</p>  <p>2.  Drogheda and Baltray - to be progressed simultaneously.</p>  <p>3.  Carlingford/Greenore</p>  <p>  The Steering Group last met on 9 October 2019 where the tender documents for the appointment of consultants for Dundalk/Blackrock South &amp;amp; Ardee were formally signed off. Louth County Council are expected to tender for environmental and design consultants for the Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee Flood Relief Schemes in the coming weeks with a proposed tender return date of January 2020. Work will commence on tender documentation for engineering consultants to progress the Drogheda and Baltray schemes shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the measures set out in the flood risk management plans are not definitive and final, and that as part of the project-level assessment required to prepare the measure for planning/ Public Exhibition, more detailed assessments are required at a local level and further public and stakeholder consultation will be undertaken. As such, there is further scope for the community's views to influence the measures that are progressed to implementation.</p>  <p>  In County Meath, the proposed flood relief scheme at Mornington, with an estimated cost of approximately &euro;530,000, will be progressed directly by Meath County Council with full funding from the OPW. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 51 properties when completed. </p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme. </p></reply>

This section of the Expenditure Report provides a reconciliation between the net voted expenditure amounts in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019 and the White Paper - Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, taking into account estimated Supplementary Estimates and current estimations in relation to additional appropriations-in-aid and underspends. </p>  <p>  The main areas requiring Supplementary Estimates, as detailed in the Expenditure Report, are outlined below. In particular, substantive Supplementary Estimates will be required to deal with emerging expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Justice. </p>  <p>  The overall estimated Supplementary Estimate requirement for Health in 2019 is &euro;335 million. It is estimated that an additional amount of c. &euro;50 million will be required by Education in 2019 to meet projected pay and pension costs and school transport payments. In Justice, It is estimated that an additional amount of just over &euro;50 million will be required to provide for the estimated overrun in Asylum Seekers Accommodation and to meet the additional costs on the Garda Vote arising from the visits of President Trump and Vice-President Pence.</p>  <p>  The policy decision to provide a 100% Christmas Bonus for long-term Social Welfare recipients has a gross cost of c. &euro;279 million. Approximately &euro;125 million of this amount being will be funded from voted expenditure and will necessitate a Supplementary Estimate. However, in terms of the impact on the General Government balance it is anticipated that the cost of the bonus will be fully offset by additional PRSI receipts. At the end of September, PRSI receipts were &euro;0.3 billion ahead of the level estimated in the Revised Estimates for Public Service 2019 and, based on latest assessments, could finish the year approximately &euro;400 million ahead of profile. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Expenditure Report, additional Brexit related expenditure may also give rise to the need for Supplementary Estimates and there will also be a requirement for Supplementary Estimates in certain Departments to meet some one-off costs. </p>  <p>  In line with previous years, it can be expected that there may be a number of technical Supplementary Estimates.</p>  <p>  Work will be ongoing over the coming weeks to finalise details in relation to all necessary substantive and technical Supplementary Estimates before their presentation to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-15a.369.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101500064#WRG00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</p>  <p>  I published the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 last month and it completed Second Stage in the Seanad on 2 October. </p>  <p>  The overall aim of the legislation is to improve the level of engagement between schools and students and their parents by inviting feedback, comment and observations from students and parents and by developing a listening culture in the school.  Under the legislation each school is required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners. </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Circular 0038/2018, which issued to all schools last year, requires schools to consult with teachers, student and parents in the development of policy around the use of digital devices in school. This consultation requirement will be underpinned in law once the Parents and Students Charter Bill is enacted.  </p>  <p>  It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms and how to manage their integration into classroom practice based on their own particular context and needs.</p>  <p>  While recognising the potential benefits associated with the use of digital technology, to enhance teaching and learning, as set out in the Digital Strategy for Schools, it is also very important that we continue to work together to raise awareness to the risks and provide support to teachers, students and parents in developing their awareness to combat any risks associated with the use of the internet.</p>  <p>  The Digital Learning Framework, which is in its second year of dissemination to schools, provides clarity for school leaders and education providers on how to create a shared vision for the effective use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. The dissemination of the Framework is accompanied by an extensive CPD programme provided by my Department&rsquo;s teacher support service, the PDST. This includes guidance for schools on how to develop a digital learning plan and complements School Self Evaluation planning processes. </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education team offers advice to schools on the use of digital technology in education with wide range of information available on its website on the use of devices and offers  support to schools on teaching, learning and assessment, to facilitate students' active learning and collaboration. Specific items for consideration including software and hardware requirements, purchasing regulations, are addressed in this support information.</p>  <p>  As regards online safety, there are extensive training and curricular supports available, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum and the Framework for Junior Cycle and the Webwise Programme to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and to promote students&rsquo; mental, emotional, social and physical wellbeing.  This includes supports on the development of an Accepted Usage Policy (AUP) in schools and on prevention of bullying and harassment using the internet. The Webwise Team have developed (and consistently update) a Teachers Hub; A Parents Hub and a Youth Hub which includes resources to tackle issues such as cyberbullying, image sharing and online coercion and extortion. Its most recent resource HTLM Heroes is targeted at primary school children and was developed to assist and support educators when teaching students about the safe and responsible uses of the internet. HTML Heroes will be taught as part of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying in schools. These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed. As part of the implementation of the Action Plan the National Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary school, were published and are being implemented by all primary and post primary schools in the country. Under the procedures the prevention of bullying must be an integral part of the written anti-bullying policy of every school and must outline the specific education and prevention strategies to be implemented by the school.  This must include documenting the measures being taken by the school to explicitly address the issues of cyber-bullying as well as other explicit forms of bullying.</p>  <p>  Arising from the Action Plan my Department also funds a number of awareness raising initiatives, including the provision of anti-bullying training for parents to enable them to assist their children when issues of bullying arise.  Funding is also provided to the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) to carry out research into all forms of bullying and towards the ongoing maintenance and development of the national anti-bullying website www.tacklebullying.ie, which provides a single point of information and support for young people, parents and teachers affected by bullying. </p>  <p>  The PDST has a dedicated Health and Wellbeing team comprising 22 full time personnel. This team supports teachers and schools, through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum to develop and promote the personal development, health and wellbeing of the student; to create a positive school environment and culture; and to prevent and tackle bullying including online bullying and harassment.    </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Online Safety Hub, a single online access point www.gov.ie/besafeonline provides links to a wide range of online safety resources and information for parents, teachers, young people and the general population from the six key Government Departments responsible for the implementation of the Government's Action Plan on Online Safety.</p></reply>

The preparation of new legislation to reflect the current higher education and higher education research system in Ireland and Government policy for the sector is also under way, with additional stakeholder consultation due in the near future. </p>  <p>  Most recently, and building on progress in previous budgets, Budget 2020 provided for a &euro;153 million increase in funding for Tertiary Education.  Including a multi-annual programme of &euro;90 million for Technological Universities and a new initiative to promote Research Excellence.  This brings total spend on the HE sector to &euro;1.88bn, the highest level to date of spend on higher education in a single year and delivering an increase of 25% over the past four years. </p></reply>

On receipt of this plan the HEA will be required to assess it and engage further with the Institute, if necessary, to secure further measures in the plan.  I will be advised of the assessment by the HEA and, subject to a positive assessment and an endorsement by HEA of the plan, I propose to initiate a working group to consider the requirement for additional funding support to respond to the systemic structural challenges of the Institute.  These challenges arise from, for example, the Institute&rsquo;s small size, peripheral location, the demographic profile of its catchment area and the high level of competition it experiences from other HEIs in the region.  The MTU Working Group will be composed of all key stakeholders and consistent with the similar approaches adopted previously for other institutions that have experienced financial difficulty.  A major element of the work of this group will be to assess how the potential transition to a TU provides opportunities to significantly strengthen the profile and offering in Tralee.  </p>  <p>  As manifested in the high-level of financial support provided to date to IT Tralee, the Government is committed to the continued provision of higher education in Kerry and more widely in the South &ndash;West region.  In that context, there is no question that the actions to secure a resolution to the financial difficulties in IT Tralee would be expected to give rise to creation of a potential financial burden that would have the effect of undermining the financial stability, sustainability and development of the potential MTU.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The question of a mechanism raised by the Deputy does not therefore arise. </p></reply>

The report specifically recommended utilising the NTF to support investment in Higher Education.</p>  <p>  The targeted support of these key skill areas from the NTF has facilitated broader investment in higher education from the Department of Education and Skills so that since 2017, a re-distribution of funding between the NTF and Exchequer in tandem with the levy increases has been implemented on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  In 2020, &euro;28.2 million of previously exchequer funded enterprise focussed higher education programmes will now be funded by the NTF which will allow the exchequer to invest additonal resources in key initiatives in higher education such as the technological universities transformation fund and higher education research excellence.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there has been a continuing increase in investment in higher education funded by the Exchequer over recent years, including a &euro;60m increase in in current funding to provide for increased student number over the three year period 2018-2020.</p></reply>

This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level and Budget 2019 which provided over 1300 additional posts in schools.</p>  <p>  The number of teachers has increased from 63,556 in 2015/16 to almost 71,000 in 2019/20, an increase of over 7,300 teaching posts.  At the end of 2019, there will be up to 15,950 SNAs working in our schools, an increase of over 51% since 2011.  </p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level and 13.8:1 to 13:1 at post primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  It is expected that these ratios will further improve when the statistics for the 2019/20 school year are published.</p></reply>

This compares to 60 such special classes in 2011/12. In the period 2011 to 2019, the number of SSLD special classes has ranged from 60 - 65, depending on need.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education is an independent statutory body, whose functions include planning and coordinating the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs in conjunction with schools and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This includes responsibility, through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SNEOs) for establishing special classes.  Applications meeting the criteria for establishment of special classes, including Specific Speech and Language special slasses are approved by the NCSE.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new classes or retain current classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open/retain classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision, and they must also be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.</p>  <p>  There are currently three SSLD special classes in Tipperary, two in Clonmel and one in Nenagh. As the Deputy's question refers to the provision of further SSLD classes in this area, it has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2019. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p>  <p>  The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the relevant awarding authority shall establish:</p>  <p>  - the method for measuring a route; and</p>  <p>  - the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p>  <p>  SUSI has progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures is the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants. </p>  <p>  However, the actual calculation of distance from a student's home to college has not changed from previous years, and SUSI continues to use google maps to calculate distance.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of students who have moved from the non-adjacent to the adjacent rate in 2019/20, there can be a number of reasons why a student may move from one grant rate to another. These include: students returning from studying abroad e.g. for work placement or Erasmus; change of college or campus; permanent change of normal address etc. For the 2019/20 academic year SUSI has advised that to date, 210 renewal students have moved from non-adjacent to adjacent. SUSI has also advised that to date, 170 students have moved from adjacent to non-adjacent </p>  <p>  If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within  a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including the following new primary schools to be established in the areas referred to by the Deputy:</p><p>- A new 8-classroom primary school to serve the Swords school planning area (South) to be established in 2019; </p><p>- A new 8-classroom primary school to serve the Swords school planning area (North) to be established in 2019, which will now open in 2020.</p><p>- A new 16-classroom primary school to serve the Donabate school planning area to be established in 2020.</p><p>In addition, the following new post-primary schools were also established in the areas referred to by the Deputy in recent years:</p><p>- A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2013 to serve the Rush &amp;amp; Lusk school planning area;</p><p>- A new 700 pupil post-primary school established in 2014 to serve the Balbriggan school planning area;</p><p>- A new 700 pupil post-primary school established in 2016 to serve the Balbriggan school planning area;</p><p>- A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2018 to serve the Malahide and Portmarnock school planning areas as a regional solution; and</p><p>- A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2018 to serve the Swords school planning area.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. </p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Over 1,300 additional posts in schools have been funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has provided for a budget of more than &euro;11 billion for the Department of Education and Skills in 2020. This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of nearly &euro;2 billion since 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Budget 2020 measure of improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four teachers or less will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Board of Management which selection criteria are included in their enrolment policy and in what priority these criteria are applied. The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>However, if the parents in question are in a position that they cannot secure any place for their child they may wish to call the Education Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) which is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

Over 1,300 additional posts in schools have been funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.   </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has provided for a budget of more than &euro;11 billion for the Department of Education and Skills in 2020. This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of nearly &euro;2 billion since 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Budget 2020 measure of improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four teachers or less will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  Should the parents of the child, the subject of the Deputy's question, have specific concerns about his educational progress they should, in the first instance, speak to the Principal of the school concerned, with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist for the appropriate individual intervention.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To ensure compliance with these requirements, as grantor, my Department must ensure that it has an effective grant-funding supervision regime in place for all of the grants it administers to inform evidence based decision making and to ensure it achieves best value for money in the use of public moneys. </p>  <p>  For over 20 years my Department, has provided funding to this organisation towards the day to day expenses of the community based drug rehabilitation project.  The grant allocation is approved on an annual basis with the conditions of funding set out in the annual allocation letter which includes full compliance with the provisions of Circular 13/2014.  In line with its obligations as grantor, my Department  carried out a review of funding of the project in 2011 and has since then provided over &euro;1.2 million in funding for the project. </p>  <p>  In correspondence to the organisation in August this year, my Department advised that it was planning a review of funding of the project.  Review of the grant to this organisation, which commenced last month, is one of a number of grants under similar review.  The organisation has been advised that they will be kept informed on progress throughout the review. The findings and recommendations from the review, which will take into account the impact of its recommendations on service users, will be conveyed to the organisation in due course.</p></reply>

This includes some &euro;8.8 billion for the schools sector and &euro;2.2 billion for higher education infrastructure.

In 2019 the allocation was &euro;622m. The allocation envisaged for 2020 is &euro;620m. The allocation for schools will support circa 60 new school building projects going to construction in 2020 delivering in excess of 30,000 school places (permanent additional and replacement places).  This is in addition to in excess of 40 existing projects which are currently in construction and being progressed through 2020 delivering up to 25,000 school places.  </p>  <p>  This allocation will also include a provision for a Summer Works Scheme, details of which will be announced later in 2019 </p>  <p>  In addition, the Minor Works Grant is due to be paid to all primary schools either in December or at the latest early January 2020.  </p>  <p>  Finally, demographics at primary level have increased over the last decade but have now peaked and are starting to reduce.

This will facilitate parents in spending more time with their children in their critical first year of life.  The Bill gives the Minister power to increase the leave to a maximum of nine weeks and there is already a commitment to increasing both leave and benefit to seven weeks for each parent by 2021.  </p>  <p>  Any retrospective date for entitlement to parent&rsquo;s leave and benefit would amount to backdating the scheme. This would have the effect of creating a backlog of applications immediately on the introduction of the scheme and would have considerable unforeseen cost implications.  Depending on the extent of backdating, this provision could also have the effect of extending parent&rsquo;s leave beyond the first year after birth or adoption.  With all of this in mind, the selection of I November 2019 as the date on which entitlement to parent&rsquo;s leave and benefit will arise is considered the optimal choice for launching this important new initiative.  </p></reply>

Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The unprecedented funding of &euro;1.882 billion provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Budget 2020 will allow for the recruitment of up to 700 new Garda&iacute; and additional Garda staff next year. The appropriate balance between Garda&iacute; and Garda staff will be for the Garda Commissioner to determine, on the basis of operational need. The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service nationwide.</p></reply>

I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year in addition to &euro;116million in capital investment.  This level of funding will allow the Garda Commissioner to recruit up to 700 new Garda&iacute; next year and additional Garda staff. </p>  <p>  I am confident that this ongoing investment in Garda resources together with the ongoing reform process will result in an improved policing service for all communities, urban and rural, now and into the future.</p></reply>

That separate research project is well underway. This research will be completed in Q4 of this year and the results will help develop new approaches to ensure hate crime is addressed effectively in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Taken together, this work will significantly advance our understanding of what is needed to ensure that legislation in this important area protects and supports those who are targeted by expressions and acts of hatred. </p>  <p>  There is widespread public interest in reforming our approach to hate crime in this jurisdiction and this is something I welcome.  I will consider the outcomes of all of the exercises which are now taking place in my Department on this subject, and will draw on this evidence to bring forward the necessary proposals for change.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that where a crime is identified as having hate as a motivation, this may be taken into account by the Court as an aggravating factor, thereby increasing the sentence imposed. </p></reply>

For example, final Garda reports on the relevant crime are required, as are the outcomes of any cases initiated.  In addition, in some cases the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years.  Further, the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports. These and other factors can have an impact on the time required in relation to any particular application. </p></reply>

The person concerned in the Deputy's query should apply for a Join Family visa, if the purpose of their journey is to reside in Ireland with their Irish citizen spouse.  </p>  <p>  The Immigration Service website (www.inis.gov.ie) contains comprehensive guidelines to assist the applicant with the application process.  The information available includes the Policy Document for Non-EEA Family Reunification which sets out the general considerations for such applications.  It should, however, be noted that the information contained on the website is intended to provide guidance only and does not limit the discretion of the Visa Officer in dealing with individual applications. The onus rests at all times with the applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer that any visa sought should be granted. </p>  <p>  I am advised that Join Family applications, where the sponsor is an Irish national, will typically be dealt with within 6 months of receipt of all the required documentation, as set out in the Policy Document.  This is a business target which reflects the detailed assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.  It does not constitute a legal obligation and applications may take longer due to the individual circumstances or complexity of the application. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the Immigration Service is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.  </p>  <p>  In addition, applicants may themselves e-mail queries directly to the Immigration Service (visamail@justice.ie).</p></reply>

Under this programme, the Government committed to accept up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the Relocation Programme established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement Programme, currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon and Jordan.</p>  <p>  The Government Decision to accept 4,000 people into the State did not specify a time-limit, but the EU Relocation Programme had a time limit of approximately two years. Ireland&rsquo;s EU Relocation Programme concluded in March 2018. Overall, 1,022 people, including 6 unaccompanied minors, arrived here from Greece. </p>  <p>  Under the Resettlement strand of the programme, Ireland committed to accept 1,040 programme refugees by the end of 2017.  Approximately 255 of this group formed part of the 2018/2019 pledge to the EU, as it was not possible to resettle these refugees in 2017. The Government pledged to take 1,200 programme refugees from Lebanon between 2018 (255 as per above plus 345) and 2019 (600), bringing the total Resettlement commitment under the IRPP to 1,985.  To date, 1,418 people have arrived under the Resettlement strand of the programme. Further arrivals are planned between now and the end of the year to admit the balance of the 1,985 people to be resettled.</p>  <p>  So far, 2,115 people who arrived under the IRPP have been resettled in communities across Ireland. This represents more than 86% of the 2,440 arrivals so far under the Relocation and Resettlement strands of the programme.</p></reply>

I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to two separate operations- one in relation to anti-social behaviour in the Temple Bar area and one in relation to rail safety. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Pier commenced in 2015 in the DMR South Central Division and has a personnel strength of one Sergeant and 20 Garda&iacute;.  The purpose of this operation is to target anti-social behaviour and street level drug dealing in the Temple bar and adjoining areas.  I am informed that Garda members attached to this unit are an integral part of the community and respond to all complaints from the residents and businesses in the area. The unit also undertakes dedicated operations in regard to organised and aggressive begging, as well as the operation of Rickshaws that are suspect of drug dealing.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this Operation and its members have been acknowledged by the local business community for their effectiveness and high visibility policing. I am advised that as at 15 October 2019 there have been in excess of 1,947 arrests by the Garda&iacute; attached to Operation Pier.</p>  <p>  In relation to rail safety, I am advised by Garda management that it engages extensively with transport operators and that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to address incidents and issues that have arisen at specific locations.

The scheme leverages &euro;23 million exchequer funding to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over its lifetime. </p><p>Under the first stage of the scheme&rsquo;s application process, businesses apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p><p>The scheme is offered by the Government of Ireland through my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is operated by the SBCI. It is supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group&rsquo;s InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility. In order to qualify for eligibility under the scheme, businesses need only satisfy one of eleven InnovFin criteria. These criteria are established under the InnovFin facility itself, and were not put in place by Government. </p><p>However, the innovation activities supported by the scheme are not limited to technological innovation. Rather, recognised innovations are relatively broad ranging and supported activities include development of new products/services and entry to new markets, as well as changes to production methods and supply chains. The hurdle rate as to whether an activity is innovative is not onerous, and, as at 25 September 2019, just 15 applicants to the scheme have failed to meet the innovation criterion. I am aware that many firms that may met the eligibility criteria and have received approval from SBCI have not yet proceeded to sanction with their bank, and as the SBCI approval previously was valid for only four months, I have agreed with SBCI that they will extend the validity period for their eligibility to six months so as to reduce the administrative requirement on firms to reapply. </p><p>Full information on the innovation criteria is available through the Brexit Loan Scheme Information Pack, available through my Department&rsquo;s website. Some case studies illustrating what qualifies as innovation are included in the information pack. I have also attached a copy to this response.</p></reply>

These measures will be rolled out as part of the initial &euro;110m Brexit contingency fund that will be available to my Department as part of the Government's &euro;650m Brexit contingency Fund announced by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform last week in Budget 2020. This funding and other measures are being deployed based on our ongoing engagement with the European Commission on the State aid framework and my Department continues to explore, through the Irish/EU State aid Technical Group, all opportunities within existing State aid rules. </p>  <p>  Much has been achieved by this Group to date including the Brexit Loan Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, the expansion of the Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary Restructuring Aid and the subsequent increase in state aid flexibilities in relation to these Schemes.  Through the Working Group, approval was received, for example, to provide support to Carbery Food Ingredients towards financing a large diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit and further options, through the Agriculture state aid Guidelines, are being developed to support large food companies.  The work of this Group is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Technical Working Group discussions.  I have received assurances from Commissioner Vestager, Commissioner for Competition, that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts on Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  In relation to the potential for introducing an employment subsidy scheme, while this is primarily a matter for my Ministerial colleagues, in the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Education and Skills, I know that the existing system of systematic short-time working arrangements remains in place and are being utilised by the Intreo offices countrywide. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a group comprising officials from those Departments and my own Department continue to meet and are examining policy options in this space in event of a hard Brexit and an early-warning coordination process has been established for firms experiencing difficulty.  Intreo offices (under the auspices of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection) stand ready to work with employers experiencing short term difficulties in all sectors, with the objective of keeping workers close to the labour market as viable firms adjust. In addition, there has been strong engagement between relevant Departments regarding responses for the tourism/hospitality and freight sectors.  </p>  <p>   The suite of additional supports for business announced in the Budget of up to &euro;110 million for a combination of lending and repayable grants to be available for deployment in a No Deal scenario are all designed as targeted and temporary, supporting viable but vulnerable businesses and with built in assurances to safeguard the State&rsquo;s investment. These supports will be critical particularly in the highly vulnerable border areas and in supporting exporters who are heavily exposed to the UK market in sectors such as construction, engineering and food.</p>  <p>  The introduction of an enterprise stabilisation fund in 2009 required a significant change to State Aid rules, which was subject to the approval of all 28 Member States. In accordance with EU rules, it was also required that the fund be made available to all Member States. However, following a review of the approach in 2009 it was subsequently found that the greater benefits accrued to the larger EU economies.</p></reply>

The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment at competitive rates with minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) and maximum loan amount of &euro;3,000,000.  Loans of under &euro;500,000 are being made on an unsecured basis.</p>  <p>  This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.  This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment.  </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget 2020 speech on Tuesday, 8th October 2019, announced a contingency fund of &euro;650m, across a number of Government Departments, in the event of a no deal Brexit.  On day one of a no deal Brexit, &euro;110m will be made available to my Department for the following: </p>  <p> - &euro;42m for Rescue and Restructuring</p>  <p> - &euro;45m for a new Transition Fund  </p>  <p> - &euro;8m Transformation Fund for Food and Non Food businesses  </p>  <p> - &euro;5m additional support to Microfinance Ireland, and </p>  <p> - &euro;5m Micro-Enterprise Emergency Brexit Fund.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I will provide &euro;2m extra to InterTrade Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit to support cross-border firms North and South and an extra &euro;3m to Regulatory Bodies of my Department for additional demands in market surveillance, accreditation and conformity.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to the funding available under the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme and the full range of grant supports available to firms through Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices to prepare now for Brexit through improving their competitiveness and innovation and diversifying markets.</p>  <p>  In terms of State Aid, my Department has been working closely with the EU Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish-EU Technical Working Group on State Aid.  The Group comprises representatives from DG Comp, my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland.  The objective of the Group has been to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  This includes exploring all opportunities under EU Regulation No. 1407/2013 (de Minimis Regulation).</p>  <p>  Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.  Options available through the Agriculture Guidelines are also being developed to support large food companies. </p>  <p>  State Aid approval was received in February for capital investment by Enterprise Ireland in an Irish cheese producing company, Carbery Food Ingredients Ltd, to help the company towards financing a &euro;65m diversification project to mitigate the impacts of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  On 24th January 2019, I met with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The meeting focused on the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face as a result of Brexit and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State Aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the firm-level implications of Brexit become known.  The Commissioner has emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms, and my officials continue to work with DG Competition, as part of the Technical Working Group.</p></reply>

My Department, through the LEOs, has continued to promote the importance of local businesses preparing for Brexit, and has developed a range of supports to help them do so. The LEOs are working vigorously to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.</p><p>LEO clients based in the Drogheda area can access LEO grants and supports in the same manner and subject to the same decision criteria as applicants in the rest of the county. This applies equally to clients for East Meath relative to other areas of County Meath. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that LEO Louth is deeply committed to ensuring they grow a strong spirit of enterprise in Drogheda, and that businesses there are supported fully and on the same basis as firms throughout Louth and the rest of the country. Notwithstanding that the offices of LEO Louth are located in the County Council Offices in Dundalk, the full range of programmes and activities that it delivers are dispersed evenly throughout the county. Similarly, LEO Meath provides the same offerings throughout the County including the Laytown/Bettystown Municipal District having numerous mentor assignments and training programmes for LEO clients based in East Meath. </p><p>Furthermore, I was pleased to announce as part of Budget 2020 that in the event of a hard Brexit I will launch a number of new Brexit supports to further strengthen the capacity of our microenterprise sector. Specifically, I announced two related measures to support vulnerable but viable business in the face of Brexit by way of increasing the cap on lending from MicroFinance Ireland to &euro;50,000 and the provision of repayable grants through the Local Enterprise Offices. </p><p>In addition, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2020 improvements to the Research and Development Tax credit for small and micro firms, which will enable them to claim a higher rate of credit of 30% and they will have improved options with regards to claiming the payable credit. These firms will also be able to claim the credit for expenditure incurred in advance of commencing to trade</p><p>This improved support should be considered in the context of existing LEO supports which include the following. </p><p><b>-  The Brexit Mentor Programme</b>was developed for businesses to work with an experienced mentor on a one-to-one basis to identify key areas of exposure within their business.  With advice and guidance from their mentor, businesses develop strategies that are more robust, which address issues and maximise potential opportunities around Brexit. </p><p><b>-  Prepare Your Business for Customs</b>is a one-day interactive workshop, run regionally by Local Enterprise Offices, which provides businesses with a better understanding of the potential impacts, formalities and procedures to be adopted when trading with a country which is outside the Single Market and Custom Unions. Open to all businesses, these workshops cover areas such as what export and import procedures apply, how tariffs work and how to correctly classify goods. </p><p><b>-  LEAN for Micro</b>is a targeted programme for Local Enterprise Office clients to help small businesses boost competitiveness, increase performance and profitability as well as building resilience within their companies.</p><p><b>-  The Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME)</b>Grant supports clients to explore and develop new export market opportunities, such as participation in international trade fairs and development of export related marketing and websites. With a focus on helping companies to diversify, this scheme is a match-funding opportunity with up to &euro;2,500 available.</p><p>I note that you have enquired about funding for a new LEO to cover the Drogheda and East Meath region. You will be aware that when the LEO network was established in 2014, there was a LEO in each of the 31 Local Authorities and this has been the model used ever since. This model, in operation for over 5 years, has been the platform for ongoing and incremental success in terms of engagement with client companies and strong jobs growth. I am pleased to say that in general there has been strong and meaningful engagement throughout 2019 from the microenterprise sector with the LEO network and in particular the LEO Brexit offering. </p><p>I am confident therefore that in the days and weeks ahead, the LEO network will continue its robust and meaningful engagement with its many clients and will remain an integral component in this Government&rsquo;s toolkit to prepare our microenterprise sector to face any challenge that comes its way as a result of Brexit, whatever form that may take.</p></reply>

There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department. </p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 01 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments. The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump sum and the  monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs,  equipment, housing adaptations, and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services. There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors in relation to meeting their ongoing health and personal social service needs.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation, has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide on a statutory basis for health and personal social services for the Irish survivors of thalidomide. </p></reply>

The capital plan outlines projects to be progressed over the three-year period and also sets out the current status of all projects within the programme, including a number of projects in Co. Louth.</p><p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects and has advised the current stage of development of the projects as follows:</p><p>- Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda: construction has been completed and is currently at the equipping and commissioning stage. Some of the wards and the ED are already operational while the five new theatres and remaining wards are expected to be completed by the end of 2019. </p><p>- St Mary's Hospital, Drogheda: the phased development is at planning and design stage. A planning application was submitted to Louth County Council earlier this year. Further information was requested by the local authority and this has recently been submitted by the HSE. </p><p>- Ardee Community Nursing Unit: to be delivered as part of a bundle of facilities by Public Private Partnership (PPP). A design team has been appointed and a planning application has recently been lodged in respect of this project. </p><p>- Ardee ambulance base: currently at design stage.  </p><p>It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p><p>The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.</p><p>The HSE actively manages the capital programme in order to ensure it has flexibility to progress as many projects as possible within the available funding, particularly in the event of any project not progressing as anticipated.</p></reply>

There are 10 Supported Care Homes in Community Healthcare Organisation Area 5 providing accommodation and support services to older people with low to medium dependency levels.  The residents cannot be maintained independently at home, but do not yet require nursing home care.  </p>  <p>  The HSE acknowledges the role played by these Homes in reducing possible admission to nursing homes and I have been assured by the HSE that it is committed to ensuring Supported Care Home are supported. The HSE will provide about &euro;2.5 million in Section 39 funding this year towards the operational costs of the Homes.  </p>  <p>  HIQA is the independent statutory body established to register and inspect all residential homes for older people. The current regulatory regime aims to ensure the provision of high-quality, safe and effective services to people living in these centres, whether they are nursing homes providing 24-hour nursing care or supported care homes for people with lower dependencies.</p>  <p>  As people get older, their housing needs may change.  Earlier this year the Government published a Policy Statement &ldquo;Housing Options for our Ageing Population&rdquo; which provides a policy framework to support our ageing population through increasing the accommodation options available to them and give them meaningful choice in how and where they choose to live. It also sets out a package of key actions to assist the development of models of supported housing that promote integration between housing and health and social care services.    </p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental and Inter-Agency Implementation Groups has been established to progress the programme of actions contained in the policy statement. This will assist in developing a menu of solutions which are available nationally to provide enhanced housing and support options for older people.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the Implementation Groups and the implementation of the policy statement are key actions in the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan. Many of the health related action points are influenced by and integrated with broader Sl&aacute;intecare actions.</p>  <p>   The level of funding available to supported care homes is being considered in the context of the HSE's National Service Plan for 2020.</p></reply>

The monthly waiting list figures are published on the NTPF website, and a breakdown of the Inpatient/Day Case waiting list by Adult &amp;amp; Child Analysis is published by hospital.</p><p>Outpatient waiting list information has been collected and published by the NTPF since 2013. The data represents those waiting for a first appointment at a consultant-led Outpatient clinic. The Outpatient Waiting List report shows the total number of patients waiting, across the various time bands, for a first appointment at a consultant-led Outpatient clinic. The analysis by Adult and Child is not currently published for the outpatient waiting list in a pdf format, however a breakdown by specialty by hospital/ hospital group/and by age profile is available on the NTPF website in an open source format. The NTPF has advised my Department that they are working towards publishing the outpatients waiting list by Adult &amp;amp; Child Analysis in a pdf format in the coming months.</p><p>The HSE Management Data Report (MDR) reports on HSE activity against Key Performance Indicators as set out in the National Service Plan for 2019. Under the National Service Plan 2019, the target for all hospital groups is for 80% of people, including children, to wait less than 52 weeks for a first Outpatient Department appointment.</p><p>The last published MDR figures are for June 2019 and report that 68.9% of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment across all hospitals are waiting 52 weeks or less, while 60% of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment at CHI hospitals are waiting 52 weeks or less.</p><p>CHI has advised that it is committed to reducing waiting lists and supporting initiatives that ensure that children receive care appropriately and in a timely manner, and in 2019 a number of initiatives were put in place to address Outpatient Waiting Lists.</p><p>For example, the new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre in CHI at Connolly opened on 31<sup>st</sup>July 2019. This new facility offers a range of services to children and their families in the local area as well as those in Dublin North city and county and the surrounding areas in Kildare and Meath. General Paediatric Clinics are held from 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday. CHI has advised that the opening of CHI at Connolly is having a positive impact on CHI OPD waiting lists. At the end of September 2019, there were 4,130 patients on CHI&rsquo;s General Paediatric Outpatient waiting list, which is a 35% reduction when compared to the same period last year.</p><p>Furthermore, CHI at Connolly will provide a further 1,300 outpatient appointments between September and December 2019. CHI advise that they are currently in the process of expanding these clinics to provide a focus on the specific requirements for some patients including asthma, allergy, faltering growth and constipation. When fully operational, CHI at Connolly is expected to provide 17,000 outpatient appointments (General Paediatrics and Orthopaedic clinics) every year  <b>. </b></p><p>Management of referrals is a key enabler to reducing waiting lists, and in this regard CHI advise that they have initiated a referrals process whereby all referrals from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals are managed centrally. The group is progressing its ICT requirements to have a single Patient Administration System across all CHI sites (the three children&rsquo;s hospitals and CHI at Connolly). </p><p>The central referrals team, through administrative and clinical validation are ensuring that all appointment slots are used appropriately and that where appropriate, patients who do not need hospital care, are removed from the waiting list, which is assisting in the waiting list reduction.</p><p>Another example of innovation in referral pathways is the TORC project (Triage of Referral Clinics). This is one of a number of virtual clinics currently being held across CHI and involves the active triage of referrals, the provision of advice and commencement of treatment for patients. As a result, patients may then either not have to attend an outpatient clinic appointment or can begin their pathway of care prior to attendance. CHI advise that this has been very successful in achieving a discharge rate of up to 30% of patients contacted. In addition, patients can begin their diagnostics prior to attending an appointment which ensures the best use of resources and reduction in follow-up attendances for patients and their families. </p><p>CHI is continuing with a number of other initiatives including moving Dermatology referrals towards a more centralised structure together with a virtual clinic model in this specialty. </p><p>CHI continues to engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to secure funding for initiatives in 2019 to address access to patients for specialties including ENT, Ophthalmology, General Paediatrics, Orthopaedics and Gastroenterology. </p><p>CHI advises that recruitment of additional consultants for CHI specialties with the longest OPD waiting times (Allergy, Dermatology, Radiology, Gastroenterology, Rheumatology, Orthopaedics &amp;amp; ENT) is also underway following CHI securing additional National Service Plan funding in 2019.

A network of 11 clinical nurse co-ordinators is in place, with responsibility for ensuring that children being cared for at home by their families have access to co-ordinated and supportive services. A second consultant took up a position at Temple Street Children's Hospital in February 2019.

It met for the first time on 26th September 2019 and is being led by the Secretary General of the Department of Health Jim Breslin and Peggy Maguire, the Director General of the European Institute for Women&rsquo;s Health, in partnership with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland. The new Taskforce will take a comprehensive approach to women's health and will tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland. The first action of the Taskforce will be a large-scale listening exercise with women in Ireland to hear their experiences of and solutions for the health system.  This will be a significant, substantial and large-scale consultation. Data from this process, combined with the available evidence on women's health, will determine the work programme for the Taskforce.</p><p>For more information including opportunities to engage with the Taskforce see  </p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that the LTI Scheme will be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

In some instances GP practices have a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients.  If this happens, patients should contact other GP practices in their area. While I have no role in relation to such matters, I would expect clinicians to consider the importance of patients having access to a GP service close to home when deciding whether or not to accept private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing GP capacity to ensure that all patients, those that hold a medical or GP visit card as well as those that do not, continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future. </p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday. Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have also been introduced.</p>  <p>  There has also been a significant expansion in the number of places on GP training programmes in recent years; up from 120 places in 2009 to 192 filled in 2019.</p>  <p>  An agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on contractual reform was concluded this year. In return for cooperation with a wide range of service developments and reforms, the Government will increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (or &euro;210 million) by 2023. This will see significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease management programme.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors, thus increasing GP capacity and helping to ensure that all patients have access to GP services.</p></reply>

It is a type of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma &ndash; a cancer of the immune system.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been updating my Department on this matter as further research is published and as evidence continues to emerge at both a European and international level and while the risk of developing BIA-ALCL has been shown to be more common than first thought, it still remains a rare condition. </p>  <p>  Breast implant devices and tissue expanders can have various types of surface texturing and the risk of developing BIA ALCL appears to be related to the degree of surface texturing on the breast implant or tissue expander.  Other breast implants may have a different risk of developing BIA-ALCL. Implants with a lesser degree of surface texturing appear to have a less common association with BIA-ALCL.  A range of breast implants with different degrees of surface texturing have been used in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has decided to communicate publicly on this matter at this time in order to increase awareness of BIA ALCL, ensure that women in Ireland are fully informed on this issue and are given the appropriate advice. My Department has been working alongside the HSE in this regard. </p>  <p>  On October 9 2019, the HSE published an information notice on their website in relation to this matter. This notice provides further background on BIA ALCL including its relationship with textured breast implants and tissue expanders, signs and symptoms to be aware of, when to seek medical attention and further advice to women who may be affected by this issue. </p>  <p>  The HSE will issue letters to people who have received textured breast implants or tissue expanders during surgery in Ireland. These letters will have advice on what the individuals should do if they are concerned. The issuing of these letters by the HSE is due to commence in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The details referred to in the question relate to an article that appeared in the Irish Independent on October 5, headed &ldquo;Probe over cancer link to breast implants&rdquo;. The article wrongly referred to 14 reports of &ldquo;potential breast cancer illness&rdquo; related to breast implants having been reported to the Health Products Regulatory Authority. The paper in question subsequently issued a correction, clarifying that the Health Products Regulatory Authority had advised that it had received 14 complaints of breast implant illness. This condition is not related to cancer. Breast implant illness can include joint pain, rashes, memory loss, brain fog and other symptoms. The errors were initially corrected on the online version of the paper and a print correction was published on October 7. </p>  <p>  Regarding the number of cases of BIA ALCL identified in Ireland, where there may be a small number of cases only and due to the possible risk of patient identification, I cannot confirm a specific number of cases. </p></reply>

This is made up of the &euro;20 million continuing cost in 2019 of developments initiated in 2018, combined with &euro;35 million for further new developments. Since 2012, the Mental Health HSE Budget has been increased by almost 40%.</p>  <p>  This investment has enabled the HSE Mental Health Services to progress initiatives outlined in the National Service Plan 2019. Initiatives such as e-mental health pilot programmes and Clinical Programmes in areas such as Eating Disorders and ADHD continue to be developed and implemented with this funding. Funding is also provided in 2019 to plan for the opening of the new National Forensic Mental Hospital. </p>  <p>  To date, the HSE has drawn down &euro;30 million of the foregoing funding, and an application for a further &euro;10 million is currently being processed. In addition, &euro;3 million has been paid to Pobal for the Community Mental Health Fund.</p>  <p>  I will be meeting the HSE in the next few days to agree the management of the remaining &euro;12m funding for 2019. </p>  <p>  Mental health continues to be a priority area for the Government.

That is why, following on from the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment, I established a Working Group within my Department to examine the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues arising in relation to improving access to contraception.</p><p>Since its establishment at the end of April, the Group has overseen a public consultation exercise, undertaken a review of research and met directly with a number of stakeholders.  The Group has recently finalised its report and has submitted it for my consideration. </p><p>I intend to fully consider the detail of the report.  We do, however, know that there can be barriers to accessing contraception, and that for some people cost is an issue.  Most forms of contraception, including Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives, are provided free of charge to those with medical cards, while the National Condom Distribution Service also supports free access to contraception among those that may be at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes.  </p><p>The Working Group examined other means by which the costs involved in accessing contraception can be reduced, and its recommendations in this regard will be of particular interest.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge that there can be barriers to contraception aside from cost, such as difficulty accessing services in a particular locality or feelings of embarrassment.For example, in the United Kingdom, where contraceptive products and services are available free at the point of service, recent research shows that a high proportion of pregnancies are still deemed unwanted or unintended.</p><p>Clearly, this is a complex and multi-faceted issue, and I look forward to examining the report of the Working Group in more detail.</p></reply>

The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on the 11th June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The Department will progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme has been sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department will participate in pre-legislative scrutiny when the Committee sets a date in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p></reply>

Furthermore, many of the newer products being licenced are falling well short of cost-effectiveness thresholds, with limited clinical benefits.  </p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system.    </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  The legislative underpinning of the Health Act is backed up by the Framework Agreement on the Supply of Medicines 2016-2020 signed between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA).  It is expected to deliver approximately &euro;600 million in savings from IPHA companies over the four-year lifetime of the Agreement and &euro;150 million in savings from non-IPHA companies. This Agreement contains a number of measures intended to increase sustainable drug access and supply.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the IPHA Agreement and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland. The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. Among the initiatives being pursed are improvements in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years, with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.  It is a strategic long term project which allows the Beneluxa members to work closely together to identify pragmatic solutions to the challenges which we all now face with regards to medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p></reply>

On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:</p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future. </p></reply>

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for full eligibility (a medical card). The HSE assesses applicants and awards medical cards in accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended) and the HSE Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card. This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  In overall terms, agri-food exports to countries outside the EU have increased from around &euro;2.7 billion to &euro;3.6 billion in the period 2014 to 2018. This represents very rapid growth of 36% in that four-year timeframe. Among the highlights in 2018, the Chinese authorities opened their market to Irish beef imports by listing several approved Irish beef establishments, and agreements were reached with Qatar and Kuwait, allowing for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the Ukrainian market was opened for Irish beef and pork in April, while in May, the under-30 months restriction on Irish beef exports to Japan was lifted. This was followed in June by an agreement in principle on access for Irish sheepmeat to the Japanese market.</p>  <p>  In addition, and against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada, Japan and Mexico, my Department continues its efforts to open new markets while further deepening trade with existing markets. Trade Missions play an important role in this work, and in this regard I have visited Turkey, China, Japan and South Korea in 2019, with further missions planned before the end of the year. The choice of destinations are in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia in December 2017, at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise. </p></reply>

The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.  </p>  <p>  Labelling of food is governed by the EU food legislation on the provision of Food Information to Consumers (Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011), which lays down strict rules on labelling of ingredients. Country of origin labelling is mandatory for certain meats and other products such as honey and wine. From 1 April 2020 it will be mandatory to indicate the country of origin of the primary ingredient (which makes up more than 50% of a food) if it is different from the country of origin of the product as a whole.  </p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.   </p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.</p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.  These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.</p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by my Department ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.</p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.  The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.</p></reply>

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes. </p>  <p>  The method of selecting cases for inspection is set down in EU regulations and is undertaken by means of a risk analysis process with cases being selected on a risk and random basis.  All cases to be selected for inspection must be eligible beneficiaries under the various schemes. Therefore, the selection of cases for inspection, while commencing after the closing date for receipt of applications, i.e. 15th May, is an on-going process so as to ensure this specific regulatory requirement is adhered to.</p>  <p>  My Department accepted late applications up to 9th June 2019, with a penalty deduction. Furthermore, as amendments to applications could be accepted by my Department up to 9 June, and allowing for the Preliminary Checks process whereby applicants could amend their application further up to 19th June as a result of issues notified to them by my Department, the details of the land to be subject to the inspection process cannot be finally established until these periods have elapsed.    </p>  <p>  The process of a Remote Sensing inspection involves a comprehensive review of the satellite imagery received at two stages during the year, and also the assessment of additional imagery, where required, to ensure that the actual claimed area in the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the applicant, that the crop types are as claimed and that ineligible land or features are not included for payment purposes. The governing regulations further prescribe that where it is not possible to make an accurate determination on the eligibility of a parcel or parcels of land by means of an assessment of the available imagery, a field visit must be undertaken to verify the position on the ground. </p>  <p>  Some 6,840 applicants have been selected for a Remote Sensing inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 14th October, my Department had received inspections results in respect of 71% of these cases for final processing. Of these cases, over 90% have been finalised and advanced to payment stage processing, which ensures that any non-inspection related scheme criteria have been met. For example, an applicant under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme must meet scheme specific criteria relating to stocking density and stock retention periods before payment can issue.</p>  <p>  Where an over-declaration in area, at scheme level, is identified as part of the inspection process, officials in my Department contact the applicant concerned giving them the opportunity to accept the inspection findings or to submit comments for examination. Currently, 9% of cases for which inspection results have been received are at this stage of the process and will be finalised when the applicant contacts my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to finalise the outcome of Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that payments due are issued as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Our three pillar approach to carbon neutrality is through:</p>  <p>  1. Reducing agricultural emissions;</p>  <p>  2. Increasing carbon sequestration; and</p>  <p>  3. Displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.</p>  <p>  As recognition of the importance of acting quickly I have allocated an additional &euro;3 million to fund additional pilot projects in 2020 aimed specifically at climate measures in agriculture. Building on the success of our locally-led environmental schemes through the Rural Development Programme, some of this fund will be used to fund a call for a new pilot EIP scheme on reduced management of farmed peat-land. My Department will issue a call for proposals in due course. This is designed to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to meeting our commitments as part the Government Climate Action Plan.  It will also enhance the protection of bio-diversity and water quality and provide a template for action in advance of Irelands next Common Agriculture Policy.</p>  <p>  With regard to the rest of the allocation, my officials are currently in the process of scoping out additional pilot projects that will deliver on our climate ambition and will follow my Department&rsquo;s three pillar approach to carbon neutrality as highlighted above. These projects will then go through a prioritisation process to ensure that they are most effective in positive environmental impact and present best value for money. Behavioural change will be a key component of any project as action will be required on all our 139,000 farms.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to review options that will enable our farmers to transition to a low carbon economy while also being aware of the need to maintain economic competitiveness and increase our agricultural output.</p></reply>

Bord Bia figures indicate that half of this growth has come from markets outside of Europe. </p>  <p>  Encouragingly, exports to our more traditional and existing markets such as other EU states exceeded &euro;4 billion for the second year running. Notably strong growth was evident in pigmeat, poultry and dairy exports to the EU, with export values increasing to the Netherlands, Italy and Spain in particular. </p>  <p>  Market and trade insight suggest that global demand for Irish food and drink will remain positive to the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Developing market access and trade opportunities is a key part of this Department&rsquo;s response to the challenges posed by Brexit, and is very much in line with the market development theme of Food Wise 2025. This strategy outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. However, it must also be acknowledged that this is a long-term strategy, and that new markets can take time to develop and grow.</p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this work.  In March 2019, I visited Turkey to promote live animal exports while in May and June,  I visited China, South Korea and Japan, where agreement was reached in principle to allow access for Irish sheepmeat to the Japanese market. This development followed the announcement in May 2019 of the removal of the under-30 months restriction for Irish beef exports to Japan. This means that all Irish beef is now eligible for export to this very valuable market.</p>  <p>  These, and the other missions that my Department are planning for the latter half of 2019 and early 2020, will also serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access.  The destinations are also in keeping with the market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia in December 2017, at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers as we continue to navigate the very uncertain environment created by Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise. </p></reply>

Available data testifies to greater diversification in export outlets for the agri-food sector generally. The value of food and drink exports has increased substantially over the last number of years, to reach &euro;13.6 billion in 2018, with much of this growth coming from markets outside Europe. The challenge now for meat industry stakeholders is to build on this positive trend.</p><p>Developing new markets and growing existing markets on the basis of market insights &ndash; is one of the five themes of Food Wise 2025, a ten-year strategy for the Irish agri-food sector. Market development and diversification is also a key response to mitigate the exposure of the Irish meat industry to Brexit.</p><p>In April 2017, I launched a seven-point action plan on market access. This plan is being implemented through a variety of actions, including:</p><p>- A market prioritisation exercise and subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of my  Department. The countries selected for a detailed examination with regard to meat were Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia;</p><p>- A market access web portal was  launched in May 2018 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. It  provides much valuable information on potential market opportunities for exporters: </p><p>- An enhanced programme of Ministerial agri-food trade missions, in cooperation with Bord Bia and other State agencies.</p><p>These missions feature high level political meetings as well as promotion opportunities for Irish meat which serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in those destinations.</p><p>Recent trade missions have focused on key growth markets such as:</p><p>- Asia:  China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia;</p><p>- North America: USA, Mexico and Canada;</p><p>- The  Gulf States and Turkey.</p><p>Since April 2017, agreement has been secured for the export of Irish meat to several new third country (non-EU) markets, including:</p><p>- Beef (frozen boneless under 30 months) to China;</p><p>- Sheepmeat to Japan;</p><p>- Beef &amp;amp; Pork to Ukraine;</p><p>- Beef, Sheepmeat &amp;amp; Poultrymeat to Kuwait and Qatar.</p><p>Furthermore, during this period, enhanced meat access was agreed with Japan, Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. </p><p>The role of my Department is to open and broaden market access for Irish meat. It is up to industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to exploit the opportunities created as trading conditions permit. Since the UK referendum result in 2016, I have allocated significant additional funding to Bord Bia to enable it to develop new markets and enhance existing ones.</p></reply>

To achieve these challenging and ambitious targets will require immediate action through early adoption and high levels of take-up of the identified actions across our 139,000 plus family farms.  I see three important actions that can be advanced immediately.</p>  <p>  - Deepening engagement with farmers and other stakeholders along the food supply chain to promote the necessary deployment of new technologies and changes in farming practices;</p>  <p>  - Improving nitrogen use efficiency such as widespread adoption of low emissions slurry spreading or introduction of clover in grassland swards; and</p>  <p>  - Continuing our support for research and innovation such as animal breeding, improved grassland and fertiliser management and examining the potential of novel feed additives in grass-based production systems.</p>  <p>  In addition, Food Wise 2025, the latest ten year strategy for the agri-food sector published in July 2015 identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper. Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectoral recommendations. </p>  <p>  If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee, which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, believes that the growth projections are achievable by 2025. With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high value added product development.</p>  <p>  Preparations have begun within my Department on developing the next 10 year strategy to replace Food Wise 2025. It is envisaged that this will be published in 2020. Without pre-empting the content of the next plan, it is clear that the broad, cross-cutting themes contained in Food Wise will continue to remain highly relevant. Clearly, there are broader policy developments that will have a strong impact on the development of the strategy, particularly CAP reform, climate action and Brexit. </p></reply>

Government responses include a series of low interest loan schemes, including most recently the new &ldquo;Future Growth Loan Scheme&rdquo;, which will bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market and will support strategic long-term capital investment in a post-Brexit environment by SMEs, farmers and fishermen. The Scheme will build on last year&rsquo;s &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme. Up to 4 October 2019, a total of 2,118 applications have been approved for these two schemes with 495 progressed to sanction at bank level to a total value of &euro;94.2 million, of which about &euro;35.9 million relates to farmers and food businesses.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also saw the introduction of a &euro;78 million Brexit Resilience Package for the Agri Food sector. The measures included &euro;44m of direct aid for farmers, &euro;27m in Brexit related supports for the food industry and &euro;7m for DAFM Brexit-preparations.  Bord Bia received an additional &euro;5 million, bringing their total Grant in Aid to &euro;46.6 million. This represented a 60% increase in funding for their food and drinks marketing, promotion and training programmes since 2014. Additional funding was also allocated to Teagasc to assist in the development of the Prepared Consumer Foods Centre in Ashtown and the National Food Innovation Hub in Fermoy. </p>  <p>  In August, I introduced the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) which provides for up to &euro;100m in support, in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty arising out of Brexit.</p>  <p>  And finally, as part of the &lsquo;No-Deal&rsquo; contingency fund announced in Budget 2020, &euro;110m will be made available in the first tranche to the agri-food sector, to be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU. This will provide immediate support for our beef sector (&euro;85m), our fishing fleet (&euro;14m), our food companies (&euro;5m) and necessary support to other sectors to improve competitiveness (&euro;6m) in the event of a hard Brexit on 31 October.</p></reply>

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations. If these recommendations are implemented, the expert committee which drew up the Food Wise 2025 Strategy believe that the ambitious growth projections were achievable by 2025, including increasing the value of agri-food exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion; and creating 23,000 direct and indirect jobs all along the supply chain. </p>  <p>  In July this year, I launched the fourth annual progress report of Food Wise 2025, Steps to Success 2019. This showed that by 2018 exports had increased by 19.9% and primary production by 13.3% compared to the baseline. </p>  <p>  As of Q2 2019, of the 376 detailed actions which were due to commence by 2019 or are ongoing actions, 87% have been achieved or substantial action has been undertaken and the remaining 13% have commenced and are progressing well. </p>  <p>  Some of the highlights of recent years include the development of supports for industry such as &lsquo;Meat Technology Ireland&rsquo;, the strategic research and innovation base for beef and sheep meat processing; the &lsquo;VistaMilk SFI Research Centre&rsquo;, focusing on innovative precision pasture-based dairying; and most recently the new &lsquo;Prepared Consumer Food Centre&rsquo;. All of these are contributing to creating Irish value-added agri-food products to keep Ireland competitive in the global food market.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the EU quality policy aims at protecting the names of specific products to promote their unique characteristics, linked to their geographical origin as well as traditional know-how. There is evidence that the granting of a &ldquo;geographical indication&rdquo; to a product (Protected Geographical Indication - PGI, Protected Designation of Origin - PDO &amp;amp; Traditional Specialties Guaranteed - TSG) can add value in the market place, providing an economic advantage for producers and for rural areas. The indications help to distinguish a product against competition. </p>  <p>  Through these schemes, Ireland can build on its excellent global reputation as a producer of quality food. Ireland has several products registered and several other products are under consideration. My Department, along with relevant stakeholders, is currently working towards submitting an application to the EU Commission for Protected Geographical Indication status for Irish beef.</p></reply>

I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently.

Commercially sensitive coverage data has been provided to my Department by commercial operators and this data have been anonymised to produce the NBP Map. As such, the number of premises in the dark blue area is not available by reference to each commercial operator but as an aggregated number where at least one operator and in many cases more than one operator is providing high speed broadband services. </p>  <p>  As a State intervention, the National Broadband Plan must comply with the requirements of the European Commission&rsquo;s Guidelines on the application of the State aid rules to broadband networks. The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise and public consultation process in particular to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required.</p>  <p>  Since July 2013, my Department has engaged in an ongoing and extensive process of mapping and monitoring of broadband availability in Ireland. This has been supported by a number of public consultations from 2014 to date. This process has included a review of operator networks in line with the assessment criteria published in 2015.</p>  <p>  My Department recently consulted publicly to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. The scope of this consultation included all premises currently included in the Intervention Area as well as all those premises marked as blue on the NBP map. In addition, the Department had identified approximately 46,000 premises in blue areas of the Map where high speed broadband services may not have materialised and sought information in relation to these, or other similar premises, from operators, or the public. That consultation closed on 30 September.</p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions have been received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small telecoms operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p>  <p>  Operator submissions will be assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria. Operators submitting planned investments were required to sign a declaration that they would enter into a Commitment Agreement with the Department if their plans satisfied the assessment criteria and were accepted by the Department as being concrete and credible.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the Department&rsquo;s assessment, the non-confidential versions of all submissions will be published, as soon as possible, on the Department&rsquo;s website together with the outcome of the assessment.</p>  <p>  The consultation will identify where an existing high speed broadband service is available from a commercial operator along with where there are concrete plans to provide such a service. These areas will not be included in the Intervention Area.

The Project Officers facilitate project promoters to ensure that correct and appropriate environmental and governance procedures are followed. </p>  <p>  IFI are conscious at all times of the need and requirement to ensure a holistic approach to fisheries development that does not damage sensitive habitats or fauna. Earlier this year IF made an additional resource available to the PMO to further support the design elements of river habitat enhancement projects. </p>  <p>  This additional appointee is involved, inter alia, in the design of certain river habitat enhancement projects, on OPW drained channels, that have been allocated funding. This support is aimed particularly towards applicants to overcome any perceived inability or uncertainty in progressing design elements. I am advised by IFI that it anticipates that the design and development of these projects will continue into 2020.</p>  <p>  In 2017 IFI established a panel of environmental engineering consultants to carry out, if required, feasibility studies and engineering designs in environmentally sensitive habitats. To date IFI has not had to request that they prepare any instream fishery enhancement plans. Use of the panel is not obligatory and applicants are free to use other suitably qualified and insured consultants. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that in 2018 IFI awarded funding to 3 instream fisheries enhancement projects. In 2019 IFI expects to award funding to 8 instream enhancement projects.</p></reply>

Government has committed to delivering a whole of Government approach, and to working with local stakeholders, to ensure that a just transition is provided to those impacted. </p>  <p>  The most immediate challenge arises in the Midlands. I have met with key stakeholders there, including the Midlands Regional Transition Team, Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee, and the Midlands Regional Skills Forum, who have adopted a central objective of transition to a low carbon economy for the region.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 includes a number of measures that form part of the Government's approach to supporting a Just transition. They include:</p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for bog restoration and rehabilitation; and</p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades.</p>  <p>  These measures will be immediately targeted at the Midlands and will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further engagement with local stakeholders, including the Midlands Transition Team, on the application of the funding. Further details of this comprehensive whole of Government response to support the transition will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following the closure of the former Bord na Mona peat briquette factory in Littleton, a partnership between Bord na M&oacute;na and a Chinese recycling company, Sabrina, was announced in July this year. This has seen the creation of 40 long term, sustainable, jobs at a new recycling facility on the site, with a further 40 or more jobs envisaged in the next three years. This recycling facility has the capacity to repurpose 24,000 tonnes of plastic which will be diverted from landfill; this is a real example of how Bord na M&oacute;na is adapting its business model to reflect its move out of carbon intensive businesses. </p>  <p>  I am open to receiving a submission from regional stakeholders on the challenges which might need support in the context of a Just transition.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- Establishing the 2050 target in law</p><p>- Making the adoption of carbon budgets a legal requirement</p><p>- Requiring the Government to set a decarbonisation target range for each sector, with the Minister with primary responsibility for each sector identified being accountable for delivering the relevant actions to meet the sectoral target and report annually on the delivery of their actions and achieving sectoral emission targets</p><p>- Establishing the Climate Action Council as a successor organisation to the Climate Change Advisory Council with a revised remit</p><p>- Establishing that the Climate Action Plan shall be updated annually</p><p>- Establishing that a Long-Term Climate Strategy, to match the period covered by the three five year carbon budgets, shall be published</p><p>- Ensuring that the proposed governance arrangements retain sufficient flexibility to allow necessary reorientation of policy in the light of changing technologies, circumstances, challenges and opportunities over the period to 2030 and beyond.</p><p>The General Scheme is currently being prepared taking account of these new provisions. </p><p>As committed under the Plan, I intend to publish the Climate Action (Amendment) Bill in quarter 1, 2020.</p></reply>

Any delays or barriers will be detrimental for these sectors in particular. Air-freight is, generally speaking, not considered to be a financially-viable alternative for the transport of food products.</p>  <p>  Recent reports from the UK indicate the potential for significant reductions in traffic volumes through key ports such as Dover and Holyhead as a result of the additional requirements for customs and other regulatory documentation and procedures. Significant new infrastructure, and associated staffing, is in place in Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort to implement the additional customs, agriculture and environmental health controls that will be required when the UK leaves the EU. While these are designed to minimise the level of disruption that may arise from the additional checks, some disruption can be expected.  Irish officials also continue to engage with their French counterparts to ensure that Irish haulers arriving in French ports, particularly Calais, via the landbridge can exit the port as efficiently as possible.</p>  <p>  The alternative to the landbridge is the direct shipping connections between Ireland and continental ports. </p>  <p>  The assessment of my Department and the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), based on extensive consultations with the shipping sector, is that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, because of disruption to the GB landbridge, the shipping sector can and will respond quickly to meet such demands.</p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, there has already been an additional increase in capacity over the past 18 months on direct routes with more planned for 2020. </p></reply>

As regards F&aacute;ilte Ireland support for hiking trails, I am advised that the agency does not currently have any direct investment platform for trail development or associated facilities such as car-parks or bathrooms.  Nonetheless, I know that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has established a partnership with the Department of Rural and Community Development on its Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, which comes under the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  I understand that this scheme supports the development of new outdoor recreation infrastructure (including walking, cycling and water-based trails) and the maintenance and enhancement of existing trails and other qualifying infrastructure. Under the partnership with the Department of Rural and Community Development, which administers this scheme, I believe F&aacute;ilte Ireland is due to contribute c. &euro;15m of the overall funding available over four years, to be targeted specifically at visitor-focused investments for those trails and other outdoor recreational infrastructure with most tourism potential.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that it continues to provide a safe and reliable infrastructure that enables the provision of quality rail services for passengers across the country.  </p>  <p>  The funding secured under Project Ireland 2040 means that we are in a position to provide the steady state level of funding required through a recurring and significant capital investment of around &euro;200 million every year from the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  As you know, another of the commitments contained within Project Ireland 2040 is to continue to keep under review the potential extension of the existing M3/Parkway Line northwards to Navan.  The next review of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area must be completed by 2021 and that review will reconsider the population and commuting forecasts in order to determine whether any revised Strategy might include such an extension. I understand that this review will commence in the latter half of next year.</p>  <p>  I note that the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area categorises the M3/N2 route as a core regional bus network, and with the Kingscourt area currently served by bus based public transport, the area will benefit from the planned improvements along that corridor under Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  I can again confirm to the Deputy however, that there is no funding allocated under Project Ireland 2040 for the reopening of the disused Kingscourt rail line nor to undertake a feasibility study on the line.</p></reply>

It also has responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of Local Link services. </p>  <p>  Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and small public service vehicles (SPSV) services, which include Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney services.  </p>  <p>  The bus and coach services include Public Service Obligation (PSO) services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and other operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, licensed services provided by commercial operators and Local Link services.  These services comprise conventional fixed services with regular routes, stopping places and timetables and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services which respond to local demands and which constitute the majority of Local Link services. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, I am committed to the further development of public transport in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services. For example, there has been a substantial increase in funding for Local Link services since 2016, going from &euro;12.2 million in 2016 to &euro;21 million this year. This significant level of investment will continue in 2020.</p>  <p>  This level of investment in Local Link services has enabled the introduction of new regular commuter services and improvements to demand responsive services, as well as the introduction of new evening and night-time services across all counties. Key features of these developments include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages. </p>  <p>  In addition to its initiatives to improve Local Link services, the NTA has also designed initiatives to cultivate the provision of SPSV services in some rural areas. Ireland has a dispersed settlement pattern and low population densities in rural areas presents a challenge to the sustainable provision of such services. The NTA launched a new Pilot Local Area Hackney Scheme in August, seeking applications for the provision of a local area hackney service in a number of designated areas nationwide. A Pilot Community Car Scheme is expected to be announced later this year.</p>  <p>  The NTA is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its PSO services, including improvements to many non-urban services. Over 100 stage carriage &amp;amp; rural routes are operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann, generally linking a series of settlements of various sizes in a particular region. The scope and scale of the changes implemented recently or planned for the remainder of 2019/early 2020, include improvements to its city and town services and non-urban networks, including improvements to the Mullingar and Dundalk Commuter services, Ballina-Westport-Galway Corridor, Ballina-Sligo-Enniskillen Corridor, West Cork Network, Connemara Network, East and West Clare Networks, Kerry Network, Dundalk to Drogheda linking coastal villages and M11 Corridor. Network changes being implemented on stage carriage services focus on delivering enhanced frequency throughout the day with earlier/later departures, more frequency, increased weekend services including on Sundays/Public Holidays. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme for a Partnership Government undertakes to examine how best to improve integration of services in the rural bus network within regions. This matter is being examined and developed by my Department in the context of the wider work on which it has embarked around a review of public transport (Sustainable Mobility) policy, which is another commitment in the Programme for Government.  I will be launching a public consultation shortly seeking the views of all stakeholders. I look forward to receiving the views of members of the House regarding all aspects of sustainable mobility, including in relation to both climate change and rural transport.</p></reply>

Within my Department's overall funding allocation, &euro;9m has been assigned in Budget 2020 specifically to provide for a Carbon Reduction Programme to support measures which aid in decarbonising the transport sector. From within this allocation, funding is sourced as required for Green Public Transport Fund projects.</p>  <p>  The Fund was envisaged to support the piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively fuelled technologies for Public Service Obligation (PSO) operations within the bus fleet and small public service vehicles (SPSV) sector, as well as bridging the price differential between such technologies and conventionally fuelled vehicles. The role of the Fund has, however, evolved in line with new policy commitments and increased climate ambition. </p>  <p>  Implementing our commitment under Project Ireland 2040, since this summer, Ireland is no longer buying diesel-only urban public buses. The Deputy will be aware that a decision was taken by the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for procurement of vehicles in the public bus fleets, to purchase hybrid-electric buses in the short term. Dublin Bus has now taken delivery of six electric-hybrid buses, with a further three expected to be delivered before year end, supported by the Green Public Transport Fund. In addition, the Fund was deployed earlier this year to support the Low-Emission Bus Trials, the findings of which will help inform our longer term purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. The Climate Action Plan sets out a clear commitment that by the end of 2020, the first one hundred low-emission buses will have entered the urban bus fleet; I expect to deploy the Fund to contribute towards meeting this target.</p>  <p>  Funding has also been targeted to support the transition of the national SPSV (taxi, hackney and limousine) fleet, where electrification presents an achievable decarbonisation pathway, to alternative technologies. I established the Electric Taxi Grant Scheme in 2018, providing grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, in addition to the range of other incentives supporting electric vehicles. This initiative has resulted in the registration of 65 electric taxis to date and will be continued and expanded in 2020.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that while the Green Public Transport Fund has an important role to play in the transport emissions mitigation effort, it is only one small element of a far wider range of transport measures being implemented to help reduce emissions including: the range of incentives to encourage a transition away from conventional fuels towards lower emitting alternatives, such as EVs; increasing the proportion of biofuels in the fuel mix; improving efficiency standards for vehicles; and of course the significantly enhanced funding I am making available to support the development of new and improved public and sustainable transport infrastructure.</p></reply>

Funding under CEF is delivered in the form of grants allocated following competitive calls for proposals. As of June 2019, Irish beneficiaries participate in 24 projects and receive &euro;103 million in CEF Transport co-funding, with total investments in these projects of &euro;403.7 million. The EU funding provided is not readily available by year.</p><p>These include successful applications for the deployment of Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) and road transport projects with other Member States, which includes studies on the harmonisation of interoperable intelligent transport systems (ITS) and cooperative Intelligent transport systems (C-ITS). </p><p>Details of Ireland&rsquo;s successful projects under the CEF programmed are available on the INEA website at the following weblink:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Details of Ireland&rsquo;s successful projects for the programming period 2007-2013 are available at the following weblink:</p><p><i></i></p><p>In addition, the European Commission has recently recommended Donegal County Council for &euro;4.335 million co-funding under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) 2019 call for proposals.</p><p>The project concerns the studies or preparatory work required to remove bottlenecks over a length of 31 km at three road sections in Co Donegal: Ballybofey to Stranorlar; Letterkenny to Manorcunningham; and Manorcunningham to Lifford/Strabane. This covers the designs and reports required to obtain the necessary statutory and other approvals to facilitate the future construction. The Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) is in the process of finalizing the grant agreement with Donegal County Council. The final co-funding amount will be contingent on this grant agreement and an agreed project and expenditure plan being implemented by the Council with INEA oversight.</p><p>Further details on the Donegal County Council project are available here: <i></i></p><p>With regard to transport infrastructure in the west of Ireland, the Deputy may wish to note that, in August 2019, honouring a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, I made a submission to Commissioner Bulc on the matter of reviewing the TEN-T network in which I outlined national policy developments since the TEN-T Regulation came into force in 2013. These developments include the Government's National Development Plan and National Planning Framework, jointly referred to as Project Ireland 2040, and the implications of Brexit on Ireland's international connectivity. </p><p>The submission highlighted in particular the potential for increased geographical isolation of Ireland&rsquo;s Western and Northwestern regions. I also pointed out that Brexit is likely to have regionally differentiated effects in Ireland and that a hard Brexit could hit Border counties particularly hard. Continued EU support for transport investment projects therefore becomes even more important in the context of Brexit, after which our peripheral location on the western point of Europe will leave us even more isolated from other EU Member States. </p><p>The submission also noted that the improvement of regional connectivity along the Western seaboard, linking together the major urban areas to allow the Atlantic Economic Corridor (AEC) achieve its potential, is a major priority for Government. In this regard, I highlighted the work of the AEC Taskforce, chaired by Se&aacute;n Canney TD, Minister of State for Community Development, Natural Resources and Digital Development.</p><p>A copy of the submission can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: </p><p><i></i></p><p>Finally, EU Transport Commissioner,  Ms Violeta Bulc, wrote to EU Transport Ministers in February 2019, announcing that the European Commission is advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. This review process will include: an evaluation study, due to be completed in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation, which was open for contributions from April to July 2019; and targeted consultations with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders expected to take place during Q4 of 2019. Details on these consultations are yet to be confirmed but they will be an opportunity to elaborate further on the issues raised in the submission and to highlight other key priorities and possible amendments to the TEN-T guidelines that would be necessary in light of relevant developments since 2013. </p><p>The Commission intends to present the preliminary findings of the review process in May 2020, with a more detailed document envisaged for Summer 2020. Pending the findings of the review, a legislative proposal to amend the TEN-T Regulation may follow during 2021.</p></reply>

The Scheme&rsquo;s objectives are to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families, and establish a sustainable platform for investment in the Irish childcare sector for decades to come.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2020 provided that the maximum subsidised hours available under the Scheme will be increased from September 2020. The maximum &quot;enhanced&quot; hours will increase from 40 to 45 hours. This will be of particular benefit to school age children who need childcare before or after school, as well as parents juggling long working hours and commuting schedules.  The maximum &quot;standard&quot; hours subsidy will also increase from September 2020 from 15 to 20 hours. This will benefit families where parents are not working or studying. This will support the Scheme&rsquo;s objective of promoting employment, reducing poverty and improving outcomes for children. </p><p>The following table provides answers the Deputy's question. In answering the question the following is noted:</p><p>- As the minimum income threshold is &euro;26,000, the top rate of subsidy applies to all net incomes below this.</p><p>- DCYA income models use a midpoint for each income increment as the subsidy tapers depending on income. That is, a person at the lowest point of an income increment will receive more than the stated example and a person at the highest point of an income increment will receive less than the stated example. The information requested is presented in the &ldquo;midpoint&rdquo; form. <table><tr><th>Reckonable Income </th><th>Rate per hour if your child is 0 - 1 years old </th><th>Rate per hour if your child is 1 - 3 years old </th><th>Rate per hour if your child is over 3 and not yet in school </th><th>Rate per hour if your child is School Age </th></tr><tr><td>&euro;22,500 </td><td>&euro;5.10 </td><td>&euro;4.35 </td><td>&euro;3.95 </td><td>&euro;3.75 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;27,500 </td><td>&euro;4.90 </td><td>&euro;4.18 </td><td>&euro;3.78 </td><td>&euro;3.58 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;32,500 </td><td>&euro;4.22 </td><td>&euro;3.61 </td><td>&euro;3.19 </td><td>&euro;3.03 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;37,500 </td><td>&euro;3.54 </td><td>&euro;3.05 </td><td>&euro;2.61 </td><td>&euro;2.48 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;42,500 </td><td>&euro;2.87 </td><td>&euro;2.48 </td><td>&euro;2.03 </td><td>&euro;1.93 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;47,500 </td><td>&euro;2.19 </td><td>&euro;1.92 </td><td>&euro;1.45 </td><td>&euro;1.38 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;52,500 </td><td>&euro;1.51 </td><td>&euro;1.35 </td><td>&euro;0.87 </td><td>&euro;0.83 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;57,500 </td><td>&euro;0.84 </td><td>&euro;0.78 </td><td>&euro;0.33 </td><td>&euro;0.33</td></tr></table></p><p>It is challenging to estimate the numbers who will take up the new Scheme, given that this scheme represents a considerable departure from legacy schemes and noting that the saver arrangements will run in parallel. However, it is estimated that approximately 60,000 to 65,000 children will benefit from targeted subsidies and 17,000 children will benefit from universal subsidies.</p></reply>

Accessing suitably qualified staff has been particularly difficult in very recent years and is due to both poor retention rates and the massive increase in investment that has seen a doubling of the number of childcare places and a subsequent major increase in demand for early learning and care practitioners. </p><p>The basic qualification requirement to work in the sector is a qualification in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications. When this requirement was introduced, unqualified staff who planned to retire in the coming years were given the opportunity to sign a 'grandfather' declaration. These declarations remain valid until September 2021. </p><p>A Level 6 qualification is only a requirement for room leaders delivering the ECCE programme. The Pobal 2017/18 survey indicated that 65% of those working in the sector in mid-2018 then had a relevant qualification at Level 6 or above, indicating that there were enough staff qualified at this level to meet requirements. However, I acknowledge the challenge many providers are reporting in retaining staff and recruiting new staff.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for the training and supply of the  early learning and care workforce and I understand from that Department that the numbers being trained is sufficient to meet  entry requirements. In Pobal&rsquo;s Early Years Sector Profile Report for 2017/2018, the staff turnover rate stood at 24.7%, which, despite a 3% improvement on the previous year, was at a very high level. I understand the 2018 / 2019 report will show a further small improvement. The primary issue that needs to be resolved is one of retention. </p><p>I believe that the key to addressing this challenge is undoubtedly improving wages and working conditions. Over the last 5 budgets, the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare has increased be an unprecedented 138%. We need to keep increasing the level of public investment if we are to secure services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p><p>I am doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. As well as increased investment generally, I have specifically targeted funding directly to providers, for example, a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in September 2017, &euro;19.4m annually of Programme Support Payments to providers to recognise their administration duties, Higher Capitation payments to ECCE services employing graduates. Also, I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage-levels. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.</p><p>In First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy I launched with the Taoiseach last November, I made a commitment to develop a new funding model that will leverage additional investment for certain criteria, for example, better pay, or full implementation of the curriculum. First 5<i></i>also includes a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan for the sector. My Department began work on the Workforce Development Plan earlier this year, and an initial public consultation will take place in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This reform is informed by the Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) 2014.  The VFMPR examined three existing targeted funding schemes, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, the Special Projects for Youth (SPY) scheme and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme. </p><p>Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding.  The review recommended the development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the existing schemes.  The review also made a number of recommendations for the future operation of such a funding scheme and its development in the years ahead, to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes-focused programme, designed to secure optimal outcomes for young people. </p><p>To facilitate the VFMPR's recommendations, I approved funding allocations for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017.  There have been 23 such sample projects approved since 2016, of which 21 were operational in 2018 and a further two commenced in 2019.  Of the 23 projects, seven have involved the augmentation of existing projects to respond to identified needs.</p><p>In determining the sample projects for funding, my Department has worked closely with the 16 Education and Training Boards, all of which were invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for new and/or augmented projects.  The 23 sample projects fall within 10 of the ETB areas. The remaining 6 ETBs are currently involved in a process to identify the local needs of young people in these areas, with a view to submitting applications for new or augmented services.</p><p>I believe that the reformed system will bring substantial benefits to our young people, and my Department will continue with this important work.  Please find at the link a table with details of the sample projects, which highlights the year the service commenced and the funding the service has received to date.</p></reply>

Tusla is the independent statutory regulator of early learning and care and school age childcare services in Ireland. In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice.</p>  <p>  Tusla conducted an inspection of the service in question - which catered for both pre-school and school-age children - in line with the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 on 19 June 2019. During this inspection it was observed that the service, which was approved for 140 children, was operating outside its registration status, with 171 children observed in attendance. Tusla advised the service to revert immediately to its approved registration status, and to take immediate remedial action to address the risk posed to children on the premises due to inadequate insurance. Tusla also referred the service to the Chief Fire Officer of Dublin City Council and to the Planning and Enforcement Section of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  Tusla carried out a follow-up inspection of the service on 10 September 2019, and found that up to 150 children were attending the service on a given day. Tusla again instructed the service to revert to its approved registration status.</p>  <p>  Tusla also received an application from the registered provider for registration of a school-age service which highlighted that the service has been operating in contravention of its planning permission, which states that the number of children to be accommodated at the facility must not exceed 141.  This has resulted in the regrettable situation described.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the understandable frustration of the parents involved, and I know that Tusla does also. However, the safety and welfare of children must be our foremost priority, and services must abide by the legislation that is in place.</p>  <p>  Tusla continues to engage with the registered provider to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible. </p>  <p>  30 City and Childcare Committees across the country are available to support parents and providers with issues relating to early learning and care and school age childcare. In this instance, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Childcare Committee is available to support parents who need assistance with sourcing alternative service provision and they have been working with local providers to ascertain availability of places, and with new services in the area who intend to create additional places.</p></reply>

The Scheme was an innovative response to facilitating the development and maintenance of 39 of Ireland&rsquo;s key walking trails. The Scheme includes 1,962 landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands. The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans.  These trails are part of a larger list of trails which are registered by Sport Ireland which comes under the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>The table lists the walking trails currently on the Walks Scheme and the length of each trail. The length refers to the full distance of the trail and not just the portion maintained by the landholders under the scheme.  It should be noted that some walks cross Local Authority boundaries and the relevant portion of the walk is recorded under each of the respective county headings.  There are, therefore, more than 39 individual section of walks listed below.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme.  In line with these commitments, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed. </p><p>In February of this year, I invited Expressions of Interest for the inclusion of additional trails in the scheme that meet specific qualifying criteria.  These include the walks meeting a sufficient standard to be included on Sport Ireland Trails register.  To date, 18 Local Development Companies have submitted 57 Expressions of Interest to my Department.</p><p>These Expressions of Interest are being reviewed and I expect to be in a position to announce the first tranche of trails to be added to the scheme shortly. There is no closing date for Expressions of Interest at this time, and interested parties can continue submit proposals for additional trails to be included in the Walks Scheme through their Local Authority or Local Development Company. <table><tr><th>WALK</th><th>LOCATION</th><th>Length of Walk in Km</th></tr><tr><td>Burren Way</td><td>CLARE</td><td>40.21</td></tr><tr><td>Wood Loop Ballyvaughan</td><td>CLARE</td><td>1.89</td></tr><tr><td>Black Head Loop</td><td>CLARE</td><td>12.01</td></tr><tr><td>Cliffs of Moher </td><td>CLARE</td><td>12.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sheeps Head Way</td><td>CORK</td><td>125.59</td></tr><tr><td>Beara Islands</td><td>CORK</td><td>26.93</td></tr><tr><td>Beara Cork</td><td>CORK</td><td>101.20</td></tr><tr><td>Duhallow Way</td><td>CORK</td><td>43.00</td></tr><tr><td>Whiddy Island Walk</td><td>CORK</td><td>1.86</td></tr><tr><td>Bluestack Way</td><td>DONEGAL</td><td>64.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sliabh Liag</td><td>DONEGAL</td><td>3.90</td></tr><tr><td>Sl&iacute; Chonamara</td><td>GALWAY</td><td>9.00</td></tr><tr><td>Western Way</td><td>GALWAY</td><td>17.28</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry Way</td><td>KERRY</td><td>131.98</td></tr><tr><td>Beara Kerry</td><td>KERRY</td><td>24.19</td></tr><tr><td>Cos&aacute;n Cuas na nEighe</td><td>KERRY</td><td>1.69</td></tr><tr><td>Carrountoohill</td><td>KERRY</td><td>6.63</td></tr><tr><td>Nore Valley</td><td>KILKENNY</td><td>18.50</td></tr><tr><td>Freshford loop</td><td>KILKENNY</td><td>8.00</td></tr><tr><td>O Gormans Lane</td><td>KILKENNY</td><td>4.00</td></tr><tr><td>Slieve Bloom Way</td><td>LAOIS</td><td>8.36</td></tr><tr><td>Miners Way Leitrim</td><td>LEITRIM</td><td>1.84</td></tr><tr><td>The T&aacute;in </td><td>LOUTH</td><td>40.00</td></tr><tr><td>Western Way Mayo</td><td>MAYO</td><td>15.25</td></tr><tr><td>Clogher Loops </td><td>MAYO</td><td>1.28</td></tr><tr><td>Burrishoole Loop 1</td><td>MAYO</td><td>7.05</td></tr><tr><td>Burrishoole Loop 2</td><td>MAYO</td><td>9.09</td></tr><tr><td>Croagh Patrick Heritage Trail </td><td>MAYO</td><td>14.70</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly Way</td><td>OFFALY</td><td>7.02</td></tr><tr><td>Suck Valley Way</td><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>105.00</td></tr><tr><td>Rinn Duinn</td><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>5.50</td></tr><tr><td>Miners Way Roscommon</td><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>30.00</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Way </td><td>SLIGO</td><td>9.64</td></tr><tr><td>Miners Way Sligo </td><td>SLIGO</td><td>19.32</td></tr><tr><td>Eamon a 'Chnoic</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>9.48</td></tr><tr><td>Birch Hill</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>5.8.33</td></tr><tr><td>Knockalough (Red Hugh)</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>6.40</td></tr><tr><td>Slieve Feilim Way</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>0.53</td></tr><tr><td>East Munster Way</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>1.60</td></tr><tr><td>Lough Derg Way</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>11.27</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary Heritage Way </td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>17.90</td></tr><tr><td>Devils Bit</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>0.43</td></tr><tr><td>Kilcommon Pilgrim Trail</td><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>2.26</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Way North</td><td>WICKLOW</td><td>24.00</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Illness Benefit is a payment made to insured people who are unable to work due to illness and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. To qualify for Illness Benefit a person must be unable to work due to illness, under the pensionable age and satisfy contribution conditions.</p><p>2. Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions.</p><p>Subject to certain conditions persons in receipt of IB and IP may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).  IB and IP are the only primary income support payments from which a person may request to move to a PCB payment.</p><p>The PCB scheme seeks to extend the welfare system by responding to individual situations where a person in receipt of IB or IP retains some capacity for, and wishes to, undertake some work in the open labour market - while also continuing to require income support from the State.  The objective of the scheme is therefore to support such persons to return to the workplace without fear of the loss of their income support.  The level of income support provided where a person moves on to PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction, regarding their capacity for work.</p><p>It is important to note in relation to PCB that:</p><p>- participation is voluntary.</p><p>- a person who participates on the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.</p><p>- a person on the PCB scheme, with an underlying entitlement to Invalidity Pension, will retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years.</p><p>- there is no requirement that a person must undertake work that is of a &lsquo;rehabilitative or therapeutic&rsquo; nature.</p><p>- there is no restriction on the number of hours worked. </p><p>- there is no restriction on earnings.</p><p>PCB has therefore been designed to support persons, in receipt of IB or IP (only), to return to work while also continuing to provide them with income support through the social welfare system.  PCB is not designed to provide income support while a person is undertaking an education or training course.</p><p>Where a person is not in employment the Department provides a range of supports. These include supports such as the back to education allowance (BTEA) as well as both income supports and employment &amp;amp; vocational guidance and assistance.</p><p>Courses available through the springboard initiative are open to persons in employment, persons who are unemployed and &lsquo;returners&rsquo;.  The springboard initiative is delivered by the HEA (see ) with eligibility for the courses determined by the HEA and the individual universities and other providers delivering the courses available under the initiative.  Persons who are unemployed and in receipt of a related payment, and subject to some conditionality (for example &ndash; a person who is unemployed must be in receipt of a payment for nine of the previous 12 months if they wish to participate on the one-year full-time ICT Skills Conversion courses), can access all springboard courses.</p><p>People in receipt of IB and IP (subject to some conditionality) are permitted to undertake/participate on training or educational programmes, however, they must seek prior written approval from the Department before commencing any such programme.  In addition, (also subject to some conditionality), persons in receipt of IB and IP are eligible for BTEA.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

On Budget Day I announced that the rate of JA and Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) will increase to the full rate for those jobseekers aged 18 to 24 years who are on age-related reduced rates and in receipt of State housing supports including Rent Supplement and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  This measure is effective from 6th January 2020 and will provide significant financial support towards their housing costs as the weekly JA and SWA rates for eligible jobseekers will increase by &euro;90.30 and &euro;88.30 respectively.  The estimated number of people who will benefit from this measure is 300 young people. </p>  <p>  Another measure which I introduced in Budget 2020 is the abolition of the age-related rate of payment for 25 year olds. This provides for the payment of up to the maximum weekly personal rates of &euro;203 per week for JA recipients and &euro;201 for SWA recipients from the current rate of &euro;157.80. This change is also effective from 6th January 2020 and will benefit almost 1,800 young people</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that where a young jobseeker participates in education or training they will receive the maximum personal rate of &euro;203 per week, less any means-related deductions.  Also, jobseekers who participate in the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS), a work experience scheme for young jobseekers who face barriers to employment, receive a maximum weekly payment of &euro;229.20.  Age-related reduced rates do not apply to jobseekers with a dependent child, who have  transferred to JA from disability allowance (DA), or who were in State care during the 12 months before age 18.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As a long term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP. Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.</p>  <p>  If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.  Accordingly, the determination of entitlement to HAP, including the assessment of an applicant's means, is governed by the same arrangements as for other social housing supports.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  The HAP application form comes in two parts; Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.</p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities. This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  The HAP scheme has been structured in a way that most protects the Exchequer funding by ensuring that payment issues only on valid and complete applications. For this reason rent is paid in arrears and ensures that money is only paid in respect of time that the property has actually been occupied by the tenant. This practice also avoids a situation where the local authority has to attempt to recover money from the landlord and simplifies the administration of the scheme.</p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2019, there were more than 48,000 households in receipt of HAP support and over 28,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

The plan focuses on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes and 87,000 other social housing supports by 2021.  In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.  The Plan also recognises the role of other State Agencies, including the Department of Health and HSE, in delivering services to those experiencing homelessness.  In September 2017, I established the Homelessness Inter-Agency Group to ensure the effective coordination of the State&rsquo;s response to addressing homelessness.</p>  <p>  In addition to increasing the supply of housing, we are also committed to ensuring that appropriate emergency accommodation is in place for individuals and families.  Budget 2020 provides an allocation of &euro;166m for the delivery of homeless services next year, an increase of &euro;20m on the 2019 allocation.  Homeless services are administered on a regional basis and the decisions on the organisation of services, including the provision of emergency accommodation, is a matter for the Management Group of each region.</p>  <p>  To minimise the use of hotels and B&amp;Bs for families experiencing homelessness, the Government is supporting local authorities to develop family hubs, through the provision of capital and operational funding. To date, 28 family hubs have been rolled out nationally. Households in emergency accommodation are supported by the local authorities and their service delivery partners to identify and secure an independent tenancy. </p>  <p>  In September 2018, the Government published the National Implementation Plan for Housing First. Housing First provides homes for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation who have complex health needs. Housing first tenants are provided with the necessary housing and health supports to ensure that they can sustain their tenancy. Local authorities are responsible for providing the housing supports and the HSE is responsible for providing the health supports. The Plan includes a target of 663 tenancies to be delivered by 2021.</p></reply>

With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that Cost Rental is not designed to replace social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for this Government. Cost Rental is one of several schemes which my Department is using to provide more affordable housing and deliver on Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s action plan for housing and homelessness.</p>  <p>  I have convened a working group within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other expert bodies. This group is developing the policy framework for the broader Cost Rental model and examining how a sustainable financing structure can be established to commence delivery of units at the scale required to get this new category of housing off the ground. The work of this group is being assisted by a consultancy and research support that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.</p>  <p>  This work is being informed through two Cost Rental pilot  projects, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter of these has already commenced construction, supported by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. The selection of further sites for Cost Rental consideration will be informed largely by the financial and operational model that will emerge from the evidence building that is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The rents for Cost Rental units will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants. These include subvention through the Serviced Site Fund, where &euro;310 million is being made available to local authorities over three years, 2019 to 2021, to support the delivery of infrastructure for the provision thereafter of more affordable housing to purchase or rent.</p></reply>

On the latter, a new scheme announced under Budget 2020 will provide for energy efficiency renovations to a large number of social homes in the midlands and is designed to explore an alternative approach to the upgrade of the social housing stock.  </p>  <p>  The specific design of the project will be driven by a Retrofit Taskforce, which has been established by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and includes officials from my Department. This Taskforce will work with local authorities in the midlands and other local stakeholders to identify areas of sufficient concentration of local authority housing stock with poor energy efficiency conditions.

While an individual occupier&rsquo;s rates liability may increase or decrease, the revaluation will not increase the overall commercial rates income of the local authority.  </p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, having obtained the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, makes a Rates Limitation Order (RLO) following a revaluation, directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of rates income in the following year to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, plus an element of buoyancy for valuations of newly constructed property and an adjustment for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.  RLOs have been made for each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date. </p>  <p>  The intention of section 56 was to provide that the impact of a revaluation would be revenue neutral for a local authority.  However, due to successful appeals by ratepayers following revaluations, the impact of the revaluations has resulted in a net decrease in rates in the year following a revaluation.  </p>  <p>  The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernises further the legislation governing commercial rates.  Section 21(d) of the Act amends the Rate Limitation Order formula to allow for the inclusion of a factor to take account of the level of appeals. The factor is set by the Minister in consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation.  This factor will be included in RLOs that will be made in the coming weeks in respect of the eight local authorities where revaluations have concluded this year.</p></reply>

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days would apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wished to avail of the proposed new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes would be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes would not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  These new planning reforms to regulate the short-term letting sector came into effect on 1 July 2019.  The final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term lettings was subsequently published on 26 July 2019.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the aforementioned changes to the planning code was primarily to address the longer term rental issues arising from the use of properties for short-term letting in designated rent pressure zones, which are areas of high housing demand. The new arrangements have only been in force for a short period of time but I will be monitoring their impact once a reasonable period of operation has elapsed.</p>  <p>  The broader regulation of tourism activity is beyond the scope of the planning code and my remit. On 31 July 2019, I wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, outlining the recommendations made by the Short-Term Letting Working Group and highlighting the measures taken by my Department to act upon these recommendations, specifically the introduction of the short-term letting legislation. I advised the Minister that the remaining recommendations fell under the remit of his Department to action. </p>  <p>  The Minister replied on 20 August, expressing a wish to ensure that there were no unintended consequences for the operation of the self-catering tourism sector arising from the implementation of the new regulations. In further correspondence on 19 September 2019, I again highlighted the significance of the introduction of the short-term letting legislation in the context of substantively addressing the recommendations of the Working Group and reiterated the importance of the outstanding recommendations and their relevance to the role of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I assured the Minister my support, and that of my Department, in addressing the outstanding recommendations falling under his remit. </p></reply>

I will shortly be appointing a chair to the reconfigured Advisory Group after which I will be asking all of the constituent bodies for their nominations.  My Department is also advancing arrangements for the development of the scoping document I have referred to.  Finally, officials in the Department are in contact with the Office of Public Works regarding the necessary works to the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17. </p>  <p>  I regard the Securing History 2 report as a significant milestone in the revitalisation of this crucial part of our capital city. The proposals put forward by Hammerson are sympathetic to and embrace the history and heritage of O&rsquo;Connell Street and the Moore Street area and can be aligned with the objectives of protecting the national monument at Nos. 14 -17, opening it to the public and resonating the mercantile, social and political heritage of the area as a 1916 commemorative quarter.
