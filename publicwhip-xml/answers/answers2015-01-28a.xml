For the first six years the PRTB was in receipt of Exchequer funding towards operational costs but has operated on a self-financing basis since 2010.The PRTB&rsquo;s funding is derived primarily from a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations, as set down by Ministerial Order.  The Board is currently entitled to retain 80% of the registration fee income to fund its activities, with 20% going to fund local authority inspections of rented accommodation under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008. It also retains the fees charged for its&rsquo; dispute resolution services. <br/><br/>The total number of personnel employed by the PRTB in whole time equivalents for the years in question is as follows:<br/><br/>-2010 &ndash; 65.4<br/><br/>-  2011 &ndash; 50.4<br/><br/>-  2012 &ndash; 37.4<br/><br/>-  2013 &ndash; 34.8<br/><br/>-  2014 &ndash; 30.3<br/><br/>The reduction in staffing in recent years needs to be seen in the context of the introduction of online tenancy registration and online dispute application services.  In 2012, the PRTB awarded a contract, outsourcing its call -centre activities and processing of paper registrations, allowing the Board to focus on its dispute resolution processes.  There are currently 28 people employed on the PRTB account by the outsourced service provider.<br/><br/>Given the sustained increase in demand for PRTB services, approval has been provided for an additional 4 permanent staff and 5 temporary staff and the Board is currently working with the Public Appointments Service to fill these posts.  My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this and other matters.  </p></reply>

I have also written to the Minister for Finance in this matter given his role for policy in respect of insurance.<br/><br/>All works under the pyrite remediation scheme will be completed to the requirements of the relevant standard, <i>I.S. 398-2:2013 Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &mdash; Part 2: Methodology for remediation works</i>, and will be carried out by competent builders, overseen by construction professionals in accordance with the requirements of the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency.  There will also be oversight by construction professionals from within the Housing Agency itself to ensure that the works will be fully compliant with the relevant requirements of the Building Regulations, that proper materials are used in the works and that remediated dwellings will be restored to the quality expected by the homeowners.  At the end of the works, each homeowner will be provided with certification to confirm that their home has been remediated to the requirements of the relevant standard.<br/><br/>My Department is available to meet with Insurance Ireland to address any concerns their members may have and I will support any proposals put forwardthat provide the basis for a satisfactory resolution for homeowners on this issue.  </p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.<br/><br/>A range of measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  These measures have been identified in the Government's <i>Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness</i>and in the <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>.  Progress in implementing these plans are reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website - the relevant link will be included in the Official Report.[.] <br/><br/>Implementation of these plans necessitates close liaison with the lead housing authorities in each of the 9 homelessness regions so as to ensure that the appropriate actions are being taken and funding available to address the homelessness needs in these regions.  My Department liaises with housing authorities for this purpose on an ongoing basis</p></reply>

The three local authorities in Counties Galway and Mayo received funding of almost &euro;1.9 million under this programme and returned 182 properties back to productive use.  The funding provided by my Department to return these properties to use is capped at &euro;30,000 per social housing unit.<br/><br/>The effective management of vacant and boarded up social housing units is a key aspect of achieving best practice and value for money in housing management, to assist local authorities in making best use of their existing stock.  For 2015, I will provide support to local authorities to target a further 1,000 such units and the aim over the lifetime of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>is to return 2,300 units to productive use.  I have also outlined in the Strategy that my Department will link future funding to the measured performance of local authorities on their ability to return vacant units to use and to put in place on-going maintenance programmes.</p></reply>

I have not received any assessment from Irish Water specifically in relation to the presence of asbestos pipes in the water infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Asbestos cement piping formerly used in local authority water mains was required to meet certain specifications including bitumen lining and coating.  The main health risk associated with asbestos products relates to inhalation of airborne asbestos particles.  The potential exposure to such risk led to the decline in the use of asbestos materials generally.  With the availability of more robust materials, asbestos cement piping is no longer used in Ireland for new public water mains or sewer pipes.</p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation's position on asbestos in drinking water is that there is no consistent evidence that ingested asbestos is hazardous to health and that there is no need to establish a health-based guideline value for asbestos in drinking water.  </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants including in relation to rent, security of tenure and the termination of tenancies.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.<br/><br/>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 is currently before the Oireachtas and will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for:<br/><br/>-  the inclusion of the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004;<br/><br/>-  the introduction of a new fast-track procedure to deal with non-payment of rent;<br/><br/>-  the introduction of a tenancy deposit protection scheme. <br/><br/>The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with Second Stage in the Seanad.  Legislative provisions for the deposit protection scheme, together with other amendments, are currently being drafted and it is my intention to introduce these amendments at Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad in the first quarter of 2015. <br/><br/>The Government published the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014.  The strategy provides the basis for a concerted and coordinated approach to social housing provision and contains an action plan with detailed objectives and timelines.  It includes a commitment to developing a national policy on the private rented sector aimed at increasing investment in and supporting the supply of, good quality, secure and affordable accommodation in the sector.<br/><br/>The PRTB published two major reports on the sector in 2014 and these reports, together with a forthcoming National Economic and Social Council (NESC) report on the future development of the private rented sector, will be important inputs to the process of developing the national policy.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-28a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012800071#WRA02400"><p>Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied complies with the chemical and microbiological parameters set out in the Regulations. The procedures to be followed and the roles of water suppliers, the EPA and the HSE where there is non-compliance with the parametric values set out in the Schedules to the Regulations, are clearly laid out in the Regulations.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in monitoring or supervising the delivery of water services.<br/><br/>The EPA&rsquo;s <i>Drinking Water Report 2013</i>highlights the current situation where 23,297 people are required to boil their water before drinking.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  Irish Water has stated that it has prioritised the elimination of boil water notices and has accelerated investing to accomplish this.  Irish Water has published its Proposed Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 and this is available on the Irish Water website ; the relevant weblink will be circulated with the official Report.  ()<br/><br/>The plan outlines a number of priorities to be delivered including improving water quality, tackling leakage, improving capacity and investing for economic development and it identifies where Irish Water considers investment in infrastructure is necessary for the effective performance of its functions.  This includescompliance with Water Framework Directive requirements, improving sewage treatment and collection infrastructure in accordance with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, responding to judgments of the European Court of Justice and achieving environmental and public health objectives arising from various regulations and EPA reports dealing with water quality.<br/><br/>In the case of County Roscommon specifically, I understand that in 2014 and 2015, Irish Water will spend almost &euro;20 million on 6 new plants in the county, which will remove over 17,000 people from boil water notices by next April.  In addition, I understand that a further major scheme for north-east Roscommon is at tender and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016, providing a modern high quality supply for 6,000 people currently on boil water notices.  </p></reply>

LCDP is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281 million over that period.

The proposals for the levy are as set out in the General Scheme for the Planning and Development No. 1 Bill which I published in November 2014.</p>  <p>  Under this scheme it is envisaged that the levy will be applied at a rate not exceeding 3% of the market valuation of a site in the first year, increasing incrementally by 1% in subsequent years up to a maximum levy not exceeding 6% of the market valuation of the site in ques tion in any individual year.  It is further proposed that the individual local authorities who decide to introduce this measure will be responsible for collecting the levy within their functional areas.   </p>  <p>  To be entitled to apply the levy, local authorities will in the first instance be required to provide for the development of vacant sites in specific locations within urban areas as an objective in their local development plans &ndash; thereby being an integral part of the local development planning process. </p>  <p>  The measure should be supplemented by the application of reduced development contributions on such sites when granted planning permission having regard to the likelihood that the development of such sites will be able to avail of existing infrastructure rather than be reliant on further investment in new infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In essence, the levy will entail a carrot and stick approach i.e. incentivising developers to develop vacant underutilised sites while also applying lower development contribution levies on the development of such sites, and only penalising those who opt not to bring forward proposals to develop such sites.  </p></reply>

This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years. <br/><br/>The challenge is to translate this potential supply line into actual construction on the ground to meet the demand of home seekers.  Most of the difficulties currently being encountered can be addressed by increasing the supply of properties available to buy, to rent, and to be provided by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.<br/><br/>The Government recognises that a whole of Government approach, working in close cooperation with key stakeholders, is the only way to tackle the challenge of increasing the supply of housing.  The implementation of the <i>Construction Strategy 2020</i>forms the basis for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance, and developing the construction workforce.  <i>Construction 2020</i>, and two Planning Bills currently being drafted, aim to remove blockages from the system in order to support increased supply, reducing the pressure on house price growth and help ing homebuyers to acquire a family home in their community of choice at reasonable cost.<br/><br/>Measures to increase supply will also impact positively on the private rental sector.  Historically, the private rental sector has been characterised by small scale landlords.  Attracting large scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example using Real Estate Investment Trusts and other options for long-term investment, hasan important role to play in helping to deliver a more professional and higher quality sector.<br/><br/>Social housing is also a key priority for Government, as evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014.The Strategy builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.<br/><br/>The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  This will help to ease pressure on the private sector.<br/><br/>In 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided-3,000 units through the leasing initiative; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use through a programme of refurbishment; a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme; and a further 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units will be delivered.  In addition, 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<br/><br/>I will be continuing to assign the highest priority to the implementation of both <i>Construction 2020</i>and the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>.</p></reply>

Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  Hard water is not included in the Schedule mentioned above as it does not pose as a threat to human health, nor indeed are the substances associated with hard water, such as lime, calcium and magnesium.</p>  <p>  The Water Charges Policy Direction issued to the CER in July 2014 referred to a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including where the quality of water services provided by Irish Water to customers is impaired or where services are reduced or restricted. Where a customer is subject to a drinking water restriction notice, affected customers will receive a 100% discount to the water supply portion of their bill for the duration of the restriction. Accordingly, the current legislation allows for discounts on charges for impaired services and no amendments to the Water Services Act 2014 are necessary.  However, as neither hard water nor the substances associated with it require the restriction of a supply, discounts would not apply in such cases  .</p></reply>

I will be setting out in law what the minimum content of these customer charters will be, so that standards of service are raised and are consistent.<br/><br/>It will also become a statutory requirement for all collectors to operate the &ldquo;pay-by-weight&rdquo; system as a condition of their permit.  The requirement for households, other than those already on a pay -by-weight system, to pay on a by-weight basis will not apply until 2016 so as to provide an appropriate lead-in time.<br/><br/>A levy on drinks containers will not be part of the new framework. In June 2012, as part of a commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i>to examine the introduction of a levy on such packaging in conjunction with a waste reduction programme, my Department initiated a root and branch review of all aspects of the Producer Responsibility Initiative model in Ireland.  My Department also completed a consultation process with stakeholders on this issue<b>.</b><br/><br/>Following completion of the consultation process and the receipt of the review report, it was decided, after careful consideration, not to proceed with the introduction of a packaging levy.  The primary reason for this decision was that the introduction of a packaging levy would be likely to generate a number of regulatory costs to business and the public sector with few identifiable benefits, given our very successful packaging recovery and recycling performance to date in Ireland.<br/><br/>In addition, the review report does not recommend the introduction of a levy as to establish such a scheme would be inappropriate, in view of the successful operation of the existing packaging scheme operated through Repak, as well as the high administrative costs of introducing such a system.<br/><br/>The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed at: .  </p></reply>

The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015.<br/><br/>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan - the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures over the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pr ogress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.  However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge arising in that period, but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.  It is also important to note that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill will provide for long - termsuccessive planning in this respect. <br/><br/>The general public and stakeholders have already had opportunities to submit views on the sectoral elements of the planned National Mitigation Plan in previous public participatory processes over the last year or so.  In continuing my commitment to openness and inclusiveness, I will shortly be inviting the views of the public and stakeholders on the preparation of the National Mitigation Plan currently being developed.  I look forward to receiving input from all interested parties on how we might address the specific challenges ahead and harness the opportunities as Ireland moves towards a low-carbon sustainable economic future.</p></reply>

No. 9 of 2014, must be construed together as one. Article 7 of the regulations addresses generally the application of Part II of the regulations which deals with commencement notices and certificates of compliance before construction.  Article 7 includes a general exemption in respect of works which is exempted development under the Planning and Development Acts.  Article 9(2)(b) applies the requirements relating to statutory certification to &ldquo;an extension to a dwelling involving a total floor area greater than 40 square metres&rdquo;.  The requirements for building control purposes in relation to an extension to a dwelling therefore fall into three categories as follows:</p>  <p>(a) works which constitute exempted development for planning purposes are   exempt from the requirements to supply a commencement notice and statutory certification;</p>  <p>(b) works which do not constitute exempted development for planning purposes and which remain under 40 square metres are subject to the requirement   to submit a commencement notice only;</p>  <p>(c) works which do not constitute exempted development for planning purposes and which are greater than 40 square metres are subject to the requirements to submit a commencement notice and statutory certification.   </p>  <p>  The idea that multiple and possibly concurrent extensions, each of less than 40 metres, may be used as a way of avoiding the requirement for statutory certification is precluded by the wording of article 9(2)(b) above where &ldquo;an extension&rdquo; must be read as &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; where those circumstances apply and the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; becomes operable.</p>  <p>  I have indicated that I am receptive to addressing concerns regarding the cost burden of the building control regulations in the case of one-off dwellings and extensions to dwellings.  I have instructed my Department   to review this aspect as a matter of priority and I expect to receive the outcome of this review next month.</p></reply>

A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at the following link: . <br/><br/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the Quarter 3 2014 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br/><br/>On 4 December 2014, I hosted a special Summit on Homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. A number of actions arising from the Summit were considered at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 8 December and were then formalised into an <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>which was noted by the Government at its meeting on 9 December 2014. A copy of this action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above. Progress in implementing this plan is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform and a copy of the most recent progress report is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the issue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the &lsquo;housing-led&rsquo; approach. I am pleased that there is enough accommodation available for all those sleeping rough and that no one needs to sleep rough unless they choose to do so. The number and availability of emergency beds is being monitored closely by Dublin City Council and further beds will be brought on stream should the need arise. Where a homeless person does not want to be placed in emergency accommodation, the Housing First intake street team will refer the person to the recently established Nite Caf&eacute; which is now fully operational. The Nite Caf&eacute; links in with the new Transport with support services for those sleeping rough as an integral part of the Housing First service. This initiative transports homeless persons to emergency accommodation and provides them with the necessary health and care supports in conjunction with other State providers.]<br/><br/>The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes. In November 2014, I launched the Government&rsquo;s <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. This six-year strategy sets out to provide 35,000 new social housing units at a cost of &euro;3.8 billion and restores the State to a central role in the provision of social housing through, inter alia, a resumption of direct building on a significant scale by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.<br/><br/>Additional funding for homeless services across the country in 2015 will ensure continued progress toward the achievement of the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. My Department is currently considering the appropriate allocation of the 2015 homelessness budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homelessness funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.</p></reply>

Accordingly, 2015 will be the first full year of the operation of a number of significant changes in the local government system such as the unification of city/county councils in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, the establishment of municipal districts and a range of new governance arrangements. Moreover, implementation of various reform measures is ongoing ; for example the adoption of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies by Regional Assemblies, established under a recent ministerial order, the formulation of local Economic and Community Plans in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department last week, the approval of new local authority corporate plans, and the adoption of Schedules of Municipal District Works by municipal district members in accordance with recently issued guidelines. In addition, I am also willing to consider further reforms which may be warranted beyond those provided for in the 2014 Act. In this regard, I recently announced further important local government reform initiatives involving independent reviews of local government arrangements in Cork and Galway by statutory committees.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, I consider that it would be premature to undertake any detailed review of the impact of the provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 at this stage. However, the implementation of the various reforms is kept under general review in consultation with the local authorities and the Association of Irish Local Government, which represents the elected councils of local authorities.   </p></reply>

My aim is to ensure that resources are allocated in the fairest way possible and to make the maximum contribution to tackling disadvantage, job creation and economic recovery. My Department&rsquo;s intention is, over time, to use the available knowledge of population levels and disadvantage to ensure that available resources are targeted at areas of greatest need. As a tool to assist with this, a Resource Allocation Model, or RAM, has been developed which allows relative disadvantage to be measured across all census areas. In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, my Department has in recent years worked to ensure that funding is protected for those areas which the RAM shows have greatest needs. This principle was used in deciding on funding allocations for SICAP and I am satisfied that the funding allocated to Dublin Inner City under SICAP is a fair allocation of resources for the area concerned. Details of the model are available at the following link:  <br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, SICAP is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway. The closing date for receipt of tenders under stage two was noon on 19 December 2014. The tenders received are currently being evaluated and tenderers will be informed of the outcome by mid February. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, m y Department has consulted with Dublin City Council and it is agreed that it would not be prudent to engage in a deliberative process, in respect of the service delivery mechanism for the inner city, until such time as the results of stage two of the SICAP procurement process are known. In the meantime, I can confirm that interim arrangements have been made to ensure that LCDP funding for the groups concerned will continue until 31 March 2015, pending the outcome of the SICAP competitive process. As the procurement process is still underway, I am not in a position to meet with the group sinvolvedat this time. </p></reply>

Overpayments are categorised as fraud, non-fraud or estate cases.<br/><br/>Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status.  Non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer or departmental error.  Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths. <br/><br/>People who have received an overpayment from the Department have a liability under law to refund the amounts involved.  Recoveries are not categorised by whether the original overpayment was fraud or error. <br/><br/>In 2013, the total value of debt recoveries amounted to &euro;70.7m.<br/><br/>The Department is not yet in a position to publicly comment on recoveries recorded in 2014 as these figures form part of the statutory accounts of the Department and are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></reply>

I understand that the Deputy&rsquo;s question is broader in nature and relates to supports that are available to not-for-profit companies and organisations under various work placement and training programmes.  The key programme providing supports to the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sectors is Community Employment (CE) using a combination of training and related on-the-job placement.  CE is also available in some public sector employment, mainly with local authorities.  Two other programmes provide support in the form of work placements exclusively to the community and voluntary sectors.  These are the Rural Social Scheme and T&uacute;s &ndash; the community work placement initiative.  Both of these schemes are delivered through local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in gaeltacht areas.  <br/><br/>The Community Services Programme provides supports in the form of wage subsidies to not-for-profit companies and co-operatives providing services of a social inclusion nature or where services are not provided due to lack of demand or other factors.  Private and not-for-profit employers may also access JobsPlus which provides a wage subsidy to employers who employ jobseekers who have been on the live register for periods of 12 months or more.  <br/><br/>In addition, a variety of supports are available from the Department to employers who provide employment opportunities to persons with a disability.<br/><br/>Further details in relation to all of these schemes are available on the Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; </p></reply>

It is one of a number of allowances payable on claims to payments such as the State pension contributory, which is paid in respect of people who have paid PRSI prior to pension age. </p>  <p>  Another of these allowances, namely the Qualified Adult Payment made in respect of spouses and civil partners, is normally paid where the pensioner has a spouse or civil partner who is financially dependent on them, and who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State pension contributory in his/her own right.  In most cases, such couples have additional income or means above their State pension, as otherwise they would obtain a higher payment by the spouse making a claim to the State pension (non-contributory), which is means-tested and has a maximum personal rate of &euro;219 weekly (plus additional allowances, such as the over-80 allowance, where applicable).</p>  <p>  There are some 7,750 qualified adults on contributory pensions who are at least 80 years of age, although this is expected to increase in the coming years.   The cost of extending the full allowance to both spouses on such claims (which would effectively double the allowance for claims where both spouses are over 80) would be over &euro;4 million per annum. </p>  <p>  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  Any proposals to extend the over 80 allowance would have to be considered in a budgetary context</p></reply>

The total number received to date is 134, and the numbers received in each month since July 2014 are set out in the following table. <br/><br/><b>Numbers received in each month since July 2014</b><table><tr><th>July 2014</th><th>August 2014</th><th>September 2014</th><th>October 2014</th><th>November 2014</th><th>December 2014</th><th>January 2015</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>28</td><td>34</td><td>42</td><td>11</td><td>6</td></tr></table><br/><br/>Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and Revenue officers have visited and taken samples from every filling station about which a complaint has been made about fuel contamination, and these samples have been referred to the State Laboratory for scientific analysis. Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, evidence of a prohibited stretching agent has been found in only two samples, both taken from one site. The conclusive results received in that particular case resulted in seizure of the product and a file is being prepared with a view to prosecution.<br/><br/>Following a series of further tests conducted by the state laboratory, results were received which indicated the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations. This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time. There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to mix normal road diesel with petrol. This contamination could have taken place well ahead of the problems related to fuel quality that manifested themselves in vehicles.<br/><br/>If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination resulting from diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. Revenue will also continue to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to share information and intelligence with them on this issue.<br/><br/>I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they undertake, on an ongoing basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud. This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data. In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis. <br/><br/>I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that action on this matter continues to be a priority. They will, accordingly, take all possible steps to identify the problem, to challenge any instance of identified fuel fraud and, where possible, to prosecute anyone found to be involved in fraudulent activity of that kind.</p></reply>

This is a major national programme under which the most comprehensive assessment of flood risk in the country to date is being undertaken.<br/><br/>The purpose of the CFRAM Programme is to:<br/><br/>- assess and map the existing and potential significant flood hazard and risk within the study areas,<br/><br/>- build the strategic information base necessary for making informed decisions in relation to managing flood risk,<br/><br/>- identify viable structural and non-structural measures and options for managing the flood risks for localised high-risk areas and within each river catchment as a whole. <br/><br/>There are three main stages in the Programme; each involving public consultation:<br/><br/>- Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment:  The Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) is a national screening exercise, based on available and readily-derivable information, to identify areas where there may be a significant risk associated with flooding.  These areas are referred to as Areas for Further Assessment, or &lsquo;AFAs&rsquo;.  The PFRA was completed in 2011, and 300 AFAs were identified nationally.  The PFRA will be reviewed by the end of 2018 and every 6 years thereafter.<br/><br/>- Flood Hazard Mapping:  This phase involves more detailed assessment of the AFAs to more accurately assess the extent and degree of flood risk and is undertaken through CFRAM Studies.  These Studies are well underway, and detailed flood maps are currently being consulted upon locally within the AFAs through a programme of Public Consultation Days which are advertised locally.  A national consultation on the flood maps will be undertaken in the Spring of 2015.<br/><br/>- Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans:  Where the risk of flooding is significant, the CFRAM progamme develops, where possible, measures to manage and reduce the risk.  Making use of the detailed assessments and flood maps, potential flood risk management measures are being assessed for the AFAs to determine viable and acceptable options for managing the flood risk within the AFAs, and such measures may include drainage works. The options will be taken to public consultation in the summer and autumn of 2015, with a view to preparing draft Flood Risk Management Plans by the end of 2015 that will set out the proposed strategies and measures for managing flood risk, and that will also be taken to consultation.<br/><br/>The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences on a systematic and objective basis using Multi-Criteria Analysis.  More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.<br/><br/>Pending the completion of the CFRAM Programme, the OPW is continuing with its programme of major flood relief schemes.  These schemes are focused on locations throughout the country where significant flood events have occurred in the past.  Cost benefit analysis is the standard methodology used to determine priorities and for selection of major schemes.  Benefits are measured in terms of the damage and loss avoided.  Details of major schemes are available on under Flood Risk Management.<br/><br/>The Office of Public Works continues to maintain Arterial Drainage Schemes which it carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This involves a total of 11,500 km of river channel and 800 km of embankments.  The annual maintenance programme is published by OPW on its website and typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on a five-yearly cycle.<br/><br/>OPW has no role in relation to urban storm water drainage.  This is a matter for the local authorities.<br/><br/>OPW has been allocated a total of &euro;225m for Flood Risk Management for the period 2012 - 2016.  This allocation will allow OPW to continue to progress its current programmes including major flood relief schemes, the Minor Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, the CFRAM Programme and  Arterial Drainage Maintenance.  </p></reply>

The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 2006 and 2010, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, place obligations on employers and employees to ensure that the risk of exposure to asbestos is eliminated or reduced to a minimum and that any remaining residual risk is adequately controlled in accordance with the legislation.  These Regulations are relevant to the matter of removal of asbestos.<br/><br/>In addition, national guidelines for the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials can be found on the website of the Health and Safety Authority (). <br/><br/>Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. The Regulations of 2006 and 2010 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work provide for the health surveillance of employees exposed to asbestos and for the maintenance of an occupational health register in relevant employments and for the maintenance by the Authority of an Asbestosis and Mesothelioma Register of diseases which have been reported to the Authority. The presence of asbestosis within the wider community is a public health matter. I am assured that patients suffering from asbestosis have access to the same range of diagnostic and treatment services provided in the public health system as other patients with chronic lung conditions. Accordingly, neither my Department nor the Authority has a role in relation to the removal of asbestosis in the community.  </p></reply>

They pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies &ndash; to support everyone with a good business idea and strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area. The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.<br/><br/>The LEOs themselves provide a range of financial and non-financial supports to help enterprises at start-up or during business expansion phases. It should be noted, though, that the LEOs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities. However, there are other non-financial supports available, such as mentoring and training, and the LEO staff can advise as to which supports would be most appropriate to your situation.<br/><br/>In addition, any business can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The Fund available to MFI has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal. Applications for the Microfinance Fund should be channelled through the local LEO. Further information can be found on the LEO website at <br/><br/>Businesses can also access the new online search tool for SME business supports that was launched last May. The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-governmental initiative to help Irish start-ups and small businesses navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.<br/><br/>By answering the eight questions in the Tool, a small business will, in one location be able to:<br/><br/>- Find out which of the over 80 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them<br/><br/>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit<br/><br/>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further<br/><br/>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use.<br/><br/>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at: <br/><br/>For enterprises starting up in County Wicklow, the contact details for the LEO Wicklow are: Wicklow County Campus, Clermont House, Rathnew, Co.

The allocation of mackerel has long been a contentious issue and this has been addressed by a comprehensive policy on the management of the stock. </p>  <p>  Prior to 2001, an allocation of 1,500 tonnes was set aside for polyvalent segment vessels out of the total national quota.  This was increased to a set amount of 7,000 tonnes and did not take account of changes in quota.  This changed in 2009, after a review, and a set percentage level was introduced to allow for increased allocations when the quota increased (or indeed reductions when the quota reduced). </p>  <p>  This policy provides that the Polyvalent Segment vessels are allocated 13% of the quota and  the RSW Pelagic Segment is allocated 87% of the quota.  The distribution of quota amongst the vessels in the RSW Pelagic Segment is made in accordance with long standing ratios based on historic vessel size which has been in place for many years.  The distribution of the quota for the Polyvalent segment vessels is made in accordance with Ministerial policy put in place in  2010.  Under this policy, mackerel allocations were made available to vessel owners based on track record from the two best years 2007, 2008, 2009.</p>  <p>  In terms of the allocation of quota between the RSW Pelagic segment vessels and the Polyvalent segment vessels, I do not consider that there are changed circumstances that would support a review of the allocations between the segments. I consider that the percentage based allocation between the segments can properly deal with year on year fluctuations in national quota in a fair, transparent and balanced way.  Any change in the current arrangements would be justified only if circumstances have changed since the 2009 review.  At that time, the Minister fully consulted with industry representatives on the issue and as a result was fully aware of the divergent views that prevailed within the industry at that time in relation to the management of this fishery. The specific management arrangements for the allocation of the mackerel quota introduced in 2009 were developed by the Minister for the proper and effective management of the mackerel fishing opportunities while at the same time fully cognisant of the divergent views that existed on the issue within various segments of the fishing industry.</p>  <p>  The quota available to the Irish fleet for 2015 amounts to 89,200 tonnes and authorisations for the 2015 fishery have been issued in accordance with the policy in place.</p></reply>

Contained therein is a stated business target that  visa applications to join Irish citizens should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application. A target of twelve months applies to  other applications for family reunification. However, it must be made clear that these are business targets for the immigration service. Accordingly, they in no way constitute legal obligations or convey any indication that a case not completed within the time-frame will in default of decision be resolved in the applicant&rsquo;s favour.</p>  <p>   These business targets reflect the detailed assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification and are qualified by availability of resources.  These targets are largely being met. Delays in achieving them are primarily related to more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested by my officials, or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required.</p>  <p>  The stated targets are being largely met despite a 58% increase in the number of visa applications from persons wishing to join an Irish citizen spouse/partner from 2010 to 2014. This can partly be attributed to the significant increase in grants of Irish citizenship since this Government took office.</p>  <p>  The management of resources is kept under constant review in my Department. While I am mindful of minimising the hardship on separated families as alluded to by the Deputy, I must balance the needs of this specific area of my Department with the requirements of other areas.</p></reply>

Another key task which is underway involves examining how the important issue of Reasonable Accommodation can be achieved in a meaningful way within our Constitutional framework as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  Progress towards ratification therefore continues to be made. One of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed is the enactment of capacity legislation. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will comprehensively reform existing legislation governing capacity and will provide a series of options to support people with decision-making capacity difficulties to make decisions and exercise their basic rights in line with the principles of the Convention. The Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p></reply>

A prisoner found to be in possession of a mobile phone is liable to be dealt with under the prison disciplinary system and the matter referred to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and possible prosecution.<br/><br/>My officials in the Irish Prison Service are currently considering a number of technologies with a view to blocking mobile phone signals in and out of prisons and for obvious security reasons, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot go into detail on the range of options and issues currently being considered.<br/><br/>Through a vigorous approach to screening and searching, the Operational Support Group continues to recover numerous mobile phones and components. The provision of mobile phone blockers would limit this activity and reduce the threat that it poses to society both inside and outside of prisons.<br/><br/>The measures currently in place to prevent the use of mobile phones by prisoners include metal detectors and other screening equipment at the point of entry to prisons, the use of active canine detection teams in recovering same from vehicles and buildings, as well as random and intelligence-led targeted searching of prisoners and locations within the prison Estate.<br/><br/>These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system. The number of mobile phones seized in prisons has reduced, year on year, since 2009, and the Deputy can be assured that the prevention of the smuggling of phones and other contraband remains a priority for the Irish Prison Service.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Mobile Phone Seizures 2010 to 2014 </b><table><tr><th><b>Prison/Place of Detention</b></th><th><div><b></b><br /><br /><b>2010</b></div></th><th><div><b></b><br /><br /><b>2011</b></div></th><th><div><b></b><br /><br /><b>2012</b></div></th><th><div><b></b><br /><br /><b>2013</b></div></th><th><div><br /><br /><b>2014</b></div></th></tr><tr><td><b>Arbour Hill</b></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Castlerea</b></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>42</div></td><td><div>29</div></td><td><div>43</div></td><td><div>38</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cloverhill</b></td><td><div>16</div></td><td><div>20</div></td><td><div>35</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>50</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Cork</b></td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>30</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>D&oacute;chas Centre</b></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>42</div></td><td><div>10</div></td><td><div>1</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Limerick</b></td><td><div>133</div></td><td><div>100</div></td><td><div>123</div></td><td><div>55</div></td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Loughan House</b></td><td><div>155</div></td><td><div>104</div></td><td><div>57</div></td><td><div>52</div></td><td><div>66</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Midlands</b></td><td><div>92</div></td><td><div>123</div></td><td><div>82</div></td><td><div>114</div></td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Mountjoy (Male)</b></td><td><div>742</div></td><td><div>420</div></td><td><div>336</div></td><td><div>238</div></td><td><div>223</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Portlaoise</b></td><td><div>18</div></td><td><div>27</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Shelton Abbey</b></td><td><div>88</div></td><td><div>77</div></td><td><div>86</div></td><td><div>19</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>St. Patrick's</b></td><td><div>138</div></td><td><div>220</div></td><td><div>278</div></td><td><div>119</div></td><td><div>109</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Training Unit</b></td><td><div>191</div></td><td><div>113</div></td><td><div>78</div></td><td><div>92</div></td><td><div>55</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Wheatfield</b></td><td><div>76</div></td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>21</div></td><td><div>22</div></td><td><div>44</div></td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><div><b>1,718</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,368</b></div></td><td><div><b>1,150</b></div></td><td><div><b>805</b></div></td><td><div><b>728</b></div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

This report represents a further important milestone in addressing concerns in relation to the operation of the penalty points system, and builds on the new Garda Policy on the operation of the Fixed Charge Penalty System (FCPS) which came into effect on 16 June, 2014.  The report recognises that significant improvements have been made, confirming that only the three persons authorised to cancel fixed charge notices under the new policy are in fact carrying out cancellations.  Furthermore, the impact of the new policy is evident in the reduction in the number of cancellations on discretionary grounds.</p>  <p>  It is the case, however, that the report has identified areas which require further attention and a series of recommendations are made to address these.</p>  <p>  A number of these relate to Garda operations and procedures and have been accepted by the Commissioner.  These include a proposal to establish a new Enforcement Unit within the Fixed Charge Processing Office to allow for more extensive enquiries to be made when considering whether to cancel a notice.  This will include additional scrutiny of cases where notices are returned.  Other system enhancements are also recommended, and accepted by the Commissioner.</p>  <p>  A further key recommendation, which has also been accepted is that, in order to maintain public confidence in relation to the operation of the FCPS, where an application for cancellation is made by a Garda to avail of the statutory exemption for emergency vehicles where the Garda is driving a private vehicle in the course of their duties, such applications would now be forwarded to the Office of the DPP for evaluation.</p>  <p>  The report also makes a number of recommendations with respect to legislative and related cross-cutting aspects of the fixed charge processing system, and I intend to refer these to the Criminal Justice (FCPS) Working Group for further examination.  This group was set up to take forward the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate on the FCPS and is jointly chaired by the Departments of Justice and Equality, and Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  I have also decided, again in the interests of maintaining public confidence in the system, to put in place a further assurance and oversight mechanism.  In particular, I have appointed Judge Matthew Deery, former President of the Circuit Court, to act as Independent Oversight authority for the FCPS cancellation process.  This role would be in addition to the ongoing internal audit of the system.  He would be free to inspect at random any fixed charge notice cancellation and report his or her findings on the operation of the system to the Minister. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that the Commissioner is forwarding the Report to GSOC, the CA&amp;G and the Garda Inspectorate.  The Garda Inspectorate had already indicated, as part of the recommendations in its March 2013 Report on the operation of the FCPS, that it intended to carry out a follow-up examination after 12 months, and this is expected to commence as indicated.</p>  <p>  I am determined that the progress and improvements recognised in the report will continue and will be further enhanced by these additional measures I have announced, so that the public can have confidence in the operation of the penalty points system.</p></reply>

Dublin, currently provide a total of 46 detention places for young people ordered to be remanded in custody or committed to serve a sentence of detention by the courts.  These comprise 6 places for girls up to the age of 18 on admission and 40 places for boys up to the age of 17 on admission.  Boys aged 17 on admission are currently accommodated by the Irish Prison Service.  This practice will cease, meeting the commitment in the Programme for Government to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities, with the new children detention facilities currently being constructed to extend the capacity of the Oberstown campus.  It is intended that this will provide sufficient accommodation for all children under 18 years of age ordered to be detained by the courts.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, pending introduction of the expanded facilities, the existing facilities at Oberstown are being used to meet demand from the courts.  The Irish Youth Justice Service of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs operates a twenty four hour bed management  service for children detention places, with the aim of having the maximum degree of coordination in this area. This service is available at all times to courts, the Probation Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to asssess the up to date position with regard to the availability of places. This is a demand led service and every effort is made to meet the needs of the courts in this area.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school. I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.</p>  <p>  In general terms, the HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  At a national level, a dedicated Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising representatives of my Department, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs plays a key role in fostering greater collaboration on children&rsquo;s disability issues and to build on the cross-sectoral working arrangements that are already in place.  A sub group of this Cross-Sectoral Team is examining the issue of the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, including supports for these children.  It is expected  to conclude its work shortly.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy  in respect of the individual case that he has raised.

Recent immigration and visa changes have been aimed at ensuring, in the first instance, that they support the recruitment of doctors from abroad to fill vacant posts. The revised arrangements enable doctors to be recruited on an agency basis, however they are aimed primarily at facilitating the filling of posts on a permanent basis. </p>  <p>  In July 2013 a Working Group was established, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures. The Group submitted its final report in June 2014. The final Report of the Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structures (3rd McCraith Report) stated &ndash; in relation to doctors in service posts in the acute hospital sector that:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Career structures and pathways for these doctors are limited. The Group recommends that processes are put in place by the HSE, as a matter of priority, to consider how best to address this issue, having due regard to the following: </p>  <p>  - The needs and requirements of the public health system, including service reconfiguration and integrated models of care;</p>  <p>  - Patient safety and quality of the patient experience;</p>  <p>  - Registration, qualifications and training, clinical governance, CPD and supervisory arrangements.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, is pursuing implementation of the recommendations made by the MacCraith Group to support NCHD and consultant recruitment and retention. </p>  <p>  We are currently finalising with the HSE a proposal for the re-grading of non-training NCHD posts to a Service Grade doctor post. This proposal will soon be issued to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for sanction.</p></reply>

This is the result of decades of political and economic mismanagement, exacerbated by difficult relations with neighbouring countries, ongoing violence in the Great Lakes region and chronic underdevelopment.</p>  <p>  I share the strong international concern at the violence during demonstrations in Kinshasa last week.  Demonstrators were protesting against proposed changes to the electoral law, which many believed would permit President Joseph Kabila to stay in office beyond his mandated two-term limit.  Reports indicate that some 36 people, including one police officer, were killed during the demonstrations in Kinshasa.  It is reported that the security forces were responsible for the deaths of at least 21 people.  Additionally, on 22 January, at least four people were killed during demonstrations in the eastern city of Goma.</p>  <p>  On 17 January, the Congolese National Assembly had adopted modifications to the electoral law that would require the holding of a national census ahead of the next election, a step that could significantly delay presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016.  On 23 January, the Congolese Senate adopted an amended version of the law, clarifying that the holding of elections would not be conditional on a census being completed and that the constitution&rsquo;s electoral timeframe would be respected.  If signed into law, the amended law would address a main concern of the protesters.</p>  <p>  I attended the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 19 January, just as the protests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were taking place.  We adopted Conclusions on the situation, which, while primarily addressing the ongoing civil conflict, also stressed the need for political action that will also build a long-term basis for stability.  Key to this is the organisation of credible and free elections.</p>  <p>  The violence has been widely condemned internationally, including by the Secretary General of the United Nations, who additionally called on all key stakeholders to resume political dialogue and ensure that issues relating to the elections are discussed in an inclusive and peaceful fashion in the appropriate forum.  Ireland fully supports this call. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s long engagement with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which dates back to its independence in 1960, continues today and we are a significant humanitarian donor in the region.  Since 2009, through Irish Aid, the Government has provided over &euro;44 million in humanitarian assistance for the people of the country, including through the work of the former UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region, Mary Robinson.  We are continuing to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

However, my Department has not prescribed that schools must use such journals or that they should contain specific information.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department, along with the Department of Health and the HSE, jointly published 'Well-Being in Post- Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention' in 2013. The guidelines provide practical advice to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated manner within the school environment. The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools were published at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The purpose of these procedures is to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. In that regard, the procedures recognise that a positive school culture and climate is the cornerstone for preventing bullying and the procedures contain provide practical tips for building such a positive culture and climate. Under the procedures, the Board of Management must also ensure that the school's anti-bullying policy is regularly highlighted and promoted on a school-wide basis with particular attention being given to incoming pupils and their parents. The procedures are not prescriptive in relation to how this should be done and it is open to schools to do so in the manner that best suits their individual circumstances. </p></reply>

This capacity is considered to be sufficient to meet the housing requirements nationally for in excess of the next ten years.<br/><br/>The challenge is to translate this potential supply line into actual construction on the ground to meet demand.  Most of the difficulties currently being encountered can be addressed by increasing the supply of properties available to buy, to rent, and to be provided by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.<br/><br/>The Government recognises that a whole of Government approach, working in close cooperation with key stakeholders, is the only way to tackle the challenge of increasing the supply of housing.  The implementation of the <i>Construction Strategy 2020</i>forms the basis for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  It provides for a strategic approach to the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues including the planning process, financing, access to mortgage finance, and developing the construction workforce.  <i>Construction 2020,</i>and two Planning Bills currently being drafted, aim to remove blockages from the system in order to support increased supply, reducing the pressure on house price growth and help ing homebuyers to acquire a family home in their community of choice at reasonable cost.<br/><br/>Measures to increase supply will also impact positively on the private rental sector.  Historically, the private rental sector has been characterised by small scale landlords.  Attracting large scale investment in professionally managed residential property, for example using Real Estate Investment Trusts and other options for long-term investment, has an important role to play in helping to deliver a more professional and higher quality sector.<br/><br/>Social housing is also a key priority for Government, as evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in Budget 2015 and the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014.  The Strategy builds on the provisions contained in Budget 2015 and sets out clear, measureable actions and targets to increase the supply of social housing, reform delivery arrangements and meet the housing needs of all households on the housing list.<br/><br/>The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 households on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  This will help to ease pressure on the private sector.<br/><br/>In 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided- 3,000 units through the leasing initiative; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be returned to use through a programme of refurbishment; a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and approved housing bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and the Capital Assistance Scheme; and a further 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units will be delivered.  In addition, 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<br/><br/>I will be continuing to assign the highest priority to the implementation of both <i>Construction 2020</i>and the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>.<br/><br/>As regards statistics on types of homebuyers over the last year, whilst my Department gathers and publishes a wide range of housing and planning statistics, the closest source of data to that requested by the Deputy is the Residential Property Price Register, which is produced by the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA) pursuant to section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and which is available at: .<br/><br/>The Register includes Date of Sale, Price and Address of all residential properties purchased in Ireland since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes.  However, the Register is not intended as a &quot;Property Price Index&quot; and does not record whether house purchases are made by family home buyers or investors.</p></reply>

Since 2010, the number of unfinished housing developments has decreased by approximately, two-thirds; from nearly 3,000 in 2010 to 992 in 2014.  It is expected that with the aid of the Special Resolution Fund (SRF), outlined further below, a further 74 developments should be resolved in the months ahead.  The SRF has already positively contributed to 12 developments inspected under the 2014 Annual Survey being removed from the list of Unfinished Housing Developments.  The detailed findings of the annual surveys, annual progress reports and other useful publications and information in relation to Unfinished Housing Developments are available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>As Minister for Housing and Planning and Coordination of Construction 2020, I now chair the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments.  The Committee comprises senior representatives of the key stakeholders, including the banking and construction industries, NAMA, local authorities, the Health and Safety Authority, residents and officials from my Department.  The Committee was established to drive and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of <i>&lsquo;Resolving Ireland&rsquo;s Unfinished Housing Developments &ndash; Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments&rsquo;</i>, published in May 2011.<br/><br/>The Committee has met on 13 occasions and has adopted a collaborative approach amongst its constituent members to promote the work of resolving the housing situation faced by residents of unfinished housing developments.  The Committee is scheduled to meet again on 10 February 2015.<br/><br/>The development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, have been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates.  The 2014 National Housing Survey shows that, of the 1,263 estates inspected, there were 587 estates going through the SRP process. This collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process.  For more information on Site Resolution Plans, please refer to section 3.4 of the Guidance Manual on Managing and Resolving Unfinished Estates, August 2011 &ndash;<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments.  The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers.<br/><br/>On 2 May 2014, allocations from the Special Resolution Fund were announced and 86 developments were approved for funding. The following link contains a list of all developments approved for SRF funding:<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>The management and administration of issues relating to unfinished housing developments is a matter for individual local authorities.  Each local authority has appointed an Unfinished Housing Development co-ordinator; contact details can be found on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at: .  </p></reply>

While an initial draft of the review was received from the Agency, a number of issues have been identified that need further detailed financial analysis in order to fully assess the impact on local authority finances of possible mitigating measures.<br/><br/>This substantial data collection project involving my Department, the Local Government Management Agency and the local authorities themselves is under way. It will be a number of months before sufficient data has been collected in order to complete the requisite analysis to finalise the review. <br/><br/>Pending full conclusion of this review, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities setting out some of the options and interim actions that might be explored to alleviate the difficulties of those in shared ownership distress, such as allowing use of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and room rental for Shared Ownership mortgage holders.  It is accepted that these proposals are not a complete solution to the issues that arise for such mortgage holders but are intended as an interim measure pending the outcome of the review.<br/><br/>My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014.  <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears: A Guide for Local Authorities</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:<br/><br/>.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-01-28a.342.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015012800076#WRF02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 131 together.<br/><br/>Ireland is on course to comply with its greenhouse gas emission reduction target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.  The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, which establishes a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol from 201 3 to 202 0, was agreed in 2012 but has not yet entered into fo rce.  Ireland has completed the necessary domestic acceptance procedures in relation to the Doha Amendment and will be in a position to formally accept it in the thirdquarter of 2015. <br/><br/>For each year between 2013 and 2020, Ireland has an ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC).<br/><br/>Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and specified that the target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the ETS and non-ETS sectors amounting to 43% and 30% by 2030 compared to 2005, respectively.  While the specific details of the contribution to be made by each Member State remain to be defined, the Council agreed that all Member States will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity.<br/><br/>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, published last week.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.<br/><br/>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low-carbon plan - the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures within the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the annual mitigation targets under the 2009 EU Effort-Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC) in the first half of the 2013-2020 compliance period.<br/><br/>However, there will be a significant compliance challenge in the years 2017-2020 and therefore the first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address this particular challenge in the years 2017 to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to be ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. It is also important to note that the Bill will provide for long-term successive planning in this respect.<br/><br/>2015 will also be a pivotal year in terms of the international response to climate change, with all 196 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change working to conclude a new global agreement in Paris in December.  The Paris outcome will build on existing agreements and chart a course for future global emissions reductions. Ireland, through the EU, will play its part in these negotiations and the globally agreed actions arising.  The October 2014, European Council commitment will be the basis of the EU &rsquo;sintended nationally-determined contribution to the new agreement.<br/><br/>On economic considerations, the National Policy Positionclearly identifies competitiveness as a pillar of the fundamental national objective on transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  The National Policy Position also sets out a number of key issues for consideration in the on-going evolution of national climate policy, including:<br/><br/>(i) the need to ensure that objectives are achieved at the least cost to the national economy and that any measures adopted to achieve those objectives are cost-effective, and do not impose an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer; and<br/><br/>(ii) the need to take advantage of environmentally sustainable economic opportunities both within and outside the State.<br/><br/>The <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>also includes provisions to statutorily underpin these and other key economic considerations, to be taken into account in the development of the mitigation and adaptation plans to be adopted by the Government for the purpose of progressing the national transition agenda.</p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.<br/><br/>The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<br/><br/>Downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter in some areas.<b></b>Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality, the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.<br/><br/>Nitrogen dioxide levels (NO<sub>2</sub>) levels showed a slight increasing trend in the years 2008 ‐ 2010. During this period, NO<sub>2</sub>levels were close to the CAFE limit value in Dublin and Cork cities, due primarily to traffic congestion.  However, NO<sub>2</sub>levels decreased from 2010-2012, and thereafter may have stabilised in 2013. To further reduce NO<sub>2</sub>levels in cities, we must develop and implement policies to reduce travel demand, emphasising sustainable transport modes such as cycling, walking and public transport and improving the efficiency of motorised transport.<br/><br/>In respect of monitoring of water quality, the EPA, local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Marine Institute all monitor rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters, and groundwater quality under the Water Framework Directive on a three-year cycle.  This extensive monitoring programme provides a good overview of current water quality and trends as they develop.<br/><br/>Water quality trends emerging in recent years include a notable decline in the incidence of serious pollution events from 39 sites in the 2004-2006 period, to 20 sites in the 2007-2009 period and currently down to 11 sites.  There has also been a stabilisation in the length of river channel regarded as unpolluted, at approximately 71% of the length surveyed. However, the period has also been marked by a steady decline in the number of river sites at high ecological status.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that a new national update for 2010-2012 will be available early this year. In the meantime, the EPA has published regional reports covering the south east, Louth/Monaghan and Galway/Mayo/Sligo, including information from 2012 monitoring.  The EPA and local authorities respond to water quality incidents and complaints on an on-going basis. Details of recent incidents are available on the EPA website and can be accessed at: .  Additional information is available at:.<br/><br/>Comprehensive reports on water quality are published every three years by the EPA and are available for download at .</p></reply>

There is free entry to the Irish oil market, no price control and it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice.  It is important to note that the Irish oil sector is completely privatised, liberalised and deregulated i.e. CER has no role in the oil market.<br/><br/>Oil is consumed in two sectors of the economy - in transport and heating.  The amount of oil used in the electricity sector is negligible at less than 1%.  In terms of gasoline and diesel prices at the pump and home heating prices, the Consumer and Competition Commission (under the aegis of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation) has a role in ensuring that the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged.  Previous investigations and surveys into oil prices, including home heating oil, have been undertaken by the National Consumer Agency (now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission), and these are available at .  The research indicates that the price paid by consumers is largely determined by taxation levels, the internationally traded price of crude oil and the consequent price at which refined product is traded in Europe, along with the level of competition in the retail market.<br/><br/>The European Commission maintains a Statistics and Market Observatory, which presents consumer prices and net prices (excluding duties and taxes) of petroleum products in EU Member States (known as the Oil Bulletin) on a weekly basis.  The Oil Bulletin is designed to improve the transparency of oil prices and to strengthen the internal market. The relevant link is: .  The latest bulletin from 19 January 2014 shows that diesel prices (including taxes) in Ireland were &euro;1.20 litre while gasoline prices (including taxes) were &euro;1.30 litre.  A year ago, prices in the euro area averaged &euro;1.40 per litre (including taxes) for diesel and &euro;1.56 per litre (including taxes) for gasoline.</p></reply>

The NBP will deal conclusively with rural connectivity issues so that current and future generations will have a guaranteed access to high quality, high speed broadband service.  This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.<br/><br/>The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in network upgrades in both the fixed and mobile segments of the market.  Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years.  These very significant investments, which include many parts of county Kerry, represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available.<br/><br/>On the 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched.  The map can be accessed at .  The areas on the map marked Blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016.  The areas marked Amber will require the intervention of the State. <br/><br/>The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises/home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by end 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention.  It also provides detailed information on over 50,000 townlands in every county in Ireland, including County Kerry.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30Mbps will be also delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.<br/><br/>In tandem with the mapping consultation, intensive design and planning work is underway in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy.  The strategy will address a range of issues in relation to the intervention including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. <br/><br/>My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the Plan over the next two years.  The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015.  The Intervention Strategy will be notified to the European Commission for State Aid clearance. <br/><br/>Following the public consultation, towards the end of this year a detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select preferred bidder or bidders.  The Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible.  It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016 with services being available incrementally as the network is rolled out. <br/><br/>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government.  It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.</p></reply>

The LNG facility would provide additional security of supply to Ireland in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  Such a facility would be a positive step for the island of Ireland.  While neither I, as Minister, nor my Department has any direct role in regard to the project, representatives of Shannon LNG have had meetings with my predecessor and with my officials to discuss various issues.
