In September 2020, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce submitted a Recovery Plan to me which sets out a number of recommendations, including a recommendation on enhancing sustainable employment, aimed at helping the tourism sector to survive and recover from the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Extending the wage support measures to June 2021 was an important step in assisting tourism businesses with staff retention. Funding of &euro;5 million was also provided to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in Budget 2021 for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p>  <p>  The Tourism &amp;amp; Hospitality Careers Oversight Group (COG), chaired by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is a collaborative approach by stakeholders, including Industry Bodies, Education Providers, Government Departments and State Agencies to addressing Skills Shortages in the Tourism Sector. The Group is currently finalising a new plan that takes into account recommendations from the Tourism Recovery Taskforce. A feasibility study of the proposed National Tourism Education Gateway has also been initiated. This week the Careers Oversight Group has organised a Recruitment for Reopening Webinar Event taking place tomorrow for tourism and hospitality businesses.  </p>  <p>  For their part F&aacute;ilte Ireland will run a social media campaign targeting job seekers when there is certainty around reopening. A schedule of targeted content will run through the summer on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s tourism careers website to push the job opportunities available. As part of its suite of Covid 19 business supports, F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides HR advice and practical information for businesses. From employee well-being to temporary closures, these tailored supports help focus on restoring stability to businesses and supporting their employees.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also created an extensive range of business supports to support Ireland&rsquo;s tourism and hospitality businesses to survive, re-open and recover from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  My colleagues, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD and Minister of State for Skills, Niall Collins TD recently announced two new skills programmes to assist hospitality and tourism sectors with COVID-19 challenges and ensure they are ready for reopening of the sectors.  Both programmes are aimed at assisting recovery and growth in the hospitality and tourism sector. </p>  <p>-   The Government recognises the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on tourism and hospitality and in the context of the National Economic Recovery Plan will consider further targeted measures to assist these sectors to recover.  </p></reply>

In preparation for such attendances, draft guidelines have been developed with the benefit of an excellent and ongoing engagement with the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA. These guidelines have been submitted to the public health authorities for their consideration. </p>  <p>  The next step is to schedule some test events, the timing of which is of course contingent on the prevalence of the virus. The Ferguson report offers the prospect of building on the good work already done with the sporting organisations concerned. </p>  <p>  I believe that we can start to pilot and to test events this summer. We would all like to see spectators back at, for example, one of the All-Ireland matches or a League of Ireland game this summer. I am positive and optimistic about that but we are not there yet. Antigen testing may play a key role, not only around sport but also third level education and other key areas of society that we want to see reopen and stay open.</p>  <p>  Accelerating over the summer months the resumption of sport overall is an important objective of the Government, including the holding of competitions, which many young people and adults have missed out on for many months. Safeguarding our physical and mental health is important and outdoor activity is being prioritised by Government.</p>  <p>It is necessary that we continue to be guided by health officials on how best to allow safe attendance at sporting and cultural events.  I can assure the Deputy that Minister Martin and I will continue our constructive and close engagement with the sports sector.</p></reply>

There has been an extensive engagement with the sports sector on a number of different levels, Ministerial, Departmental and also though Sport Ireland. Every few weeks, I chair meetings of the Covid-19 Sports Monitoring Group during which there is an excellent exchange of views with the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Sports Partnerships.  </p>  <p>  The Government is providing strong financial support for the sector. Last week, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;40 million to support the NGBs and LSPs which will help to encourage and support all concerned, young and old alike, to return to their sport of choice as the public health advice allows. This investment builds on the funding package of &euro;88.5m. allocated to sports organisations last year. We are currently working on the development of another support package. In addition, I hope to complete within the next few weeks a Sports Action Plan to cover the next three years which will contain a number of important measures to steer increased participation in sport.  </p>  <p>  I consider that the challenges being faced by young people to be a particular priority. In recent weeks I have held two separate, excellent consultations with young people from Galway, Dublin, Cork, Meath, Tipperary and Waterford. Areas such as access to facilities, transport issues, peer pressure, exam pressure and coaching standards were amongst the most prominent issues raised. </p>  <p>Subject to public health guidance, I intend holding an in-person event around this topic later this year where I hope those involved in providing sport for our young people can attend and listen to their needs.   </p></reply>

I established a Working Group to facilitate stakeholder consultation on the development of COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  This group had its first meeting on 21 April 2021.  The Live Entertainment Working Group includes stakeholders with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events and is will produce a set of overarching guiding principles which all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Arts Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland entered into a strategic partnership in order to develop guidance for the safe presentation of festivals and live events. This document is currently at the consultation stage and is due to be published in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  While the timeframe for the resumption of entertainment events remains uncertain and, is dependent on public health considerations, it is critical that a set of COVID-19 guidelines is developed and ready in advance of any re-opening of the sector.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to recently announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support the Live Entertainment Sector this year.  These include the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme.  Applications made under this scheme are currently being assessed and it is likely that many of the musicians, events, entertainment and culture workers will obtain work from promoters, producers and venues that receive funding under the LPSS.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I allocated &euro;14m to the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS). to provide the type of support sought by the Deputy.  It is aimed at businesses and individuals in the sector that have been unable to avail of other COVID-19 supports and that do not have a public facing premises.  The MEBAS will make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments of:-</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  I hope to open this scheme for applications shortly.  </p></reply>

A key support for visitor attractions and other tourism businesses has been the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) which was introduced to support businesses significantly affected by restrictions introduced to combat the pandemic.</p>  <p>  However, I recognise that not all tourism attractions, particularly those that are primarily outdoor, not for profit or have charitable status, qualified for CRSS, so the funding I secured  in Budget 2021 has allowed me to introduce further measures to assist the tourism sector. With that funding I was able to make support available to tourism businesses, including those visitor attractions, through the first Stage of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;55m Tourism Business Continuity Scheme.  The Scheme is contributing toward the fixed costs of tourism businesses that are not eligible for CRSS, to support their survival.   </p>  <p>  In addition to tourism-specific supports and the CRSS, other horizontal support schemes such as the EWSS and the Rates Waiver have been worth hundreds of millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors.  In line with the recommendations of the Recovery Oversight Group, the Government extended the economy-wide supports for businesses and employees until the end of June and has committed that there will not be a cliff edge end to the supports currently in place.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery.  As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will be outlining how it will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  The Government has said there will be no cliff edge in terms of supports and, along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. </p>  <p>  My department has regular engagement with the national representative association for the Visitor Experience and Attractions in Ireland (AVEA). I also recently met with the AVEA on April 12th discussing the safe reopening of attractions, supports, recruitment and working during COVID-19.</p></reply>

The guidance is, therefore,  a live draft document.</p>  <p>  I have held a series of online meetings with representatives of the households that provide accommodation to the students and a meeting was also held with the representative body of the Gaeltacht summer colleges, CONCOS, in order to hear their views and suggestions on the draft guidelines.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful to all those who participated in the consultation process.  It was important for me, as Minister of State and for my officials, to hear directly from  stakeholders about their concerns and it was clear that public health remains the primary concern of all.</p>  <p>  It remains to be seen whether the Irish Language Summer Colleges will be able to proceed this year due to the ever-changing COVID-19 situation and my Department continues to monitor developments in order to be able to make a final decision at an early date and in consultation with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  With regard to summer camps in the Gaeltacht, I am delighted personally, and of course for the Gaeltacht community, that out-door summer camps are likely to go ahead this year &ndash; with understandable restrictions in place in the interest of public health. My Department&rsquo;s Summer Camp Scheme provides an excellent opportunity for young people in the Gaeltacht to take part in enjoyable events together each summer in an environment in which Irish is spoken &ndash; which is of benefit to both the youth and to the Irish language. We all understand the unique challenges facing young people at present as a result of the pandemic and, as such, it is very important that the summer camp organisers follow the additional guidelines which are in place this year due to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The safety of the participants and staff is always of the utmost importance to my Department and, as such, will be monitored on an ongoing basis in the context of changing public health advice.</p></reply>

These include the reopening of outdoor visitor attractions, outdoor sports facilities and the return of underage non-contact outdoor training in pods of 15.</p>  <p>  As we come into the summer months more activity can take place outside.

The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. </p>  <p>  This is an exciting proposal and has been the subject of positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We can work now to see how it can be enhanced.  </p>  <p>  An oversight group has been established to deal with and examine how the pilot for artists can be done - and the Ministers within the relevant departments are supportive of this proposal being examined.   Any action on a pilot basic income scheme will not come solely from my Department.  Like many financial supports before and during the pandemic, a wider cohort in government must assess the strengths and weaknesses of any such scheme and any decision on how it is funded.  </p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine Universal Basic Income, informed by a review of previous international pilots, and resulting in a universal basic income pilot in the lifetime of the Government.</p>  <p>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the commitment in the Programme for Government and the Commission has agreed that this request will form part of its workplan for 2021.  The terms of reference for the study on Universal Basic Income are currently being finalised by the Commission and research is due to begin shortly.  </p></reply>

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. </p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types. This is an exciting proposal and has been the subject of positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We can now work to see how it can be enhanced.  </p>  <p>  I have established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the recommendations of Life Worth Living and particularly those which are outstanding.  The membership of the Group is drawn from departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations, and to whom recommendations of the Taskforce are addressed.  </p>  <p>  The Oversight Group is being chaired by my Department joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members and they will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association. </p>  <p>  I have asked the Oversight Group to prioritise the examination of Recommendation 1, a basic income for artists. I have engaged with relevant Ministerial colleagues on this matter and they have indicated their support for developing proposals. This would be independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the Programme for Government  commitment to pilot a Universal Basic Income within the lifetime of this Government commitment. I intend therefore to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine Universal Basic Income, informed by a review of previous international pilots, and resulting in a universal basic income pilot in the lifetime of the Government.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the commitment in the Programme for Government and the Commission has agreed that this request will form part of its workplan for 2021.  The terms of reference for the study on Universal Basic Income are currently being finalised by the Commission and research is due to begin shortly.</p></reply>

By the closing date, 3,106 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received. </p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment manual for the 2020 round has now been finalised and is available at www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie . Given the record number of applications and the detailed information contained in each application, the assessment process will take a number of months to complete.  It is envisaged that allocations to applications for equipment- only will be made first during the Summer with allocations to other capital projects announced before the end of the year.  Local and regional allocations will be announced at the same time.   </p>  <p>  In relation to larger projects, the National Sports Policy published in 2018 provided for the establishment of a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the SCEP. </p>  <p>Approximately &euro;86.4m of this allocation has already been awarded to 33 proposals and the priority in the short term is on advancing these projects. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF which is expected to be complete in the coming months. This review will consider, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded including to previously unsuccessful applications. The timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan.  </p></reply>

An independent Advisory Board, nominated by my Department was put in place to assist the management of the SFPA in the implementation of the Report. This Board is purely advisory and does not have any executive role in the operations of the SFPA. A dedicated Director of Transformation was appointed to the SFPA in January 2021, with overall responsibility for managing the implementation of the review&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations rests with the SFPA, which is an independent agency as set down in the 2006 Act. My role, as Minister, relates solely to corporate governance.</p>  <p>  The 2021 budget allocation of &euro;24.810m is to allow the SFPA to continue to meet its National and EU obligations as Ireland's competent Authority for the enforcement of Sea Fisheries and seafood safety law and to meet challenges arising from Brexit. This budget includes a provision of &euro;5.808m under EU- funded programmes for IT and other developments which previsously had been provided for in the general Department's budget.</p>  <p>  The additional funds have been allocated over recent years to strengthen the Authority. Staff numbers have increased from 104 in October 2017 to 150 in 2021. In addition, a programme of recruitment is planned for this year to provide for strengthened control and enforcement functions, including supporting the new requirements for seafood trade following the UK departure from the EU.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p>- The Tourism Recovery Taskforce;</p><p>- The Hospitality and Tourism Forum;</p><p>- The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce;</p><p>- The Sports Monitoring Group.</p><p>In addition to these groups I have established the Night-time Economy Taskforce and the Future of Media Commission, both of which are looking at longer term polices in respect of night time culture and media respectively.  </p><p>The Government's - The Path Ahead - plan particularly recognises the need for bespoke sectoral supports to address the worst impacted sectors in the forthcoming National Economic Recovery Plan. </p><p>I am resolved to continue to work with stakeholders across my sectors to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors not just during this pandemic, but into the all-important recovery phase which will follow it.</p><p>There has already been some key changes for the sports and tourism sectors in April. These include the reopening of outdoor visitor attractions, outdoor sports facilities and the return of underage non-contact outdoor training (which includes dance) in pods of 15.</p><p>As we come into the summer months more activity can take place outside. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme, which is being delivered in partnership with the local authorities, aims to develop outdoor dining capacity nationwide with a budget of &euro;17million.  &euro;5m is also being allocated by my Department to local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances in summer 2021, animating town centres for local communities, should public health considerations permit.  It will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. </p><p>Over the coming months, as the restrictions ease and the vaccine programme is rolled-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society, and with it our Tourism sector, our Arts and Culture venues and events, and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sportsgrounds.</p></reply>

It works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs. The WFP plays a significant role in the UN&rsquo;s global campaign for Zero Hunger (Sustainable Development Goal 2) and is at the forefront of dealing with the migration crisis. For its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.   </p>  <p>  My Department leads on Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the WFP, which is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the WFP, expressed through three-yearly Strategic Partnership Agreements, was &euro;70million for the period 2019-2021. My Department is currently leading on the preparations for the next SPA (2022-2024). This contribution will help save lives and support food security and nutrition and rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings and it reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s role as one of WFP&rsquo;s most engaged partners.  Ireland also chairs Friends of Nutrition, an informal space where Member States and the World Food Programme can come together to discuss the shared ambition for nutrition. Also, my Department represented Ireland at the WFP Executive Board in 2018 and 2019 as part of the rotating board membership. Ireland will sit on the Board again in 2023.</p></reply>

I established the Live Entertainment Working Group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and develop COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  The Group includes stakeholders from across the live entertainment sector as well and those with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events.  The Group will produce a set of overarching guiding principles that all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes. It is chaired by my Department and had its first meeting on 21 April 2021. The Live Entertainment Working Group includes stakeholders with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events and is will produce a set of overarching guiding principles which all venue promotors can adopt for their specific purposes. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Arts Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland entered into a strategic partnership in order to develop guidance for the safe presentation of festivals and live events. This document is currently at the consultation stage and is due to be published in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  While the timeframe for the resumption of entertainment events is dependent on public health considerations, it is critical that a set of COVID-19 guidelines is developed and ready in advance of the re-opening of the sector.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to recently announce a new &euro;50 million suite of additional measures to further support the Live Entertainment Sector this year. As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports. </p>  <p>  The new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments of:-</p>  <p>   ?&euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>   ?&euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  I hope to open this scheme for applications shortly.  </p></reply>

The Government has placed the draft Bill on the priority list for publication in the Summer 2021 legislative session.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Joint Oireachtas Committee has commenced pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Bill including oral hearings beginning on 13 April 2021. The timeline for this work is a matter for the Committee.</p>  <p>  The Bill will establish a multi-person Media Commission, including an Online Safety Commissioner. The role of the Commissioner will be to oversee a regulatory framework for online safety.</p>  <p>  This will be done through binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. The defined categories of harmful online content include criminal material, serious cyberbullying material and material promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. </p>  <p>  There is also provision in the Bill for further categories to be defined, subject to extensive consultation, a proposal from the Media Commission and Oireachtas approval. In order to make such proposals, the Commission will have a general role in researching and taking stock of the prevalence of potentially harmful kinds of content online. In carrying out this role, the Commission will engage with academics, industry and other relevant stakeholders, including through advisory committees.</p>  <p>  It is, however, important to note that, while this Bill is both important and timely, it is only one of a number of initiatives at Irish and European level that will tackle harmful online content. This includes the regulation of the transparency of online political advertising through the Electoral Reform Bill and the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation, which is currently being revised as part of the European Democracy Action Plan.  Disinformation will also be addressed in the forthcoming Digital Services Act, currently being negotiated at European level, which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading in respect of Ireland. </p></reply>

This engagement enables an effective exchange of views on all matters concerning the impact of the pandemic on sport, including the importance of recommencing sport for all age groups at the earliest possible date.  The Government will meet before the end of the week to consider the next phase of the reopening based on public health advice and taking account of the engagement with the sector.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as attendance by spectators at sporting events is concerned, we will continue to be guided by health officials on how best to allow safe attendance at such events. Under the Government&rsquo;s Living with Covid-19 plan, spectators are permitted to attend sporting events in limited numbers when the relevant area of the country is at Level 1 or at Level 2. As the country is currently at Level 5, no spectators are permitted at sports matches or events.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure effective preparation for the safe return of spectators, draft guidelines have been developed for very large purpose built event facilities such as sports stadia. This guidance has been submitted to the public health authorities for their consideration, which is awaited. </p>  <p>  The next step is to schedule some test events. However, the precise timing for such events is contingent on the prevalence of the virus and the prevailing public health situation. I am optimistic that some test events can be undertaken in the relatively near future over the summer period.  While it may play in role in the return of spectators, the widespread use of antigen testing across society and the economy is a matter for Government.</p></reply>

The Recovery Oversight Group will keep me apprised of progress with regard to implementation of the Recovery Plan and the recovery of the sector more generally. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the Recovery Plan includes a recommendation to develop a Global Invitation Programme to stimulate additional international demand. Whilst the tourism sector is still navigating the survival stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is also important to ensure that we plan for recovery. Officials within the Department, along with the tourism agencies, are currently examining what type of project would best support the recovery as well as an appropriate timeframe for such an initiative.</p>  <p>With regard to aviation, I should clarify that while the sector is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of our tourism sector, the responsibility for Aviation and recovery in that area falls to my colleague, the Minister for Transport.   </p></reply>

Public information campaigns played a vital role in communicating the various strands of the pandemic. The campaigns informed citizens of all stages of restrictions as they were introduced and subsequently lifted.  Public information campaigns were also used to communicate with citizens on the supports being made available by Government to get through the pandemic.  Campaigns included information on business and wellbeing supports, postponement of Leaving Cert 2020, School Reopening and the Jobs Stimulus Plan.  Campaigns also encouraged the key behaviours necessary to control the virus. Campaigns communicated the Reopening plan in the Summer of 2020 and the National Framework for Living with Covid-19.</p><p>The scale of the communications challenge faced by Government was unprecedented, requiring public information campaigns across every sector of the economy and society.</p><p>The communications strategy for Covid-19 required national and international coordination.  A series of coordinated campaigns were developed to ensure maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community.The strategy aligned with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasised the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals.This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns using national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms. The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences. </p><p>The communications programme recognises the importance of ensuring as many people as possible receive the information they need in the format that suits them, using the appropriate channels and delivered in the appropriate way. They also understand that, for example, when trying to encourage particular behaviours that will protect communities and the health service, certain groups receive communications in different ways. The campaigns utilise platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.</p><p>The AntiViral campaign has been particularly effective. Following a significant increase in case numbers among 18-24 year olds in the autumn of 2020, GIS, the Department of Health and the HSE engaged with representative groups to understand the needs of this demographic. Insight generated from the research these groups had conducted confirmed that young people had been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, were concerned about it and its impact upon them and their loved ones.</p><p>It also revealed that they wanted this to be recognised and that they wanted information to be given to them in the appropriate way, by their peers. Taking this insight, we worked with an agency with a track record of communicating with this demographic and developed Antiviral &ndash; a campaign that encouraged this group to assume a leadership role in dealing with the pandemic, generating a movement they could relate to and that was delivered by their peers. The campaign continues to be very successful, utilising platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. The campaign has evolved based on feedback from young people and the current strand of the campaign features the stories of young people who have been directly affected by the virus.</p><p>This campaign achieved overall impressions and reach of 18.8m and 1.48 million respectively. Engagement (a key metric as it indicates content that has resonated with an audience, causing them to actively interact with the content) has been striking, with an overall engagement of 288,787. On TikTok the level of engagement was 21%, far in excess of the industry standard of 6%. On Instagram, engagement was 36% again a notable achievement given the standard of between 3-5%.</p><p>In <b>2020</b>there was an expenditure of &euro;16.9 million on providing information to the public, across a range of platforms, on the various Covid-19 restrictions as they were implemented, the wide range of business supports, social welfare supports and community supports available and targeted measures. </p><p><b>In 2019,</b>the spend included &euro;12,000 on online advertising, and &euro;17,000 on video and radio ad production. My Department paid for public information campaigns relating to Budgets 2019 and 2020, for public consultation notices for draft language schemes, and for the &lsquo;<i>Votail100</i>&rsquo; commemorations.  There was also expenditure for advertisements relating to the recruitment of Judges.</p><p><b>In 2018</b>, the &euro;1.6m spend was across online, print, broadcast advertising, and production costs. The spend related to major cross-Government public information campaigns that the Department funded centrally.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.230.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800083#WRE03875"><p>Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy, Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. IDA Ireland is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. The IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.</p>  <p>  Cork and Kerry make up the South West Region and has 211 client companies which collectively employ 46,009 people, while Clare and Limerick (along with Tipperary) are included in the Mid-West Region with 131 client companies employing 19,989 people.</p>  <p> The primary responsibility of the IDA is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Ireland and to retain, transform and expand the existing base of client companies that have already invested and located here.</p>  <p>  When it comes to FDI site visits represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p>  <p>  2020 presented undeniable challenges to ongoing efforts to sustain and grow FDI in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world disrupted the usual way the IDA engaged with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  In response to this, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities onto digital platforms and established a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The use of these digital platforms has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients, and in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.  </p>  <p>  The number of site visits, including E-visits, to end 2020 was: Limerick 26; Clare 16; Cork 30 and Kerry 1. Verified figures for end Q1 2021 are expected before the end of the month.  It should also be noted that potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. These figures represent individual visits and are therefore not indicative of the number of companies that have visited.</p>  <p>  As part of the IDA&rsquo;s Strategy Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-24, IDA have set out proposed office solutions for regional locations, which will enable the IDA to attract further FDI to these locations. For example, in the South-West region IDA will deliver an Advanced Building Solution in Tralee over the life of the Strategy, while continuing to work closely with the private sector in the South-West to secure the provision of appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions for client companies.  Additional upgrade works, and investment are planned for IDA Parks in the region to ensure a robust value proposition for clients, and IDA plans to acquire additional strategic sites for future development. IDA will target 118 investments for the South-West region in the period 2021-2024.</p>  <p>  The final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.   Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect IDA Ireland continues to engage with stakeholders as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to sustain and generate additional jobs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Terms of Reference for the Shannon Estuary Taskforce, encompassing parts of north Kerry and other areas mentioned in his question, are being finalised and I hope to make an announcement in that regard shortly</p></reply>

For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders, and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. The CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase by consumers of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). </p><p>The CCPC has engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish property purchasers. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by Irish property purchasers, the CCPC has passed these on to DGCCRF and taken whatever additional steps requested by DGCCRF. </p><p>The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the individuals involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF. The CCPC considers this matter as a high priority issue and one which we have dedicated considerable resources to. When DGCCRF have completed their investigation, the DGCCRF will provide to the CCPC, information on any potential concerns or infringements with respect to Irish agents identified during the course of their investigation. At that point, the CCPC will assess the information provided by the DGCCRF in order to determine whether there may have been a breach of consumer protection legislation by Irish traders. Following any such assessment, the CCPC will decide the necessary next steps.</p><p>In relation to the question of mortgages being sold by an unlicensed mortgage provider, there is limited information in the PQ to provide a comprehensive response. However, generally, I would point out that  the authorisation of mortgage providers is a matter more appropriate to the Central Bank. Given the context of the query, it is also not clear whether the mortgage provider in question was an Irish operator or operating outside of the jurisdiction. The Central Bank may be able to provide further information in relation to the requirements of mortgage providers and the consequence of operating without a license. If the mortgage provider was based in another jurisdiction, the Central Bank may also be in a position to advise who the relevant financial regulator might be. The Central Bank has a page on its website where unauthorised firms can be reported. Link - <i></i>.</p></reply>

The NBP High Speed Broadband Map is dynamic. This means that the intervention area can be updated to reflect new commercial plans, or previous plans that have failed to materialise. This flexibility allows for an increase or decrease in the number of premises included in the State Intervention area.

Solar energy projects were a key part of the success of the recent RESS 1 auction and the Programme for Government commits to building on this success by ensuring that a greater share of our electricity needs are met through solar power.</p>  <p>  The RESS has been designed to deliver renewable energy projects to the grid at least cost to consumers by driving strong competition. Assessing the wider system costs of technologies  is key to driving the best outcome for consumers and therefore a balance must be struck between de-risking investment for developers and allocating risk to the market. The RESS received state aid approval from the EU Commission in July 2020 and auctions held under the scheme must operate within the framework of the state aid decision.</p>  <p>  Connection charges to the transmission system is a matter for the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) while planning permission for solar projects is a matter for the relevant planning authority. Responsibility in relation to commercial rates, including for solar energy projects, is a matter for the relevant rating authorities in accordance with the valuation methodology determined by the Valuation Office.</p>  <p>  While no decisions have been made on the detailed design of the second RESS onshore competition, all stakeholders will have the opportunity to provide feedback on the design of the scheme through the consultation process on the draft terms and conditions. </p>  <p>  A timetable will be published in the coming months which will set out the key milestones in the competition including consultation on the terms and conditions, the qualification process and the auction bidding window.</p></reply>

EirGrid and ESB Networks are regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which also has responsibility for the setting of grid connection policy.</p>  <p>  The principle applied by the CRU in this regard is cost appropriateness, which means the generator pays their costs to connect to the network. The approach to grid connection costs may vary in other European countries but usually depends on a number of factors, including generation mix along with the resilience and interconnection of electricity networks.</p>  <p>  As regulator, the CRU reviews the procedures for setting grid connection costs and reviews the costs that the system operators apply for strengthening the grid. As part of the CRU's recent Price Review 5 decision which covers the system operators' costs for the next five years, a total of &euro;4bn has been committed to capital expenditure for EirGrid and ESB Networks. This will enable the system operators to strengthen the grid and ensure that the grid can accommodate increasing levels of renewable power in line with the commitments in the Climate Action Plan to have 70% renewable electricity on the system by 2030. </p>  <p>  EirGrid is currently undertaking a &ldquo;Shaping our Electricity Future&rdquo; consultation across the three dimensions of electricity networks, power system operation, and electricity markets with the aim of developing an integrated all-island vision of the 2030 power system and electricity market.</p></reply>

As set out in the Programme for Government, ensuring access to high-quality internet connections for people across Ireland is essential to the development of all parts of our country, socially and economically. I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>The level of connectivity to support digital activity has improved significantly in recent years with Ireland&rsquo;s rank in the EU Digital Economic Society Index (DESI) Score Card improving to 6th overall. Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for fixed and mobile, with a considerable level of continuing investment, which has significantly enhanced the availability of services (both voice and data). ComReg has published a Coverage Map which shows ComReg&rsquo;s predicted mobile outdoor coverage across Ireland and at specific addresses and/or Eircodes selected by consumers for all Mobile Service Providers. It is available at  . This resource can be of assistance to citizens in identifying which network would best suit their needs.</p><p>ComReg is currently managing a licensing process through which telecoms operators can gain access to additional spectrum with a view to providing enhanced services to consumers. This spectrum award process includes specific provisions aimed at further improving coverage where people need it most. </p><p>  In addition to commercial investment, so as to ensure that nobody is left behind in a digital divide, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the areas which will be included in the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. 62,470 premises in total in County Waterford, of which 47,470 (76%) premises are served by commercial operators and 15,000 premises (42%) will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention. Government investment in County Waterford under the National Broadband Plan will amount to &euro;59m.</p><p>As of 22 April 2021, over 207,000 premises across 26 counties have been surveyed which is ahead of schedule. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new Fibre to the Home network to these premises and substantial design work is underway. Over 11,000 (73%) premises in the Intervention Area have been surveyed in County Waterford including in the areas of Ballinakill, Cheekpoint, Waterford City, Passage East, Kilmeaden, Dunmore East and Tramore. The areas of Seanphobal and An Rinn, Co. Waterford are located in the Dungarvan Intervention Area and will receive access to high speed broadband as part of the NBP. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Waterford through the NBI website www.nbi.ie which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates.Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 22 April 2021, 304 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. In County Waterford, BCP sites at Knockamore, Ballysagart, Mondeligo and Mount Mellarey are now connected by NBI. Further details can be found at . </p><p>Whitechurch National School, Faithlegg National School, Saint Mary's National School and Ballycurrane National School are connected by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative. School BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use only through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education. An acceleration of this aspect of the project was announced in December last which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

The Bill establishes a clear relationship, and a requirement for consistency, between these policy instruments and the national climate objective.  Local Authorities will also be required to produce individual Climate Action Plans. </p>  <p>  While I am not in a position to advise on examples in other legislation, the intention of the &lsquo;limitation of liability&rsquo; provision set out in section 4 of the Bill is to provide that there will be no entitlement to remedy or relief by way of damages or compensation for any failure to comply with the Act or any breaches of obligation thereunder. This inclusion of this clause seeks to limit punitive financial compensation being sought which would limit the State&rsquo;s ability to fund climate action. However, no other remedy is affected and the obligations in the 2015 Act, and those set out in this Bill when enacted, may be litigated before the Courts. If the Government or any public body fail to deliver on their required obligations, it is open to pursue such matters before the Courts.</p>  <p>  The second stage debate on the Bill commenced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 21 April and this stage is expected to conclude this week.

Two strands of funding are available:</p>  <p>  - an open call &ndash; to organisations, NGOs, charities, enterprises, institutions and collectives/networks working with creative and cultural practitioners; and</p>  <p>  - a closed call &ndash; to Local Authorities, either individually, with other Local Authorities or external partners.</p>  <p>  Further information, including a briefing note and details on how to apply, are set out on the Creative Ireland website: www.creativeireland.gov.ie </p></reply>

It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to produce a Climate Action Plan, covering both mitigation and adaptation. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other in their preparation.</p><p>In 2018, my Department entered into a five year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs). The CAROs played a key role in coordinating the development of Local Authority Local Adaptation Strategies published in 2019. Each CARO is now working with the Local Authorities in its region to both facilitate and monitor implementation of the local climate adaptation actions within the strategies.  My Department is also funding and working with the CAROs in relation to the implementation of a Local Authority climate action training programme to build the necessary capacity in the sector, increasing climate change knowledge and supporting climate action by all Local Authorities.  The training will facilitate effective climate mitigation and adaptation actions at local level. The CAROs will continue to provide support to the Local Authorities on climate action. My Department engages regularly with all four CAROs, in particular through participation in the National Local Authority Climate Action Steering Group.</p></reply>

The first phase of their two planned wind farms will be commissioned by 2028 subject to the appropriate consents and success at relevant auctions. This will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s target of at least 5GW of Offshore Wind connected to the grid by 2030 and once complete, the wind farm will be capable of powering more than 1.6 million homes in Ireland. Construction of an offshore windfarm is a highly specialised activity that includes both onshore and offshore activities.  Based on similar projects elsewhere, ESB estimate that employment during construction will be close to 600 people.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, ESB assess all available technologies for technical and commercial feasibility.

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 22 April 2021, over 207,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. In County Kerry, premises have been surveyed including in the areas of Muckross, Fossa, Kilcummin, Lissivigeen, Ballycasheen, Faha, Firies, Ballyhar,Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert. Surveys are underway in Rathmore, Knocknacopple, Mounthorgan, Kilquane Upper, Barraduff, Cloonteens, Gneevgullia, Tureenamult, Renasup, Castlegregory, Aughacasla, Camp, Knockbrack, Maum, Lougher, Inch, Annascaul, Derrygorman, Ballyglasheen, Brackluin, Ballintarmon, Drom, An Clochan, Kilshannig, Fahamore, Candeehy Breanainn, Ballyheigue, Glenderry, Ladywell, Banna, Lerrig, Ballymacandrew, Causeway, Foxfort, Ballymacaquinn, Ballincloher, Dromartin and Beenconeen.  Build works have started in the areas around Tralee in Curraheen, Abbeydorney, Kilflynn, Firies, Castlemaine and Ardfert. Pre-build works in the Killarney area have also commenced.</p><p>The premises referred to is in the Kilfenora deployment area and I am advised by NBI that access to high speed broadband will be available in the area later this year. Further details are available on specific areas within County Kerry through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 22 April, 304 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for schools. BCP sites installed in Kerry are Gneeveguilla, Railway Station Heritage Centre and Community Space, Inch Community Centre, Kielduff Community Centre and Cill&iacute;n Liath. Cable Station and Chapeltown Community Centre are installed and connected. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Boheeshil National School, Dunloe Upper and Coars National School are installed as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

The better information provided by smart meters will enable consumers to reduce consumption and utilise higher amounts of electricity &ndash; increasingly from renewable sources - at off peak times. Smart meters will also facilitate the development of microgeneration, smart grids and the increasing electrification of transport and heating.</p>  <p>  The National Smart Metering Programme is co-ordinated by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) with ESB Networks delivering the electricity meter rollout. Over 250,000 meters have been installed to the end of March 2021 since the rollout of over 2 million electricity meters commenced in September 2019. Customer satisfaction with the rollout remains very high with the vast majority of customers accepting the meter exchange. </p>  <p>  My Department is very cognisant of the need for security in relation to smart metering data, including appropriate access to data and data privacy rights. In that regard, ESB Networks has submitted a comprehensive Data Protection Impact Assessment on the Smart Metering Programme to the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) and CRU have had extensive engagements with DPC officials in the development of the programme.

Accordingly, a budget of &euro;32.1 million in capital and operational supports has been being made available to these airports in 2021</p>  <p>  In this regard, I was pleased to recently announce a specific capital allocation for Shannon Airport of &euro;6.3 million.  This funding, which will support the delivery of a broad range of projects at the airport, is in addition to &euro;6.1m already approved for a significant Hold Baggage Screening project in 2020.  Later in the year, Shannon Airport will also be invited to apply for operational supports from a programme budget of &euro;15.6m.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 24 February 2021, my Department secured European Commission approval for a &euro;26 million funding package for Irish Airports consisting of a &euro;20 million damages measure for State airports, including Shannon.  The aim of this measure is to provide airports with the flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity when circumstances allow.  It is anticipated that this funding will be provided on a proportionate basis relative to the number of passengers at each State airport in 2019.</p>  <p>  All eligible airports, including Shannon Airport, were invited to apply for aid under this measure on 26 March.

This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles;</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers; and </p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points.</p><p>The project is due to be completed in 2022.  Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at </p><p>In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the number of charge points provided by county, I have forwarded the Deputies' questions to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>In addition to the ESB project, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do</p><p>not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. To date no chargers have been installed by local authorities under the scheme. The SEAI has, however, received requests from 13 local authorities for applications</p><p>under the scheme and two completed applications from Louth County Council and Dublin City Council to install a total of 29 charge points within their administrative areas. These applications are currently being assessed for approval. </p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p><p>Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.</p><p>On new builds, it should be noted that the EU energy performance and buildings directive requires member states to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings as well as those buildings with more than ten car parking spaces for the purpose of enabling the installation of a larger stage of charging points for electric vehicles. This is currently being transposed into Irish law.</p></reply>

Funding under CEF is delivered in the form of grants allocated following competitive calls for proposals. Funding rates vary depending on the call for proposals and the type of project, generally ranging from 20% to 50% of eligible costs. </p>  <p>  With regard to projects that support the transport sector to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, in the programming period 2014 &ndash; 2020, Gas Networks Ireland has been awarded in excess of &euro;18 million towards two projects focussed on developing a network of CNG stations on Ireland&rsquo;s TEN-T core road network. There are currently a number of stations in operation, including in Dublin Port and in Cashel. The projects also involve vehicle grant schemes for Heavy Duty Vehicles to incentivise uptake in the sector and the building of renewable gas injection facilities around the country.</p>  <p>  While the drawdown of EU funding provided under the CEF programme is not readily available by year, further details on these projects and all Irish CEF transport projects are available on the website of the EU's Innovation and Networks Executive Agency at the following link:</p>  <p>  https://ec.europa.eu/inea/sites/inea/files/cefpub/eu_investment_in_transport_in_ireland.pdf </p>  <p>  A new CEF programme will be implemented in the period 2021 - 2027 with an anticipated budget of &euro;11.3 billion for transport under the general envelope, open to all Member States. It will support the goals of the Commission&rsquo;s Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy (December 2020) laying the foundation for how the EU transport system can achieve its green and digital transformation and become more resilient to future crises. As outlined in the European Green Deal, the result will be a 90% cut in emissions by 2050, delivered by a smart, competitive, safe, accessible and affordable transport system. It will also prioritise environmentally friendly modes such as rail and the development of charging points for vehicles using alternative fuels.</p>  <p>  A three-year CEF work programme covering calls for proposals from 2021 - 2023 is currently being finalised, which will set out the indicative budgets and types of eligible projects that can apply for grants. Final details will  confirmed in the coming weeks once discussions at EU level conclude. It is expected that the first call for proposals will be launched in Q3 of 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number further potential options for utilising EU funding opportunities in support of the decarbonisation of transport. My Department is reviewing the potential for sustainable public transport projects, as part of the wider Government plans for availing of funding under the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility in line with the European Green Deal and the concept of competitive sustainability.  </p>  <p>  The new PEACE PLUS Programme 2021-2027, which will build upon previous PEACE and INTERREG Programmes, will provide opportunities under the EU policy objective of &ldquo;a more connected Europe&rdquo;, contributing to the cross-border economic and territorial development of the region. In this regard, there has been significant bilateral engagement between my Department and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, to examine potential sustainable transport projects that fit the PEACE PLUS criteria.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department continues to examine all funding opportunities and mechanisms to support the transport sector in Ireland to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to review how we can leverage European Investment Bank funding and other opportunities for external funding to the maximum extent possible to support our recovery and transition to a low carbon future.</p></reply>

This increase in funding will not only support the construction and improvement of walking and cycling infrastructure but also the deployment of almost 250 Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that local authorities can also access funding sources through other Departments to support walking and cycling infrastructure development. The two most significant are the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), which falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), overseen by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The latter Department also supports leisure orientated walking and cycling through the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS).</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the delivery of safe and connected active travel infrastructure in order to encourage behavioural change and increase the number of those who choose to walk and cycle regularly as part of their daily routine. The step-change in funding committed in Budget 2021 is proof of this commitment and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects around the country which will be in receipt of the increased funding allocation. </p></reply>

Accounting for a little over one fifth of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, there can be no question, but that transport must feature strongly in contributing towards the national decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Development Plan (NDP) underpins all State investments. The NDP is currently undergoing review, as such, the scale of investment in the transport sector is also being reassessed. Meanwhile, my Department recently launched the National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland for public consultation, seeking views on investment priorities and ensuring transport investment is aligned with the Government&rsquo;s overarching objectives. In addition, through the development of the forthcoming Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2021, significant analytical and modelling work is underway to identify the cost of delivery of the various measures required to achieve a 51% reduction in national emissions by 2030, as has been committed to in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  In advance of finalising CAP 2021 it is difficult to attribute meaningful costs to sectoral emission savings. Nevertheless, what is clear is there will be significant costs, and the extent of these and the question of where they fall, will be strongly determined by precise type of mitigation action taken, the scale of the action and the timing of its deployment. Analysis previously undertaken by my Department suggests that there are a variety of different ways of achieving an indicative 1% reduction in transport emissions, each with significantly different corresponding cost. For example, it was estimated that replacing c.57,000 older combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles could yield approximately a 1% emission savings at a cost to the State of c.&euro;630m if there were continuation of current subsidy levels. A 100% increase in rail passenger kilometres or a 300% increase in bus passenger kilometres could also respectively mitigate 1% of transport emissions. Both of those potential measures would require significant capital investment in the region of &euro;3-5 billion as well as additional annual current funding for operating costs. This analysis is indicative only and the corresponding costs are approximations, and it should be noted that the costs of potential measures would vary over time, often in line with changes in technological development and market forces. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are continuing to work with colleagues across Government in preparing the forthcoming CAP 2021, and I expect that the agreement of that Plan and of the direction of future measures will provide greater clarity on the expected costs associated with reducing transport emissions in line with the national climate objective.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.  </p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Government, supported by the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base.  </p>  <p>  There are 11 commercial and 8 non-commercial agencies under the remit of my Department.  I have forwarded the Deputies question to each agency for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p>  <p>  In addition, there are 27 vehicles registered to my Department, all of which are run on diesel or petrol. It should be noted that this data was extracted from the National Vehicle and Driver File database and as such is not an asset list. </p>  <p>  Many of these are vehicles which have specific requirements owing to the nature of the work they are deployed to assist, such as heavy equipment transportation or emergency response, which may make replacing them with an electrically fuelled alternative impossible or significantly more expensive.  When vehicles fall to be replaced, my department will replace them with electrically powered alternatives, where the cost and suitability of the vehicles for the purpose required allows.</p>  <p>  The work of Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce, established by my two Departments to consider a full suite of potential measures available to Government, concentrated on EVs and, as part of this work, the important leadership role that Public Bodies and Government Departments can play in encouraging LEV uptake was considered. The Taskforce recommended the introduction of a new public procurement framework for EVs by 2020 and this recommendation was echoed in the Climate Action Plan where Action 149 was to "enable the deployment of electric vehicles in public sector fleets". </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement has drawn up fixed price procurement frameworks for the supply of long and medium range battery electric passenger cars and vans to public sector bodies. Full details on how to use the framework as well as pricing and supplier contact details can be found on the www.ogp.gov.ie website.  These Frameworks will greatly assist Government departments and bodies to purchase electric cars and vans.   As battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition to EVs. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.445.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800087#WRJ03400"><p>According to the most recent information from the EPA and SEAI, passenger cars account for approximately half of all land transport emissions in Ireland.  In addition to supporting, where feasible, switching trips to sustainable mobility options, a transition to low and zero emission cars is one of the changes necessary if Ireland is to substantially reduce its transport emissions.</p>  <p>  Government has put in place several key policies and provided generous incentives to encourage the transition from conventional, fossil fuel vehicles towards lower-emitting fuels and technologies including electric vehicles (EVs).  EVs are a prominent mitigation measure in the Climate Action Plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is very challenging but indicative of the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceilings in future years.</p>  <p>The transition of the taxi and hackney fleet (technically called Small Public Service Vehicles - SPSVs) towards zero/low-emission vehicles has an important role to play in effecting a substantial reduction in transport CO2   and of air pollutant emissions, particularly in Irish towns and cities due to the high mileage travelled by these vehicles, the stop/start and idling nature of their work, as well as the predominance of fossil fuels within the sector. Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low/zero emission mobility options. As such, I was delighted to announce the continuation and extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2021. The Scheme which is administered by the NTA provides enhanced supports for eligible taxi and hackney drivers switching to EVs. </p>  <p>  In addition, at Budget time, I announced a 2021 allocation of &euro;15 million which will support up to 750 taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with zero-emission capable electric alternatives. The scrappage scheme is open for taxis and hackneys reaching their maximum permissible age limit in 2020/21. Up to &euro;20,000 is available for eligible drivers switching to a new all-electric vehicle and up to &euro;32,500 for those moving to a wheelchair accessible full electric vehicle.</p>  <p>  As a further measure to support the SPSV sector's transition to low emissions, dedicated charging infrastructure for EV taxis is currently being developed across the country. Last year, my Department funded installation of SPSV-dedicated EV charging infrastructure at Dublin and Cork airports, as well as at Heuston, Kent and Colbert train stations.  My Department will support further installations for SPSV charging at key transport hubs in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600.  </p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks). There are a number of complex planning issues to address to expand the grant in this way and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved.  </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with key stakeholders, including local government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes helping to develop appropriate guidance for local authorities to facilitate the expansion of the national public charging network using the supports available.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government published in June last year, commits to publishing an electric vehicle infrastructure strategy. Once completed, the strategy will provide a key framework for ensuring sufficient infrastructure to keep ahead of demand. I expect the strategy to be completed and published later this year. </p></reply>

These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, with some of these now extended to 30 June 2021. Irish airlines and airports have availed of over &euro;200 million through these supports to date. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. </p>  <p>  As regards supports specifically targeted at the protection of employment, the Employment Wage Subsidy Schemes (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government's response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment amid these very challenging times and has been extended to the end of June 2021. </p>  <p>  In November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically  for Irish aviation in 2021. A part of this package, over &euro;21 million, is being provided to our Regional Airports Programme (RAP). The new RAP, published on 4 February, gives funding certainty to those airports up to 2025. Those airports eligible for RAP support are Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West (Knock). Additionally, &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a &euro;26 million Irish state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. This scheme consists of three measures: a damage compensation measure; an aid measure to support the airport operators up to a maximum of &euro;1.8 million per beneficiary; and an aid measure to support the uncovered fixed costs of these companies. The aid will take the form of direct grants and airports will be invited to apply for funding under this Scheme shortly. </p>  <p>  This scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and to make a recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. It cannot be excluded that further targeted supports may be required later in 2021, particularly in the event that restrictions on travel remain in place throughout the forthcoming summer season. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis. On 5  March, Minister Ryan and Minister Naughton chaired a special meeting of the Steering Committee of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum . A sub-group of the NCADF, specifically tasked with developing an Aviation Restart Plan at the meeting on 5 March, submitted a report dated 14 April with proposals that they believe will best provide for the restart and recovery of the aviation sector in Ireland. My department has written to the NCADF seeking additional information and clarity on the operational readiness of the sector regarding a resumption of international travel, including detail on how passengers will travel through our airports in a safe and COVID-19 compliant manner. I am reviewing this report and its proposals, and will also engage with other ministers and Government as required. </p>  <p>  Under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, an aviation sub-group has also been charged with looking at the needs of the aviation sector in Ireland in the context of the impact of COVID-19. This sub-group, which I chair, is attended by delegations from labour and employer representative bodies. </p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact of the global pandemic on international travel and values the critical role that aviation plays in the Irish economy. It is expected that it may be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel, but we are committed to progressing the work that will allow the sector to quickly rebound when circumstances allow.</p></reply>

Minister of State Naughton and I continue to stress to the airlines that people are given choice and are allowed to defer travel &ndash; because of legitimate reasons &ndash; without being penalised.   </p>  <p>  Ryanair has most recently stated that the expiry dates for vouchers that were issued last year have been extended to enable passengers to make bookings when travel is open again. In this vein, rebooking can also be made with no charge of flight fee for travel before 31 Oct 2021. Vouchers that were offered to customers whose flights were cancelled can be converted to cash at any time or can be redeemed for future bookings.</p>  <p>  Aer Lingus has indicated that under their &ldquo;Book with Confidence&rdquo; policy - covering all flights scheduled to run until the end of 2021 including those who may have already re-booked for a future travel date &ndash; customers are able to change their travel date free of charge, as many times as they wish up to 2 hours before their flight. They also indicate that passengers may swap their booking for a voucher and that their vouchers are valid for 5 years.</p>  <p>  With regard to refunds for cancelled flights, it is understood that the backlogs have been prioritised and that most refunds have now been processed. I would encourage anyone, who having already corresponded with an airline continues to have difficulties securing a refund,  to contact the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which is the statutory body in Ireland with responsibility for enforcing airline refund obligations. </p>  <p>  Further advice on consumer rights, including information on how you might submit a formal complaint to the CAR is available on its dedicated passenger rights website www.flightrights.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.558.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800089#WRL04300"><p>I recognise that COVID-19 has had a profound impact on small businesses across the country with the public transport sector being especially affected as public health restrictions have necessarily discouraged people from travelling generally. Taxi and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) operators, who are particularly dependent on the hospitality and tourism sectors, have faced a particularly pronounced drop in demand for their services. </p>  <p>  It is in recognition of these difficulties that the Government has introduced a wide-ranging programme of supports with broad eligibility criteria for individuals and businesses which have been adversely affected by COVID-19. Many of these supports can be accessed by self-employed taxi drivers including liquidity and investment measures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Enterprise Support Grant and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) from the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  Self-employed recipients of the PUP, which includes many SPSV drivers, can also avail of the Self-Employment Income Scheme which provides for an income disregard for the first &euro;960 earned in a given 8-week period. Individuals exiting the PUP may also avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant, a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 which can be used towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>   I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV towards zero/low-emission vehicles and I have increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme from &euro;1 million in 2020 to &euro;15 million in 2021. Furthermore, in view of the particular challenges faced by operators of older vehicles, I have doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. Additional amounts are available for those switching to vehicles which are both electric and wheelchair accessible.  There has been a strong interest in the revised scheme since its launch in February with over 400 applications received to date. </p>  <p>  In relation to access to bus lanes, the Deputy may wish to be aware that there are no plans to change the present arrangement whereby taxis can access bus lanes during their course of business.</p>  <p>  The Government has not exercised quantitative controls on taxi licences for nearly two decades. The consequences of such quantitative controls in the past were that passengers routinely endured lengthy queues for taxis at ranks. Dublin in particular suffered from a chronic undersupply of taxis. A moratorium on the issuance of licences would not serve the interests of those who use taxis and I do not support it. There are no plans to reintroduce such controls. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe a moratorium would, in any event, address the core concerns of taxi drivers, noting that licence applications are just a fraction of what they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Age limits for taxis and hackneys are a matter for the NTA as statutory regulator. I can confirm, however, that the NTA has extended age limits for taxis twice since the start of the pandemic. Following an initial extension in March 2020, last December, following public consultation, the NTA extended them further to the end of 2021. I trust that the NTA will keep this issue under active review as the pandemic progresses.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, which is established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, enjoys a broad membership with members representing driver interests, dispatch operators, passenger interests, and official stakeholders such as local Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This diversity of representation, combined with members' commitment to having a well-functioning and effective SPSV sector, is a real strength of the Committee. It has been highly effective throughout the pandemic and will remain the central focus of my engagement with the SPSV sector. I will be meeting with the Advisory Committee again this week and I encourage taxi representatives to work constructively through this Committee. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority, as statutory regulator for the sector, will continue to engage with the industry and communicate regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  My Department and the NTA will also continue to engage from time to time with stakeholder groups, including driver representative groups.</p></reply>

The legal basis for these formalities are set out in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement agreed between the EU and the UK in December last year, in the Union Customs Code which governs the customs requirements for trade with non-EU countries and in the Official Controls Regulation in respect of Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) products. </p><p>The requirements for goods being imported from the UK since 01 January 2021, including products of animal origin, germinal products and animal by-products manufactured in the UK, include the following:</p><p>- a safety and security (ENS) declaration</p><p>- an import declaration</p><p>- pre-notification of SPS products</p><p>- a licence for certain goods under prohibitions and restrictions rules</p><p>- payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT) at importation and Excise Duty and Customs Duty as applicable</p><p>- inspection or controls by Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) or the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Agency.</p><p>Where the import involves live animals or products of animal origin, these goods can only be imported via a designated Border Control Post (BCP). These goods must be pre-notified to DAFM and depending on the nature of the goods official controls may also be required at the BCP. There are BCPs at both Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort and at Dublin Airport to facilitate official controls on SPS goods arriving in Ireland from the UK. Once import formalities including SPS controls, payment of duties etc. have been completed the goods are released for free circulation and may leave the port of arrival for onward movement to their destination.</p><p>Under the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU SPS requirements and the Union Customs Code continue to apply to goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain or other third countries. Under these EU rules, SPS checks must always be completed at the first point of entry. In the example provided by the Deputy, SPS controls must be completed at Larne. While the Protocol allows customs formalities to be completed in either Northern Ireland or Ireland, it is easier to also complete customs formalities at the first point of arrival and many businesses will complete both at this point.  </p><p>If a trader does not wish to complete the customs formalities at the first point of entry then, once the SPS controls have been completed, the goods continue under their simplified customs transit procedure to an Office of Destination in Ireland. The customs formalities can then be completed at the Office of Destination which can be either a Customs authorised business premises or a Revenue designated Office of Destination. I am informed by Revenue that the Revenue designated Offices of Destination for goods arriving from the UK, via Northern Ireland, are at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort. Further information on the transit procedure, including information on the authorisation of business premises, can be found on the Revenue website - </p></reply>

There are two reasons for this. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the expenditure estimates in the SPU were compiled on a technical basis with expenditure ceilings assumed to rise by 3.5 per cent annually. There were no further adjustments other than an assumed reduction in Covid expenditure, as well as allowance for additional expenditure associated with the two steams of EU funding &mdash; the Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the Recovery and Resilience Facility. Under these circumstances, including carbon tax revenue increases without the matching hypothecated increase in expenditure would have given an inaccurate presentation of the Exchequer position.</p>  <p>  Relatedly, any long-term forecast for carbon tax revenue would need to consider, inter alia, the shift in demand from behavioural changes related to the tax; new technologies; the global price of crude oil; exchange rates; EU Regulations; and rare earth mineral prices. Given this complexity, officials from my Department, as well as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are engaging on how best to take account of the annual carbon tax increases &mdash;and associated hypothecated expenditure &mdash; in medium to long-term fiscal projections. </p></reply>

While I have regard for the circumstances in question, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on individual cases. Furthermore, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or groups. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that firms will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor cover and what terms to apply. For example, factors may include inter alia the driver&rsquo;s age; relevant driving experience; the age and type of vehicle; how and where the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the storage location. Insurers also price in accordance with their specific claims experience and do not use the same combination of rating factors. In the case of hackney or taxi drivers, I understand that insurers take into account the nature of the business, which involves extensive driving for hire or reward, and that in their view, this has a much higher risk of injury claims from passengers and other road-users as a result.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy may be aware, under the terms of the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA), which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide cover to an individual seeking motor insurance if they have approached at least three insurers and have not been able to obtain cover from them. I would note that the number of taxi and hackney drivers utilising the DCA fell from 375 in 2016 to 205 in 2019, and to just 24 in 2020. While the numbers for 2020 are likely to have decreased in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall downward trend suggests increased stability in the market and greater availability of insurance for drivers.</p>  <p>  Moreover, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government, as reflected in the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. In this regard, work is ongoing to deliver further key reforms over the coming months, which I believe will go some way to improving both the cost and availability of insurance for consumers, businesses and community groups. </p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the individual concerned to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, including motor insurance.

In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities. </p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>The terms of the Scheme set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The HSE and the Revenue Commissioners do not collate data on the nature of the disabilities of successful applicants to the Scheme so are not in a position to provide the breakdown requested by the Deputy.</p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p><p>On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>In order to allow for the PMC assessments and appeals to recommence I brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation which, following the approval of the Finance Act 2020, allowed assessments to recommence. </p><p>Following approval of the Finance Act 2020, a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities and the criteria for qualification for the Scheme, will be conducted this year. On foot of that review new proposals will be brought forward for consideration.</p><p>Further information on supports available to persons with disabilities can be found at </p><p> </p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays &ldquo;qualifying fees&rdquo; for an approved course whether on his or her own behalf or on behalf of another individual. Claimants who pay tuition fees in instalments can claim tax relief either in the tax year when the academic year commenced or the tax year when the instalment is paid.</p><p>&ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &ldquo;student contribution&rdquo;. No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees. A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students. It should be noted that any claim for relief must be submitted within the 4-year time limit which applies to claiming tax reliefs. </p><p>The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course per academic year.  In accordance with the governing legislation, an amount must be disregarded, whether the claim is in respect of one or more students. The disregarded amount per claim is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course(s) and &euro;1,500 for a part time course(s). One disregard amount applies to each claim.</p><p>Full details of the relief, including the conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/education/tuition-fees-paid-for-third-level-education/index.aspx. Revenue advises that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim third level tuition fees and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging on to myAccount on the Revenue website at . </p><p>In terms of the question of retrospective tax relief, it should be noted that section 473A requires that fees are paid as a trigger for the relief and, as is generally the case with tax reliefs, the claimant must have suffered tax in the year of claim in order to avail of the relief.  </p><p>More generally, as the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, changes to measures should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p><p>Finally, I would be reluctant to introduce further complexities to this particular tax support.  However, if the Deputy has further information regarding the particular circumstances of an individual case, Revenue advises me that it will be happy to consider what relief may be due in that particular instance.</p></reply>

This framework, was insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, whilst the management of staff affairs, including staffing levels, is entirely a matter for KBC and Bank of Ireland were they to acquire the business, I would expect both banks to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff.

Separately, the Level 2 Regulatory Technical Standards were approved by Council and published on 22 March 2021. Accordingly, the Regulation will enter into application by 22 March 2022 - a year following the technical standards publication. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Policy Unit within my Department had domestic responsibility for negotiating this file and has engaged with key domestic stakeholders such as the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Authority, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners as part of the negotiation process.</p>  <p>  I am supportive of the PEPP project in principle, recognising the proposal's objective to lay the foundations for a safer, more cost-efficient and transparent market in affordable and voluntary personal pension savings that can be managed on a pan-European scale. It is envisaged that the PEPP framework will constitute a complementary voluntary scheme alongside national regimes.  Work on this transposition is ongoing with a view to completion within the time-frame.</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group, chaired by my Department, published its Report on supplementary pensions in November 2020. As far as is possible, and consistent with the Group's overarching objective of pension rationalisation and simplification the Report proposes to align the PEPP with existing PRSA legislation. </p>  <p>  In an Irish context, PEPP is likely to be of most interest to mobile workers. Apart from portability, a PRSA potentially has more flexible features than a PEPP, means that the PEPP is unlikely to be more attractive to domestic consumers. However, it may introduce greater competition if European providers offer the PEPP to Irish savers. The first PEPP products are expected to come to the market in 2022.</p>  <p>  The PEPP Regulation contains a number of specific elements including requirements for mandatory advice, for providers to account for Environmental, Social, and Governance factors, and has a cost cap in specific circumstances. As the complexity of some pension products requires a high level of intermediation between the consumer and supplementary pension providers, it is expected that information will be easy to read and will allow for comparability between PEPPs by displaying costs and fees in monetary terms. </p></reply>

However, while I understand a  document on charges has been recently reported on, to date such a document has not been submitted to my Department and as such I cannot comment on its content.</p>  <p>  Having said that, as Minister for Finance my role in the pension policy space primarily relates to the provision of tax relief to encourage individuals to save to ensure they will have sufficient income for use in their retirement. However, it is worth noting that the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG), chaired by my Department, published its Report on supplementary pensions in November 2020. This provides a number of recommendations and conclusions to help advance the aim of simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of this aim it seeks to improve regulatory oversight and reduce costs which in turn should lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers. It highlights the complexity of pension products which currently require a high level of intermediation between the consumer and supplementary pension providers, driving up costs for some consumers through payments of fees and commissions for intermediation and advice services.</p>  <p>  The Report states that reducing the number of schemes and rationalising pension products will help diminish such complexity, enhance market competitiveness, drive product efficiencies and in turn should lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers. </p>  <p>  The IDPRTG Report represents a building block for a significant longer term reform in the area of supplementary pensions, which in turn will have wider longer term consumer, economic and fiscal benefits. The Group is actively working on implementing a number of those recommendations with a view to addressing some of those highlighted issues.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct companies as to what terms and conditions apply in relation to cover.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer life insurance and what terms to apply.  These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle.  In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration.  In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule.  In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  While the above applies in general, I am aware of reports that some customers, including those with Type-1 diabetes, have experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining life insurance or mortgage protection cover in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and my officials have raised in meetings with Insurance Ireland, and more recently with the CEOs of the main insurers in the Irish market.  Insurance Ireland stated that while unaware of any cases where life cover has been denied, such policies are assessed on a case-by-case basis and that underlying health conditions, such as Type 1 diabetes, will be taken into account by underwriters, as was the case pre-COVID-19.  It will continue to keep in close contact with its members on this issue, which I welcome.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have consistently and publicly stated that in the context of COVID-19, we expect insurance firms to treat their customers fairly, honestly, and in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  </p>  <p>  Finally, where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .</p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises. </p><p>A person whose business activity consists of the leasing of a business premises would not meet the eligibility criteria for support under the scheme because any profits derived from such a business activity would generally not be regarded as trading profits that are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. </p><p>If, upon a tenant terminating a lease to a business premises, the owner of the business premises began to carry on a trade from the business premises concerned in 2020, the person would be regarded as carrying on a &ldquo;new business&rdquo; for the purposes of the CRSS.A new business is a business that was established between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020 and such a business could qualify for the scheme where it meets the eligibility criteria.  </p><p>In the case of a new business, any potential claim under the CRSS would be based on the average weekly turnover of the business in the period between the date of commencement and 12 October 2020.  Where, however, the business did not operate in 2020, and therefore did not have any turnover between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, the business would not be entitled to any payments under the scheme.  </p><p>Businesses not falling within the scope of the CRSS may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.  Another scheme that a business not eligible for CRSS may qualify for, where certain criteria are met, is the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC). </p></reply>

The Minister of State in my Department, Sean Fleming TD, has credit unions as part of his remit.  </p>  <p>  While recent high profile departures from the banking sector that the Deputy references are disappointing, they do present an opportunity for credit unions to grow. To that end, Minister Fleming met with both the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) in recent months to discuss their respective members' strategies as a result of the changing landscape.</p>  <p>  There are a number of commitments set out in Programme for Government, including a review of the policy framework in which credit unions operate. As part of the review, the Department has held extensive engagement with the credit union representative bodies since September 2020 to seek feedback on their key priorities for the sector. In addition, the Department is taking into account work already completed by the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC). </p>  <p>  It is important to state that credit unions are co-operative financial institutions owned and controlled by their members. Each credit union has a common bond that establishes the basis for membership (e.g. members within a community or a workplace) and credit unions can offer services to members that are within their common bond. </p>  <p>  In terms of the services /products that credit unions can and already do provide, the Deputy may be interested in the following:</p>  <p>  Review of Lending and Investment Regulations</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has in recent years completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks to ensure that credit unions operate under a framework that is both tailored and proportionate, to reflect the unique nature of the sector, and to provide flexibility for credit unions who have ambitions to grow.  </p>  <p>  Following introduction of the new lending regulations on 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion in SME and mortgage loans, with further additional lending capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As at December 2020, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;344 million, an increase of 12% year-on-year.  </p>  <p>  The revised investment regulations took effect on 1 March 2018. Under these regulations, credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including accounts in authorised credit institutions, certain bank and corporate bonds, sovereign bonds and investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to provide social housing.</p>  <p>  SME Lending</p>  <p>  Nineteen credit unions, supported by ILCU, CUDA and Metamo, have been approved by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. With their local knowledge, credit unions are ideally placed to support the recovery and providing loans to local businesses is a key element of the recovery. The further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also have the additional benefit of assisting credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.</p>  <p>  Access to Finance for Retrofit</p>  <p>  The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2021. My officials have been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communication, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.</p>  <p>  Investment in Approved Housing Bodies</p>  <p>  Since 1 May 2018 it has been possible for credit unions to invest in Approved Housing Bodies through a regulated vehicle. I understand that a number projects are being progressed by the sector at present, which may lead to investment in AHBs.</p>  <p>  Current Accounts</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that under the additional services regime set out in the 2016 regulations credit unions can seek approval from the Central Bank to offer additional services such as current accounts and debit cards. 51 credit unions, representing circa 50% of sector assets, currently have approval to provide Member Personal Current Account Service (MPCAS).</p></reply>

Nevertheless, working to protect insurance policyholders during and after the COVID-19 crisis, with particular emphasis on motor insurance rebates, remains a priority issue for Government. As such, this is included within the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming and I have had extensive engagement with motor insurers and other key policy stakeholders throughout the pandemic. We have consistently called on insurers to: treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally, and in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code; emphasised the need for industry to respond to both the Government&rsquo;s ongoing reforms and the pandemic by lowering premiums; continuing to offer forbearance measures; and expanding its risk horizon in the market (such as providing more cover for younger drivers).  </p>  <p>  Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurance firms in the last number of weeks.  He outlined that Government is continuing to implement measures from the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, and that the new Personal Injuries Guidelines were coming into force ahead of schedule, on 24 April. This key development will be of major benefit to insurers as it will help reduce the cost of claims, as well as allow the expansion of their business on the basis of greater confidence around more sustainable and consistent award levels. He also outlined that on renewal Government expects premiums should reduce for all classes of insurance and insurers should consider increasing their risk appetite and proactively identify market opportunities where coverage gaps currently exist.  </p>  <p>  The issue of COVID-19 forbearance measures was on the agenda for these meetings, and I understand that a number of firms indicated that they will also take account of COVID-19 restrictions when setting premiums. It is Minister of State Fleming&rsquo;s intention to meet with the CEOs later in the year to continue to review matters.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I assure the Deputy that both Minister of State Fleming and I are committed to continuing our engagement with insurers and other relevant stakeholders on this important issue. We believe it is important that insurers demonstrate that they are reflecting any savings in a transparent, proactive manner. As such, we will continue to highlight our position on the need to support customers throughout this crisis period.</p></reply>

Revenue uses a broad range of data, intelligence and analytical tools and technologies to identify and quantify risk in order to effectively identify, target and confront cases presenting a risk of non-compliance. </p><p>I am further advised that taxpayer behaviour determines the nature, extent and consequences of Revenue&rsquo;s compliance interventions. Revenue&rsquo;s interventions range from non-audit compliance interventions such as assurance checks, aspect queries and profile interviews to audit or investigations. It undertakes investigations where cases of serious tax and duty evasion and fraud are discovered, seeking to apply the full legal sanctions available that reflect the seriousness of the evasion involved.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that Section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 criminalises tax and duty evasion in general and specifically failures to comply with the provisions of the various Taxes Acts. Any person convicted on indictment of an offence under section 1078 is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970 or, at the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or both. The level of fines and prison terms imposed is a matter for the courts. </p><p>The level of fines provided for on conviction on indictment were last increased from IR&pound;10,000 to IR&pound;100,000 by section 211 of Finance Act 1999 with effect from 25 March 1999. The IR&pound;100,000 fine on conviction on indictment was subsequently converted to its Euro equivalent of &euro;126,970 in 2001. </p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work in investigating cases of serious tax and duty offences with a view to prosecution has achieved a considerable level of success and I am advised by Revenue that the current levels of fines provided for in legislation are sufficient for the purposes of deterring tax evasion. I will, however, consider any future proposals for legislative change that may be brought forward by Revenue in the light of changing behaviour or emerging risks. </p><p>The table below outlines the number of indictable convictions for serious offences under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It also provides a breakdown of the estimated tax loss subject to investigation by Revenue and the number of custodial sentences imposed by the courts. It should be noted that the estimated tax loss is based on estimation of tax loss when Revenue decided to proceed with investigation towards prosecution. In the time available, Revenue was not able to provide the estimated tax loss in all such cases. </p></reply>

Our Fourth Irish Language Scheme 2021-2024 is currently in the final stages of preparation before being confirmed by the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media as per section 14 of the Official Languages Act 2003. My Department is committed to providing quality services to its customers in Irish and/or bilingually including written correspondence, oral announcements/telephone communication with the public, speeches, public meetings, media communications, official invitations, service to Gaeltacht areas and publications.</p>  <p>  My Department has Customer Feedback Forms available to visitors in both Irish and English. These forms are not published online and are not emailed out, however, under the Customer Service charter available on my Department&rsquo;s website, the customer services email address is available so that matters can be raised directly, if required. My Department&rsquo;s Subject Access Request form, which is provided in line with Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is also available in both Irish and English on the website.</p>  <p>  The following is the position for each of the bodies under the aegis of my Department in relation to facilitating persons wishing to engage with their services through the Irish language:</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Language Scheme 2019-2022 is available on its website and is also available on the Bank&rsquo;s Irish website. Under the Language Scheme, the Bank has a number of measures in place to facilitate individuals who wish to engage through Irish, including availability of an Irish speaker to carry out banking transactions at the Bank&rsquo;s Teller Service, a public contacts helpline, consumers being able to exercise any rights under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 through Irish and being able to complete the process to request a credit report, amendment, or explanatory statement and make a notice of suspected impersonation in Irish. All of its forms with a public-facing dimension are available in both Irish and English on the Bank&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has arrangements in place to ensure that its services are provided through Irish when requested and its complaint form is available in both Irish and English. The FSPO also uses a form for the purposes of facilitating Data Access Requests &ndash; this form is in the process of being translated into Irish. </p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) has arrangements in place, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency which provides facilities and ICT support to HBFI, in order to facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish. I am informed that HBFI does not currently have any forms available to the general public in Irish, however, where a member of the public communicates with HBFI in an official language, HBFI will reply in the same language.</p>  <p>  As a small organisation of six staff, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council facilitates persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish on an ad-hoc basis. The Fiscal Council does not have any forms available for public use. </p>  <p>  Any appeal or application addressed to the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal in Irish will be processed, heard and judged in that language at an Applicant&rsquo;s request. Given the complex and technical nature of the subject matter of the disputes heard by the Tribunal, where necessary, they will engage the services of suitably qualified translators/interpreters for the translation of any technical documentation. Its forms are available in both English and Irish, and the Irish language forms will be supplied to any Applicant on request.</p>  <p>  While the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) does not provide services directly to the public, there are three functions it performs in which the public may have an interest; Dormant Accounts, Eligible Liabilities Guarantee Scheme and State Savings. There are employees available to communicate with callers through Irish if required. An email address is in place to facilitate the submission of queries from the general public in Irish. State Savings are the Government savings products the NTMA offers through An Post and the Prize Bond Company to personal savers. Documentation relating to the products are available in Irish via the State Savings website. With regard to forms available to the public, An Post (acting as an agent for the NTMA in respect of State Savings) has committed to making all standard forms available in digital form on the Internet in Irish. Acting as the State Claims Agency, the NTMA also manages personal injury, property damage and clinical negligence claims brought against certain State authorities. The NTMA can provide any forms requested by any of its Delegated State Authorities in either of the Official Languages.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has little direct contact with the general public. The Office publishes a number of documents on its website bilingually in line with its Irish Language Scheme. Its website is available bilingually, with a navigational link from each page on the English version to the relevant page in the Irish version. Phone calls are answered bilingually, in Irish first. The choice of language of the customer is established and they are directed to the appropriate official. The Office provides a dedicated e-mail address to facilitate those who wish to communicate with the Office in Irish. The Office does not have any forms available to the public.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners offers a comprehensive range of services to individuals and businesses that wish to conduct their affairs in Irish. The onus is on the individuals and businesses concerned to advise Revenue that they wish to communicate through Irish. Information regarding Revenue&rsquo;s Irish Language Scheme can be found on its website. All Revenue publications, forms and leaflets are available in Irish on its website. </p>  <p>  While the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has limited services delivered to the public, they have arrangements in place, in conjunction with the NTMA which provides its facilities and ICT support, in order to facilitate persons wishing to engage with their services through Irish. The SBCI does not have any forms available in Irish to the general public.</p>  <p>  Any correspondence received by the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) in Irish is responded to in Irish. All publications are published simultaneously in Irish and English on its website which is currently being developed to provide Irish translations of each area. The Commission also has two staff members capable of providing services in Irish. It has three standard forms which are currently being translated into Irish. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Advisory Committee is not a State agency, rather it is a committee set up to advise the Minister for Finance on credit union issues. </p>  <p>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board concluded its restructuring work and was operationally wound down in 2017; it is currently awaiting formal dissolution. </p>  <p>  The Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal does not have obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003. It operates through The National Rehabilitation Hospital which provides clinical facilities and staffing. </p>  <p>  The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation is in liquidation and does not provide services to the public. </p>  <p>  The Investor Compensation Company DAC does not provide services to the public generally and is not subject to the Official Languages Act, 2003. </p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency does not provide services to the general public.</p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is not a public body, and as such does not have obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.

This is particularly important as we steer our way out of the pandemic, rebuild our economy, and support communities that have been severely impacted by Covid-19. The Department of the Taoiseach has led in this regard, taking a number of steps with a view to supporting and enhancing engagement with social partners.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy identifies, one of my Department&rsquo;s primary mechanisms in this area is the National Economic Dialogue. Planning is currently underway within the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to progress the arrangements for this year&rsquo;s deliberative event in a virtual format in late June. The Dialogue provides a forum for stakeholders to participate in an open, inclusive and robust exchange on the challenges facing the economy and the options for the allocation of public resources. It is an important annual part of the budgetary process. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Dialogue is to ensure an appropriate balance between the relevant stakeholders to facilitate discussion of budgetary issues affecting a broad social spectrum. To this end, representatives of community, voluntary and environmental groups as well as business, unions, research institutes, the media, the diaspora and members of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight participate in the discussions. </p>  <p>  I believe the National Economic Dialogue is a very constructive exercise. Decisions that have been made on the content of past budgets have been influenced by previous Dialogues and I intend to draw upon this year&rsquo;s discussion when formulating Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The DCA is operated independently by Insurance Ireland.</p><p>However, my Department does attend the Declined Cases Committee Annual General Meeting (AGM) as an observer. This arose primarily as a result of recommendation 7 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, which recommended that the DCA be subject to ongoing review to help ensure transparency. </p><p>Insurance Ireland has provided the data below to my Department in relation to those applying to the DCA for cover: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>1,423 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>1,147 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1,066 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>523 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In relation to these figures, it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding from information provided by Insurance Ireland that quotations were secured for all applicants through the Agreement framework and that it therefore considers all to have been successful. </p><p>I would note that the numbers applying to the DCA have been reducing in recent years, having peaked previously at 1,941 in 2016.  While the numbers for 2020 are likely to have eased in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I believe that the decreases over the last number of years demonstrate that reforms, by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, and more recently by the Cabinet Committee Sub-group on insurance reform, are having a positive impact on motor insurance.</p></reply>

The scheme applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, self-assessed income tax amounts (balance of 2019 income tax liability and 2020 preliminary tax) and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) overpayments. Approximately 85,000 businesses are currently availing of the scheme covering &euro;2.3 billion in tax debt.</p>  <p>  The scheme allows businesses to &lsquo;park&rsquo; these debts on an interest free basis for 12 months following the resumption of trading.  At the end of the 12-month interest free period, the warehoused debt may be paid in full without incurring an interest charge or paid through a tailored phased payment arrangement at a significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum. This compares to the standard rate of 8% or 10% per annum that would otherwise apply to such debts.</p>  <p>  Businesses that availed of the Debt Warehousing Scheme at the start of the pandemic and subsequently resumed trading for a period during 2020 before being further restricted can recommence availing of the support. As such, they can warehouse relevant tax debts from the beginning of the initial lockdown, including in respect of the period/s during which they were trading between lockdowns. Revenue has communicated directly with those who previously availed of the scheme to inform them of its continued availability. </p>  <p>  Access to the scheme is automatic for SMEs and by agreement with larger businesses that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. A key requirement of the scheme is that businesses continue to file all relevant tax returns for the restricted trading period(s), so that the tax debt can be quantified and warehoused. </p></reply>

Regarding the remaining 267 vehicles, based on the unit cost of electric vehicles in the current Office of Government Procurement (OGP) framework, the direct cost of replacing them would be between &euro;10.63m and &euro;11.87m inclusive of VAT, depending on the mix of vehicles required.

Ireland is one of just 10 EU Member States to already have comprehensive whistleblowing laws in place, in the form of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, and is considered a leading country in this field - most recently, the International Bar Association rated Ireland joint second in the world for the protections it provides to whistleblowers in a report published in March of this year.</p>  <p>  Work on an initial draft of the transposing legislation is at an advanced stage and will be published later in the year.

This study examined a range of transport and mobility options for the park with an emerging preferred option being identified which seeks to reposition the Phoenix Park as an important natural resource for the citizens of Dublin and further afield, while seeking to reduce through traffic over the medium to long term. </p>  <p>  This preferred option will significantly improve pedestrian and cycling safety while also providing more sustainable transport options for those working in the park and accessing its visitor attractions and amenities.  It recommends the upgrade of over 7 km of footpaths along with strategic pedestrian crossing points on Chesterfield Avenue and other key locations throughout the Park, including the Gate entrances.  Further expansion and upgrade of the cycle network within the Park and linkages to the external networks is recommended.  This will involve the creation of 14 km of new cycle lanes and the upgrade of over 17 kms of existing cycle lanes within the Park and at Park entrances.  A reduction in the speed limit is also recommended.</p>  <p>  The  Phoenix Park Transport and Mobility Study public consultation commenced in late January and concluded in mid March with over 2,200 submissions being received.  An analysis of all the submissions received is currently being undertaken and, subject to approval of the final recommendations, OPW will seek to implement these recommendations in the report within the published timelines contained in the final report. </p>  <p>  Another key recommendation in the report is that OPW would review the existing bye-laws pertaining to the Phoenix Park.  The OPW review will include consideration of new provisions relating to electric scooters, and this work will be informed by Government Policy from the Department of Transport.  The Department has proposed the drafting of legislation which will allow for the regulation of e-scooters and e-bikes in the forthcoming Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. </p></reply>

Mentoring is something that the National Disability Authority's own dedicated experts might be asked to coordinate with the Office of Public Works staff on this as a future action. The current position is as follows: </p>  <p>  Training in accessibility for current and planned State occupied building stock has been undertaken under the universal access programme since 2010. More recently and predominantly since 2017 a cohort of in house architectural staff have been trained in accessibility auditing. This was done in a series of tranches of 4 or 5 architects and technicians at a time. It takes three full days immersive training with an industry expert, whose company has sufficient expertise and capacity to provide this (on top of having a related baseline of training as an architect, technician or engineer).</p>  <p>  Funding would be required for a more comprehensive training programme in the context of a mentoring regime. This would require a co-ordinated approach which  might then need specific priority for remedial works to be proposed, planned and procured. A</p>  <p>  mentoring regime is a complex proposition which would require careful</p>  <p>  consideration and planning.</p>  <p>  This is not without challenges, as our programmes of work are diverse and complex. Resourcing it would have to be focused and rigorous with a specific workshop facilitated initially, and a subsequent network set up, governed and managed under a dedicated OPW expert steering committee.</p></reply>

A number of strategic properties or sites are retained in anticipation of potential State use/development in line with service demands arising from Government policy changes to public service provision. </p><p>Secondly, if no State use is identified, the OPW considers if open market disposal is an option, depending on prevailing market conditions. </p><p>Thirdly, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer. </p><p>Before the former Garda station properties are placed on the market, the services of an auctioneer are procured to manage the marketing strategy and public auction.  All legal aspects of the transactions are managed by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.</p><p>O&rsquo;Donnellan Joyce Auctioneers, following a procurement process, have been appointed to manage the next two auctions of properties in the counties of Galway/Mayo and Donegal.</p><p>The procurement of auctioneers for later auctions will take place when there is greater certainty of the timing for these auctions following the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions.</p></reply>

As part of this suite, an allocation of &euro;25 million is being made available under the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021.  This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians and the valuable insights gained. This new scheme is aimed at commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector and will support employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and continued high quality artistic output for the general public. Over 400 applications have been received seeking grants of &euro;80m. Assessment of applications to the scheme are currently underway. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will also be made available to local authorities for outdoor live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances and seek to engage as diverse a range of performers as possible. The administrative arrangements and requirements for this scheme are being finalised and further details will be announced in due course.</p>  <p>  As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers - whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities - operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector will be eligible to apply. This scheme has been developed following wide consultation with the sector. Administrative arrangements for this scheme are being finalised and it is hoped that it will open for applications in the coming weeks when the necessary IT systems are in place.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, &euro;5 million is being made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. </p></reply>

Use antigen alongside testing regimes already in place to verify their usefulness, move antigen testing into new areas and lastly to consider use of antigen tests to assist with the return of spectators to events. For example recommendation B1.9e reiterates the premise that rapid testing trials should begin with participants of sports and only later be used for spectators.  The report will be among the materials that will help inform the eventual return of spectators to sports grounds when it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department will monitor closely how our health authorities are progressing with early trials of rapid testing for Covid-19 at scale. In the meantime, we will continue to be guided by Health officials on how best to allow for safe attendance at sporting and cultural events. We are cautiously optimistic that test events can be undertaken over the course of the summer but that will depend of course on the evolution of the epidemiological situation.</p></reply>

Additionally, Government is providing a range of enterprise supports such as the CRSS (COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme), the CBAS (COVID-19 Business Aid Scheme), commercial rates waivers etc., which many businesses in the sectors my Department supports can avail of.</p>  <p>  In parallel with these developments, key commitments in the Programme for Government were advanced, including the establishment of the Night-time Economy Taskforce and the Future of Media Commission, both of which are looking at longer term polices in respect of night time culture and media respectively.  </p>  <p>  There has already been some key changes for the sports and tourism sectors in April.  These include the reopening of outdoor visitor attractions, outdoor sports facilities and the return of underage non-contact outdoor training in pods of 15.</p>  <p>  As we come into the summer months more activity can take place outside. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme, which is being delivered in partnership with the local authorities, aims to develop outdoor dining capacity nationwide with a budget of &euro;17million.  &euro;5m will also be allocated by my Department to local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances in summer 2021 animating town centres for local communities, should public health considerations permit.  It will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. </p>  <p>  Minister Chambers is engaging with the National Governing Bodies both bilaterally and through the COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group with regard to the supports required in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Government's - The Path Ahead - plan particularly recognises the need for bespoke sectoral supports to address the worst impacted sectors like Tourism and Culture in the forthcoming National Economic Recovery Plan. </p>  <p>  I am resolved to continue to work with stakeholders across my sectors to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors not just during this pandemic, but into the all-important recovery phase which will follow it.</p>  <p>  Over the coming months, as the restrictions ease and the vaccine programme is rolled-out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society, and with it our Tourism sector, our Arts and Culture venues and events, and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds.</p></reply>

As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. The defined categories of harmful online content include criminal material, serious cyberbullying material and material promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders. </p>  <p>  Broadly speaking, the terms referenced in relation to online content: malicious, harassing and abusive, are covered under the OSMR Bill, both in terms of the category of harmful online content concerning criminal material and the category concerning serious cyberbullying material. </p>  <p>  For example, harassment is specifically covered under the category of harmful online content involving criminal material as it is a criminal offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, as amended by the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, 2020 or Coco&rsquo;s Law. </p>  <p>  In the event of continued failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, the Media Commission will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20m or 10% of turnover.</p>  <p>  The finalisation of the General Scheme of the OSMR Bill was approved on 8 December 2020.

This represents progress but the importance of the ongoing roll-out of improved connectivity across all Gaeltacht regions cannot be understated. </p>  <p>  In relation to An Seanphobal and An Rinn in the Waterford Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta supported client-companies in their endeavours to have fibre broadband brought to the areas. To that end, client companies in both An Rinn and An Seanphobal have been able to avail of fibre for the last three years - resulting in a significantly improved service.  </p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has pioneered the concept of remote working in rural Gaeltacht areas and its gteic Digital Network of 30 innovation &amp;amp; digital hubs to be developed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in locations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s Gaeltacht regions.</p>  <p>  There are up to 16 hubs in operation with additional hubs coming on line as the lockdown restrictions are eased. These hubs include hot desk and shared space facilities for remote workers, entrepreneurs, concept developers and eworkers in addition to fully equipped office spaces and incubation units with high speed internet access to facilitate innovation and concept development in Ireland's Gaeltacht areas. The gteic network will be central to providing opportunities for remote working, especially for the Gaeltacht Diaspora looking to return home after the pandemic, with up to 700 desk spaces available when further hubs open and social distancing restrictions are eased. </p>  <p>  This initiative not only aligns with key objectives of supporting enterprise development and innovation in remote areas but also continues to exploit the emerging opportunities in these regions on foot of the ongoing roll-out  of the Government's National Broadband Plan. </p></reply>

To date 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme. A table showing the 52 completed pools and the date of opening is attached.</p><p>In relation to the three remaining pools, work on the Lucan project has commenced. Both Buncrana and Edenderry are at Contract Documents stage. There are no outstanding applications under the LASPP.</p><p>Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now being provided under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF).  The LSSIF was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects including swimming pools with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027. Provisional grants to 8 swimming pool projects under the LSSIF were awarded in January 2020. Those projects are now at various stages of a due diligence process. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF Programme which is expected to be complete in the coming months. This review will consider, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded. The timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan.</p><p>My Department does not have the requested information in relation to public swimming pools which are closed for reasons unrelated to the current Covid-19 restrictions and the rationale for these closures. The Department's direct role is to provide capital support for the construction of some of these pools and the Department has no role in the day-to-day running of these facilities. .</p><p>In relation to future needs, the National Sports Policy 2018 -2027 (NSP), launched on 25 July 2018, commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. This will involve close collaboration with relevant Government Departments, Local Authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sport Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 is nearing completion and will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in the early stages of that Action Plan.</p></reply>

The organisation has confirmed to Sport Ireland that there have been no compulsory redundancies as part of its restructuring process.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the MOU, the board of the organisation has established an Executive Performance and Remuneration Committee to support it in its responsibilities for, inter alia, determining executive remuneration policy and the pay and benefits policy for staff.  As agreed in the MOU, two of the members of the committee are independent directors, one of whom is chair of the committee.</p>  <p>  The organisation has confirmed to Sport Ireland that the Executive Performance and Remuneration Committee conducted a thorough review of executive remuneration in 2020.</p></reply>

The Government has stated that there will be no cliff-edge ending to these supports.</p>  <p>  Specific support for such businesses in question is a matter for my colleagues the Minister for Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage Darragh O'Brien TD, and Minister of State for Heritage &amp;amp; Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan TD.   I understand from them that the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has been involved in discussions with the zoo sector throughout the period of the pandemic in connection with difficulties faced by the sector as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions and to consider how that Department might be of assistance.  </p>  <p>  In November 2020, Minister Noonan announced funding of &euro;1.6 million for the zoo sector, to encompass all licensed zoos including aquaria.  The funding was allocated in the form of a grant scheme, open to the 69 licensed establishments in Ireland.  This was aimed primarily at preventing an animal welfare crisis as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.  Of the total amount of &euro;1.6 million, a fund of &euro;500,000 was available to assist small and medium sized zoos and aquaria.  This financial support from my colleagues recognised the vital role played by our zoos and aquaria as networks for global conservation of biodiversity, as centres of learning and places where lifelong memories of families and children are made.  This emergency funding will also safeguard employment and stimulate local economies in recovering by ensuring the continued operation of viable zoo establishments throughout the country.</p>  <p>  As Minister with responsibility for Tourism, I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery and I continue to engage with bodies representing the visitor attractions sector.  As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will be outlining how it will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. </p></reply>

Against this backdrop  the &lsquo;Gaeltacht na h&Eacute;ireann&rsquo; brand will continue to be deployed in support of the organisation's key objectives.</p><p>Work will also continue, in partnership with other key stakeholders including my Department, in further developing the Gaeltacht&rsquo;s unique potential in the realm of cultural tourism. In that regard, a range of  flagship tourism projects, marketing initiatives and capacity-building programmes, already in train, will be further advanced in a way that aligns with relevant Government policies and programmes including the National Development Plan and Our Rural Future. In that overall setting,  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to work in partnership with my Department, F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and other key stakeholders. </p><p>Usage of &ldquo;Gaeltacht na h&Eacute;ireann&rdquo; branding continues to grow since its initial launch and is now in use by over 500 businesses, organisations, language planning groups and Gaeltacht organisations in a range of different contexts.</p><p>Top-class Gaeltacht products and companies were introduced to the world online as part of the 40th anniversary of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2020. The Gaeltacht Craft EXPO and Gaeltacht Food &amp;amp; Drink Expo 2020 were held to celebrate Craft, Food and Drink products and companies. Both Expos were run under the auspices of the &lsquo;Gaeltacht na h&Eacute;ireann&rsquo; brand, linking the brand to the best of Gaeltacht products. </p><p>Furthermore, a Gaeltacht Directory has been developed on the organisation&rsquo;s website providing online access to  Gaeltacht companies and enabling product purchase under the overall branding initiative. A comprehensive digital campaign &lsquo;From the Gaeltacht with Love&rsquo; was completed just before Christmas 2020, encouraging customers to support Gaeltacht companies and to purchase from them online.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has placed significant pressure on the tourism sector. It is, therefore, now more important than ever that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to support the development of strategic Gaeltacht tourism facilities, including</p><p>- Fanad Lighthouse,</p><p>- Togra na hEaragaile,</p><p>- The Croithl&iacute; Distillery,</p><p>- Carna Emigrant Centre,</p><p>- Seanospid&eacute;al an Daingin,</p><p>- Leitir Meall&aacute;in Seaweed &amp;amp; Heritage Centre; and,</p><p>- Ionad &Aacute;rann.</p><p>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, through online workshops and seminars, is also working with existing and potential tourism businesses to develop tourism product that will provide unique Gaeltacht experience. Enabling the digitisation of tourism business through marketing and delivery of tourism services will be a key focus for the coming 2 &ndash; 3 years.In light of the challenges of COVID-19, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is also working with community groups and employment schemes to upgrade and expand walking trails on Bealach na Gaeltachta.  </p><p>A one year extension, to the value of &euro;450,000, has been approved for 15 Gaeltacht tourism development officers under the tourism development scheme. These officers are working to develop visitor centres and marketing networks as well as specific recovery plans. &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta organised online workshops during the summer of 2020 to enable businesses to take advantage of the domestic market and to develop and sell tourism experiences, products and services online. </p><p>The projects involved in the Gaeltacht Tourism Development Scheme are</p><p>- Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair</p><p>- Sl&iacute; Chorca Dhuibhne</p><p>- Comhchoiste Ghaeltachta&iacute; Chiarra&iacute; Theas</p><p>- Ionad Deirbhile, An Eachl&eacute;im</p><p>- Turas&oacute;ireacht Chontae Dh&uacute;n na nGall</p><p>- Carna Emigrant Centre, Carna</p><p>- Ionad Cois Locha Teo, D&uacute;n L&uacute;iche</p><p>- C&oacute;sta Gaelach Chonamara &amp;amp; &Aacute;rann</p><p>- Comhaontas Turas&oacute;ireachta Chorca Dhuibhne</p><p>- Fanad Lighthouse</p><p>- Leitir Meall&aacute;in Seaweed &amp;amp; Heritage Centre</p><p>- Ionad &Aacute;rann, Inis M&oacute;r</p><p>- Joyce Country Geopark</p><p>- Sliabh Liag, Co.

In each of the 31 local authorities, the Creative Ireland Programme has established a Culture and Creativity Team which brings together local expertise in culture, arts, Irish language, heritage, libraries, enterprise and community engagement, to foster collaboration and spark new initiatives. A local Creative Ireland Coordinator has also been appointed for each local authority.  With the help of creative, cultural and heritage organisations (including Irish language organisations), and community groups across the country, each local authority created a five-year Culture and Creativity Strategy 2018 &ndash; 2022, that has been published in English and Irish. These are locally-led and designed to enable people to work together to transform their communities, their lives and their environment through creativity.  The corresponding projects which are programmed by the local authorities as part of the Creative Communities initiative encompass Irish language events.</p>  <p>  In addition, and in close collaboration with the Gaeltacht Division of this department, the Creative Ireland Programme (through its Creative Youth Plan) supports Fighting Words to run creative writing workshops in Irish, when requested, throughout Ireland.  An Irish language coordinator based in Conamara supports all such workshops in the Conamara Gaeltacht.  The Creative Ireland Coordinators in local authorities have provided support to Fighting Words, when requested, to facilitate these workshops. </p>  <p>  Also as part of the Creative Youth Plan, it is worth noting that the Creative Schools Programme and the Creative Clusters Programme are offered in the primary language of the schools involved, and the Creative Ireland Coordinators in relevant local authorities remain available to support identifying artists and creatives to work with the schools involved.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that local media plays in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news. </p>  <p>  In relation to the supports available for the commercial and independent radio sector, the BAI waived the Broadcasting Levy in the first half of 2020 and requested the BAI to launch a COVID-19 funding round which provided &euro;2.5m for commercial radio stations.  The BAI also ran a Community Radio Fund which delivered an additional &euro;750k to the sector to help cover the cost of running stations, training, mentoring and the development of programming. A further &euro;2.5m special funding round for the commercial radio sector will be announced shortly by the BAI. </p>  <p>  In terms of specific supports for the local newspaper sector, the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are also available to the broadcasting, print and online sectors. The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. Moreover, significant levels of government advertising have been directed towards the local print sector during the COVID-19 crisis to raise awareness and to help explain government policy and health guidelines, an amount estimated to be &euro;4.4m between March 2020 to date.  </p>  <p>  The print sector has been undergoing fundamental changes in recent years due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising. In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion. The Commission have undertaken an extensive public consultation and received over 800 written submissions and conducted six online Thematic Dialogues between January 28th and April 15th.  These are available to view on the Commission&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The print sector have participated in the Commission&rsquo;s consultations and will be part of their recommendations. The Commission is expected to report to An Taoiseach and myself at the end of July and I look forward to reviewing their recommendations with a view to supporting the sustainability of the sector in the longer term. </p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have also engaged in meetings with key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders and work is continuing to ensure  that the sector receives an appropriate level of Government advertising, along with leveraging existing supports in terms of training and skills development.</p></reply>

In light of Brexit, coupled with the economic impact of the pandemic, client companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to need support which is being provided on an ongoing basis by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to work in conjunction with my Department and other state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland to ensure that Gaeltacht enterprises also have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectoral measures in place since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, senior officials from my Department have been in regular contact over the past year with their counterparts in both the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the additional financial requirements of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  This has resulted in an additional &euro;8m being allocated to the organisation under the 2020 July Stimulus package and access for the organisation to up to &euro;5m from the Sustaining Enterprise Fund administered by Enterprise Ireland.  An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s was also provided with additional funding during the course of last year to allow the organisation expand the reach of its Trading Online Voucher Scheme in Gaeltacht areas.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has approved over &euro;7.4m of COVID-19 supports to date for over 435 Gaeltacht companies to address financial and supply difficulties, ensure cash-flow and enhance their ability to access global online sales markets. In addition, many Gaeltacht companies operating in the tourism and hospitality sectors will have accessed the broad range of supports being provided on an ongoing basis for these sectors and for businesses in general which have been introduced by Government since the onset of the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to a spending review and assessment of the impact of Brexit and COVID-19 on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its client companies, which my Department recently completed.  The work was carried out by the Evaluation Unit of my Department, which is a stand-alone unit working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES).   </p>  <p>  My Department engaged with both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a selection of its client companies in order to complete the assessment. The findings and recommendations were considered as part of the 2021 Estimates process and resulted in significant additional exchequer funding of &euro;8.1m being provided to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Budget 2021 -  bringing its total allocation to &euro;31.8m for the current year.  </p>  <p>  As I already alluded to,  it is important to reiterate that Gaeltacht enterprises continue to have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectoral measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for Brexit. Furthermore, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta also has access to the schemes and funds administered by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices to ensure delivery within the Gaeltacht areas.   </p>  <p>  Looking to the future, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is currently finalising a new Strategic Plan for the period 2021&ndash;2025. The Strategy will set out the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta vision for advancing the sustainability of Gaeltacht communities, via a vibrant enterprise base.  </p>  <p>  The organisation has confirmed that it will continue to ensure that effective and practical supports are available to businesses to mitigate insofar as possible the impacts of COVID-19 and Brexit  and will continue to work closely with my Department and other Government agencies to ensure that Gaeltacht businesses and communities are appropriately assisted through the current challenges.   </p></reply>

A practical outworking of this additional support was the recent announcement by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta regarding the forthcoming appointment of an additional number of staff in key administrative roles. </p>  <p>  An additional  &euro;700,000 was also provided under Budget 2021 for Gaeltacht community development  which  equates to an overall allocation of &euro;4.75m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has pioneered the concept of remote working in rural Gaeltacht areas and its gteic Digital Network consists of 20 Digital hubs with 10 more in development. It is also progressing a range of strategic capital projects across the Gaeltacht. These include Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Baile Bhuirne, Sean Ospid&eacute;al an Daingin, &Aacute;ras Sc&eacute;alta an Atlantaigh in Eachl&eacute;im, Teach Solais Cheann Fh&aacute;nada, Drioglann Chroithl&iacute;, and P&aacute;irc na Mara in Cill Ciar&aacute;in as well as a range of strategic projects based on the green economy and renewable energy sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the impact of COVID-19 on our society and economy over the past 12 months. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, 427 new jobs were created in Gaeltacht companies during 2020. There were 7,363 full-time and 437 part-time jobs in companies supported by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at the end of 2020. Employment remained stable in 68% of client companies while the medical device sector saw a 4% increase in employment during 2020, with over 700 people now employed in the sector in the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to work in conjunction with my Department and other state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland to ensure that Gaeltacht enterprises also have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectoral measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In this context, the Board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has approved over &euro;7.4m of COVID-19 supports to date for over 435 Gaeltacht companies to address financial and supply difficulties, ensure cash flow and enhance their ability to access global online sales markets. In addition, many Gaeltacht companies operating in the tourism and hospitality sectors will have accessed the range of supports for those sectors and for businesses in general which have been introduced by Government since the onset of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  A number of online events were held during 2020 to mark 40 years since the establishment of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. A commemorative booklet has been published online at www.udaras.ie where you will also find further information on the activities of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and copies of year-end statements and annual reports.</p></reply>

Any easing of measures should be slow and gradual with sufficient time between phases to assess impact and to respond if the epidemiological situation was to deteriorate. It will take account of emerging international and national evidence and experience and with a specific focus on supporting mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  As part of that gradual easing of measures, training for National Governing Body sanctioned and organised adult inter-county National Gaelic Games Leagues (not including under 20 or minor competitions) has resumed with effect from Monday, the 19th of April. No decision has yet been made by Government on when competitive play may resume for the Gaelic Games. </p>  <p>  The distinction drawn between elite and non-elite sports and athletes is to be understood in the specific context of the requirement to devise a gradual return to sport in a measured way that involves a limited numbers of participants, locations and travel movements, combined with a capacity and capability to oversee the effective implementation of safety protocols. In contrast, club-level, non-elite activity cannot realistically be expected to be in a position to replicate the same demanding operational environment. </p>  <p>  As we move into the Summer it is my expectation that we will continue to see a gradual easing of the measures applying to sport, including the return of organised adult training and competition, when the public health situation allows.</p></reply>

Working collaboratively, the Creative Ireland Programme has focused on supporting both direct engagement with creativity (e.g., in education, institutions, industry, and communities) as well as creativity as a way of engaging with broader societal issues (e.g., mental health, social marginalisation, rural isolation, poverty, isolation of the aged, individuals with disabilities or special needs, migrant integration, intercultural dialogue, climate action, biodiversity loss).</p><p>The evidence that climate change and the interrelated challenge of biodiversity loss are happening now is compelling. The urgent need for climate action must be addressed both individually and collectively. The Programme for Government commits to an ambitious reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The increased scale and depth of this ambition cannot be addressed through policy and technology alone. A concerted mobilisation of every element of Irish society through sustained engagement is required. To that end, the Programme for Government recognises the need to work in partnership with communities and to further develop the role and deploy the experience of the cultural and creative sectors with a commitment to &ldquo;Support Creative Ireland in engaging the public on climate change through the creative and cultural sectors initiative.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2019, the Creative Ireland Programme in partnership with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment commissioned a report Engaging the Public on Climate Change through the Cultural and Creative Sectors. This report observed that few sectors are better placed than the culture and creative sectors to bridge the gaps between what we know and feel about climate change, and to critically examine and provoke a shift in cultural values and norms.</p><p>In November 2020, I hosted a workshop Creating Deeper Engagement on Climate Change in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications with participation from Minister Ryan as well as policy makers, academics and representatives across the climate change and creative and cultural sectors.  </p><p>To address the Programme for Government&rsquo;s commitment, my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications have provided funding for the Creative Ireland Programme to create partnerships that connect the public sector and the creative sector in order to enhance public engagement with climate change. On the 29<sup>th</sup>March, I launched the Creative Climate Action Fund in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the first fund of its kind in Ireland.  This is a fund of up to &euro;2 million and, depending on the number and scale of the applications received, may fund between 10 &ndash; 20 projects until the end of 2022 with budgets of between &euro;30,000 &mdash; &euro;200,000. There are two strands of funding available for prospective applicants:</p><p>1. An open call &ndash; to organisations, NGOs, charities, enterprises, institutions and collectives/networks working with creative and cultural practitioners;</p><p>2. A closed call &ndash; to local authorities, either individually, with other local authorities or external partners</p><p>The closing date for applications is Friday 21st of May. Applications can be submitted at  which also hosts a detailed briefing note, FAQ&rsquo;s and additional resources. Across both strands, the Creative Climate Action Fund is seeking:</p><p>- Responses of creative or interpretive expression (whether traditional or contemporary) from across the arts, cultural and creative sectors.</p><p>- Projects that can meaningfully connect people and communities with the profound changes that are happening as a result of climate change, and can transform that connection into climate action and behaviour change.</p><p>- Interdisciplinary and collaborative ways of working which bring together creative practitioners with different disciplines, e.g., science, urban planning, engineering, and technology with thought-leaders, activists, academics and others.</p><p>- Initiatives that demonstrate impact and have considered evaluation in order to move beyond raising awareness of climate change, and discuss, encourage, and facilitate system, lifestyle and behaviour changes.</p><p>- Innovative delivery using artistic and creative ways to encourage ideas that are transformative, moving, challenging and thought provoking and promote alternative ways of thinking and acting.</p><p>- Not only deepened participation, but a widening reach to connect with diverse audiences and communities spanning urban and rural, ages and cultures reflecting a scheme that is inclusive, ensuring nobody is left behind as a result of climate action. </p><p>- Initiatives that have the potential for scale and aim for longevity, making the best use of platforms and  focusing on wider participation and engagement, longer term movements and campaigns.</p><p>Sustained climate action requires a combined commitment and cooperation across society, in recognition that the causes, and impacts of climate change are experienced on both a global scale and an individual scale. </p></reply>

Established by my colleague Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, this scheme was launched as an innovative approach to incentivise spending. However, public health conditions beyond our control have clearly prevented that. The stop and start nature of the pandemic and the unpredictable consequences of it have resulted in the scheme being  underutilised and it is now scheduled to expire at the end of April.</p>  <p>  There have been other very effective supports in place, including CRSS and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme for strategic tourism businesses and Government has confirmed there will be no cliff edge in supports.  I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery.  As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will be outlining how it will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. </p>  <p>  A review of the Stay and Spend scheme was one of the recent recommendations of the Tourism Recovery Oversight Group and I have urged cabinet colleagues to give serious consideration to this and other recommendations of that report to facilitate the reopening of the sector. Once the scheme ends it is anticipated that the Minster for Finance will take stock and look to what additional measures might be appropriate to put in place towards the end of the year.  In this regard, while I am hopeful that the summer season will be buoyed by strong numbers in domestic tourism providing much needed business activity within the sector, I am cognisant of the seasonal nature of the industry and financial challenges the leaner shoulder and off season months could bring.  </p>  <p>  In regard to engagement with sectoral bodies, I, my officials and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have regular interactions with industry groups.  In particular, the T&aacute;naiste and I chair the Hospitality and Tourism Forum which has met three times to date and is due to meet again in May.</p></reply>

The NCIs encompass our most iconic cultural venues including the National Gallery, the Irish Museum of Modern Art at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, the National Library, the National Museum (which includes the Museum of Country Life in Turlough Park in Castlebar Co Mayo), the Chester Beatty Library, the Crawford Art Gallery, the National Archives and the National Concert Hall.  The following table shows additional funding given to the institutions in 2020.  The funding for the National Museum of Ireland (NMI) incorporates additional funding for Turlough House in County Mayo which is an integral part of the NMI. <table>    <tr>       <th>Institution</th>       <th>Amount &euro;000s</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Gallery of Ireland</td>       <td>800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Museum of Ireland</td>       <td>867.9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chester Beatty Library</td>       <td>213</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Concert Hall</td>       <td>525.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Museum of Modern Art</td>       <td>284.77</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Library of Ireland</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Crawford Gallery Cork</td>       <td>290</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, funding for the NCIs increased from &euro;48.9m in 2020 to &euro;60.2m in 2021; an increase of 23% in a single year.Funding was provided to these institution as supports and mitigation measures in response to Covid19.</p><p>Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of arts centres, many of which were initiated and funded by local authorities and supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department.  Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country.  In response to COVID-19, my Department opened a further capital stream (Stream D) of funding specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening. Under this stream capital funding is provided to assist in the re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues as part of Project Ireland 2040. Capital grants of up to &euro;10,000 have been provided to arts and culture facilities including to allow them to re-open safely.To date 95 SLAs have been issued with grants totalling almost &euro;670,000. Full details and application form are published on my Departments website at the following link :</p><p>.  </p><p>The National Cultural Institutions  also received once off COVID support through B6 totalling &euro;1.7m. A number annually funded bodies  such as Archbishop Marsh&rsquo;s Library, The Hunt Museum, etc. also got additional support of &euro;1m in total.  In addition,  a new once-off scheme for audience re-engagement for regional, rural and specialised museums allocated a total of &euro;363,150 to 33 projects. Details of expenditure can be viewed on the Departments websites as follows;  </p><p> </p></reply>

Government will meet later in the week to consider next steps in reopening the economy and society.   In addition, as part of the development of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will also be considering how we will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including sectors such as tourism. </p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Plan submitted to me by the Tourism Recovery Taskforce last year will continue to be an important consideration for me as I evaluate additional measures to support the recovery of the sector. The Recovery Oversight Group will keep me apprised of progress with regard to implementation of the Recovery Plan and the recovery of the sector more generally.  The group presented it first report to be on the 15th February. I have brought this report to the attention of my colleagues in Government and I will keep the report under consideration as we prepare the National Economic Recovery Plan. </p>  <p>  In the more medium term, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This new policy will set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. Central to developing a more resilient and sustainable tourism sector will be an increased focus on regional growth and season extension to deliver greater visitor dispersal throughout the country with a more even spread of demand across the year. I am very aware of the important role that Tourism plays as a driver of rural economies and I am committed to a continued focus on the potential of tourism to facilitate the development of our islands. </p></reply>

The plan committed to the development of sectoral guidance for very large purpose built event facilities, for example: stadia, auditoriums, conference or event centres. </p><p>I have recently established a Live Entertainment Working Group in order to facilitate stakeholder consultation and develop COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  The Group includes stakeholders from across the live entertainment sector as well and those with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events.  The Group will produce a high level principles set of guidance that all venue promoters can adopt for their specific purposes. The first meeting of this group was held on the 21 April 2021. </p><p>The Arts Council and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have also entered into a strategic partnership to develop guidance for the safe presentation of festivals and live events. This document is currently at the consultation stage and is due to be published shortly</p><p>While the timeframe for the resumption of entertainment events remains uncertain and, is dependent on public health considerations, it is critical that a set of COVID-19 guidelines is developed and ready in advance of the re-opening of the sector.</p><p>Funding of almost &euro;6m has been allocated in Budget 2021 to meet existing commitments pertaining to Ireland&rsquo;s hosting of the Ryder Cup in 2027 and to fund potential future bids for major events. Such events not only have benefits for sport, they can also contribute to economic growth and have the potential to help in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>When the epidemiological position allows the Department will facilitate the practical work of hosting test events and refining our approach to ensure a safe return for spectators to sports events.</p><p>While the report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group was recently published on the 1<sup>st</sup>April 2021 the immediate focus is being placed on establishing an agile rapid test knowledge group, which will enable information on validated tests and sampling to be widely shared across government departments, agencies and sectors. While it is not intended for rapid tests to replace PCR testing it does however have a role to play as another valuable tool in Ireland&rsquo;s battle against COVID-19. </p></reply>

Together with horizontal measures introduced by Government, such as the EWSS and the CRSS, the sector-specific measures I have introduced to date, including the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, the schemes for Inbound Tour Operators and Coach Tourism Operators, the Covid Adaptation Scheme, and the Outdoor Dining Scheme are key in helping tourism businesses to survive and adapt.  Government has also made it clear that there will be no 'cliff-edge' end to supports.</p>  <p>   As part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, Government will be outlining how it will help people return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism, which will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens.  </p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 to me on September 30th last. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic. Those recommendations have provided significant input into Government deliberations in considering measures to assist the sector.   The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group presented its first report to me in February, setting out progress to date in the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan, as well as areas it identified as requiring attention. The Oversight Group noted and welcomed the progress that has been made to date, both in terms of the broader employee and business supports and the tourism-specific measures I have introduced. The reports produced by the Group can be accessed on www.gov.ie/tourismrecoverytaskforce </p>  <p>  I continue to engage with the sector on a regular basis and in particular through the Hospitality and Tourism Forum.  This forum was established by the T&aacute;naiste and I last year in order to provide a platform to assess the continuing impact of the pandemic, to help improve understanding and responses to the crisis and to discuss ideas for recovery measures, thus assisting the Government in formulating its on-going response to the crisis. The Forum has met three times to date and is scheduled to meet for the fourth time next month. </p>  <p>  In line with our Programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This new policy will set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.</p></reply>

My Department is a key partner with the Department of Education in the delivery of Creative Youth, the plan for children and young people under Creative Ireland.</p><p>The delivery of this plan includes two key measures: the Creative Schools initiative, led by the Arts Council with support from both Departments, and Creative Clusters which is led by Department of Education in association with Education Support Centres Ireland.</p><p>Ireland launched the Creative Youth Plan, a strategy to enable the creative potential of every young person, in December 2017.  Seeking to create a place where knowledge and creativity are equal partners in the formation of our young people giving them an opportunity to become creative, active citizens, Creative Youth sets out measures to</p><p>- Expand young people&rsquo;s access to creative initiatives and activities,</p><p>- Focus on the inclusion of every child, and</p><p>- Support positive and sustainable outcomes for children and young people through creative engagement across formal and non-formal settings. </p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme has seen many significant contributions to achieving the best possible outcomes for children and young people.  Enhancing arts and creativity initiatives in school-based settings has been complemented by improving cross-sectoral collaboration to support creativity for children and young people in the community.  </p><p>Harnessing the creative potential of our people and communities is a cornerstone of the Creative Ireland Programme, and particularly through our Creative Communities initiative. In each of the 31 local authorities the Creative Ireland Programme has established a Culture and Creativity Team which brings together local expertise in arts, culture, heritage, libraries, enterprise and community engagement, to foster collaboration and spark new initiatives. A local Creative Ireland Co-ordinator has also been appointed for each local authority.  With the help of local artists, creatives, cultural and heritage organisations and community groups across the country, each local authority created a five-year <i>Culture and Creativity Strategy 2018 &ndash; 2022.</i>These are locally-led and designed to enable people to work together to transform their communities, their lives and their environment through creativity.</p><p>The Arts Council is the Irish government agency for developing the arts.The Council works in partnership with artists, arts organisations, public policy makers and others to build a central place for the arts in Irish life. The Arts Council supports and promotes children and young people&rsquo;s engagement with the arts from birth to early adulthood. </p><p>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Ireland in 1992, recognises children&rsquo;s right to participate in the arts and cultural life; and to express themselves freely in the medium of their choice, including in the form of art. The Convention also recognises children&rsquo;s right to an education that enables them to develop to their full potential. The Arts Council considers opportunities for children to learn and develop artistic skills, and to experience the arts, as essential to realising these rights.</p></reply>

Following exceptional demand for the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme  in 2020, a fund of &euro;25m is  now being made available through my Department for 2021. The scheme will provide significant job opportunities in the live performance sector. It will support the continued production of high quality artistic output, as was demonstrated during the pilot phase of the Live Performance Support Scheme, which recently provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians when no other opportunities were available.</p>  <p>  As a further support measure for those in the live music entertainment industry, I  recently announced funding of up to &euro;14m for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports. Self-employed businesses whether sole traders, partnerships and incorporated entities operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  &euro;5m will be allocated by my Department to local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances in summer 2021 animating town centres for local communities, should public health considerations permit.  It will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events. Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.</p>  <p>  A separate &euro;5m is being made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process.</p>  <p>  &euro;1 million was allocated for the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival 2021 to support the employment of performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021  curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations that will be broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel over six days and nights, marking the national day.</p>  <p>  Through Culture Ireland's programmes my Department continues to promote Irish arts abroad. These include a regular grant round programme which operates on the basis of 5 grant rounds per year and currently supports online presentation of Irish artists globally. </p>  <p>  Culture Ireland also continues to operate its showcase programme, designed to generate further opportunities for Irish artists by supporting the presentation of their work to international programmers. </p>  <p>  Recent activity includes the digital showcasing of  11 Irish bands as part of the Music from Ireland Showcase at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in 18 &ndash; 19 March. Upcoming is The Great Escape, (usually an in-person event in Brighton, GB) from 13 &ndash; 15 May where five recorded performances will be showcased online.</p>  <p>  Culture Ireland for the first time ever curated an online 5 day festival running from 17-21 March which was designed to celebrate Irish arts worldwide at a time when Irish artists normally travel the globe, presenting and sharing our culture on international stages. The festival, entitled SEODA, was an ambitious programme to ensure Irish artists reached audiences worldwide, including the diaspora and new audiences where Irish artists may not have travelled previously. The festival was also available free online in Ireland.</p></reply>

By the closing date, 3,106 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received. </p><p>The scoring system and assessment manual for the 2020 round has now been finalised and is available at <i>www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie</i>. Given the record number of applications and the detailed information contained in each application, the assessment process will take a number of months to complete.  It is envisaged that allocations to applications for equipment- only will be made first during the Summer with allocations to other capital projects announced before the end of the year.</p><p>In relation to larger projects, the National Sports Policy published in 2018 provided for the establishment of a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the SCEP. </p><p>Approximately &euro;86.4m of this allocation has already been awarded to 33 proposals and the priority in the short term is on advancing these projects. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF which is expected to be complete in the coming months. This review will consider, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded including to previously unsuccessful applications. The timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

To date 52 pools have been completed and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme. </p>  <p>  Exchequer support for any new swimming pool projects is now being provided under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF).  The LSSIF was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects including swimming pools with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027. Provisional grants to 8 swimming pool projects under the LSSIF were awarded in January 2020. Those projects are now at various stages of a due diligence process. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF Programme which is expected to be complete in the coming months. This review will consider, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and whether any additional grants should be awarded. The timing of any new call for proposals will also be considered. Any new allocations or a new call for proposals will be dependent on receiving additional funding for the LSSIF following the completion of the review of the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  In relation to future swimming pool needs, the National Sports Policy 2018 -2027 (NSP), launched on 25 July 2018, commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. This will involve close collaboration with relevant Government Departments, Local Authorities, sporting bodies and other stakeholders. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sport Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 is nearing completion and will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in the early stages of that Action Plan.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 254 of the Act provides for a street furniture licensing system for prescribed appliances and structures, placed on, above, under or along a public road, including footpaths.

Section 154(5)(b) provides that an enforcement notice shall require that such steps as may be specified in the notice be taken within a specified period, including, where appropriate, the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure and the discontinuance of any use and, in so far as is practicable, the restoration of the land to its condition prior to the commencement of the development.</p>  <p>  Section 154(5)(c) further provides that if the steps specified in the enforcement notice are not taken within a specified period (not being more than 6 months), the planning authority may enter on the land and take such steps ... and may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in that behalf.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 154(5)(d) provides that an enforcement notice shall require the person or persons served with the notice to refund to the planning authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority, including costs incurred in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers. </p>  <p>  Section 154(7) further provides that if required, any expenses reasonably incurred by a planning authority may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person or persons on whom the notice was served. Alternatively, the costs incurred by a planning authority may be secured by charging the land under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, or where the person on whom the enforcement notice was served is the owner of the land, an instrument vesting the ownership of the land in the authority subject to a right of redemption by the owner within five years. </p>  <p>  Section 156 sets out the penalties that may be applied in relation to non-compliance with specific sections of the Act. In this connection, 156(1) provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.  It further provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall  be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both.  Under section 156(2) of the Act, where a person is convicted of an offence and there is a continuation by him/her of the offence after his/her conviction, he or she shall be guilty of a further offence on every day on which the contravention continues and for each such offence shall be liable.   </p>  <p>  Accordingly, as indicated, there are already extensive enforcement powers available to planning authorities in relation to non-compliance with planning legislation. Said planning legislation is in compliance with EU law and applies to all forms of development, including the operation of quarries. Under section 157(4)(AA), enforcement action may be taken against unauthorised quarrying at any time.    </p>  <p>  With regard to the corporate governance of local authorities, it is the responsibility of the Chief Executive and the elected members to ensure that sound systems of financial management and internal control are in place in relation to the operations of local authorities.  The Audit Committee of a local authority also has a role in this regard. According to the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee has an independent role to advise the Council on financial reporting processes, internal control, risk management and other audit related matters.</p>  <p>  Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement issue, with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned. </p>  <p>  While I do not envisage that any further actions are required in relation to planning enforcement at this time, I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.</p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child subject to no maximum.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.1048.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800099#WRV01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 448 together.</p><p>A foreshore licence was granted under section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended, to RWE Renewables Ireland Limited in January 2021 for the purpose of undertaking surveys to provide supplementary environmental information to inform the preliminary design for the proposed Dublin Array wind farm and ancillary infrastructure in the vicinity of the Kish and Bray Banks. (Application Reference Number FS007029). Similar licences have been recently granted to Codling and SSE (Braymore point) for site investigation works on the east coast. Full details of the licence applications and the material upon which decisions were based are available to view on my Department's website.</p><p> </p><p>As part of the consideration of these foreshore licence applications, input was sought from a number of expert prescribed bodies such as such as the Marine Institute, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and Inland Fisheries Ireland, among several others. The observations of these bodies were considered as part of the overall assessment of the projects and they informed some of the specific conditions which were attached to the licences granted in these cases. The licence applications were also subjected to a thorough environmental assessment as well as a public interest test which considered the wider implications of allowing the site investigation works on the Foreshore to proceed.</p><p>In addition, a public consultation was held on the Foreshore licence applications which gave the public an opportunity to lodge any observations or objections they had to the proposed site investigation works. The submissions received from the public along with the responses to these from the applicants were fully considered in making a decision on the licence applications. </p><p>The Programme for Government established a 2030 ambition of 5GW from offshore renewable energy (ORE) sources for the East Coast area, which, at peak production, would be sufficient to meet the State&rsquo;s current peak electrical demand, significantly contributing to our 2030 target of 70% renewable electricity. My Department is currently in the process of finalising the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) which provides a long-term framework for effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources. The NMPF is intended to enable Government to set a clear direction for managing our seas, clarify objectives and priorities, and direct decision makers, users and stakeholders towards more strategic, plan-led and efficient use of marine resources. Under this framework, proposals that assist the State in meeting the Government&rsquo;s 2030 ORE targets and proposals that maximise the long-term shift from use of fossil fuels to renewable electricity, in line with decarbonisation targets, should be supported.</p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the issue of diverse levels and standards of communications between the fisheries and ORE industries, having first been raised by members of the fisheries community at a National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) public consultation meeting in Arklow held on 10 February 2020, which was one of a number of NMPF public consultation events held by the Marine Planning Policy and Legislation (MPPL) team across 2019 and early 2020. To address these concerns, and to promote constructive engagement and consultation between the fisheries community and the ORE industry, my Department intends to commence the formation of a Seafood and ORE working group, with the initial aim of agreeing a communications protocol between these two strategically important Marine sectors. Consultations on the draft terms of reference are ongoing between my Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and other relevant public sector bodies. These consultations are expected to be finalised shortly. </p><p>While the initial focus of the proposed group will be to formalise a consultation/engagement process between the two industries, it is the intention of my Department, that in the longer term, the Seafood/ORE group address a number of issues that impact fishers, including the impact of developments (including exploration of development sites) dislocation, and co-existence. My Department intends to commence the Seafood/ORE working group before the end of Q2 2021.</p></reply>

Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between myself and my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness, fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies, and it will be important that their views can form part of the process in developing the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Upon my appointment as Minister, I established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce, to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness. The Taskforce is also inputting on the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in the Programme for Government.

Following from this my Department is engaged in further scoping activity in respect of the Strategy.

It extends the delivery of Housing First nationally, with the introduction of targets for each local authority. The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Implementation Plan, Housing First is being delivered on a regional basis by the local authorities and the HSE. Contracts for the delivery of services have been put in place in each of the nine regions responsible for the delivery of homeless services with tenancies now in place in every region. At the end of 2020, a total of 508 individuals were being housed under the Housing First programme including 392 individuals who have been housed since the publication of the National Implementation Plan. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the further expansion of Housing First. Research is currently being undertaken by the Housing Agency to carry out an assessment of need for the supports provided by Housing First.

Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts. They roam freely throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country. </p>  <p>  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of my Department, nor indeed would it be generally possible, to cordon them onto specific areas of land. Moreover, fencing the National Park would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons:</p>  <p>  - The presence of deer is not confined to the National Parks and so fencing of these properties would serve no practical purpose in terms of wild deer control or management.</p>  <p>  - Killarney National Park alone is over 10,000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain. Fencing this area would be an enormous task which is unlikely to result in the desired objective.</p>  <p>  - Sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is 8 inches off the ground while Red deer are capable of knocking fences that are preventing them from reaching traditional feeding and shelter grounds.</p>  <p>  - The erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the Park.</p>  <p>  In the case deer on private property, landowners may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p></reply>

It is a joint strategy between my Department and the Department of Health which sets out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities through mainstream housing policy.  The Strategy was developed as part of a coherent framework of housing and health care supports for people with disabilities and compliments the Government&rsquo;s mental health policies as set out in the strategy documents - A Vision for Change and the Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings Time to Move On (2011).  </p>  <p>  Housing accommodation for perons with a disability can be provided by the local authorities and approved housing bodies with funding from central government through two mainstream capital programmes; the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF). </p>  <p>  Persons with disabilities are entitled to apply for a housing support assessment in the same manner as other citizens. If they have specific needs and these are specified as a basis of application, and supported by medical evidence, they will be taken into account in allocating a dwelling as local authorities strive to provide housing that is tailored to the needs of the individual to enable them to manage their disability in a more effective manner. In the case of private rented accommodation a person with a disability may source their own accommodation and be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  </p>  <p>  Persons with a disability make up approximately 8% of those on local authority housing waiting lists. Since 2016, allocations of homes to persons with a disability  has ranged from 10-12% of all allocations which is positive. The existing strategy is under review and public consultation and research has begun. It is intended that a new strategy will be published by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The EPA produces an annual Public Supply Drinking Water Report and Private Supply Drinking Water Report, which provides an overview of the quality of drinking water in public and private supplies. The reports are based on the assessment of monitoring results reported to the EPA by Irish Water and the Local Authorities, and on EPA and Local Authority enforcement activities.</p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s latest report &lsquo;Drinking Water Quality in Public Supplies 2019&rsquo; published in July, shows that overall our water supplies are safe, with over 99% of water samples complying with safety limits. </p><p>The concentration limit for lead in drinking water is set by the European Union Drinking Water Directive.  This is transposed into Irish Law through the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations.  The recently adopted recast of the Drinking Water Directive (EU 2020/2184) will progressively reduce the legal limit for lead from 10 μg/l to 5 μg/l over a transitional period of 15 years.</p><p>The 'National Strategy to Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water' was published in June 2015.  This strategy is to guide actions that will reduce people&rsquo;s lifetime exposure to lead from drinking water to the lowest possible levels.  It is considered that the safest approach to protecting health is to remove lead from all pipework in the public network and from pipes within houses and buildings.</p><p>Irish Water is responsible for dealing with lead in the public pipe network. In the period from 2014 to 2020 Irish Water has removed 35,666 lead service pipes.  While Irish Water is progressively removing all remaining lead pipes from the public water network over time, in the interim they have put in place a water treatment programme to protect consumers from lead exposure while this replacement programme is implemented.</p><p>The Lead Mitigation Advisory Group, which is chaired by officials from my Department, meets to consider and make recommendations on the broader Irish Water Lead Mitigation Strategy and to consider appropriate guidelines and criteria for Irish Water&rsquo;s decision-making process for lead mitigation measures. The most recent of these meetings took place on 9 March 2021.</p><p>Plumbing within a property boundary is the responsibility of the property owner.  Based on the most current data, Irish Water estimate that approximately 180,000 residential properties may have some lead pipework. </p><p>My Department has introduced a grant scheme to assist owners of premises connected to a domestic water supply with the costs of replacing lead piping or related fittings in homes.  Information on how to apply for this grant is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p></reply>

One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF).</p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from my Department. The remainder of the capital is borrowed from private institutions, or the Housing Finance Agency. </p><p>Local authorities, as the statutory housing authorities, are the decision makers in relation to the suitability of a proposed social housing project. For example, local authorities are required to ensure that any project appropriately reflects the housing need in that particular area and that there is sufficient need in the area to support the units over time; the properties comply with relevant standards and regulatory requirements; and the objectives of creating and maintaining sustainable communities are being met. The facility is only available as part of a project where the AHB makes homes available under a Payment &amp;amp; Availability  agreement to nominees of the housing authority for a set period of time.</p><p>My Department does not release specific information at a project level as these transactions are commercially sensitive and contain proprietary information that may impact on the competitiveness of the Approved Housing Body sector.  However, it can be confirmed that the Payment and Availability Agreement will be in place for 30 years. </p><p>Blackbanks View comprises of 40 high-quality homes for social housing use, that was progressed by the AHB, Cluid Housing, in the location referred to, working in partnership with Dublin City Council. The project has the support of the local authority and has met all of the requirements for funding, in line with Departmental policies and financial assessments. My Department issued a CALF approval for this Turnkey project in January 2021. This project was completed in April 2021.</p></reply>

This is usually achieved by either a rent free period up front or a discount on the lease payment over the term of the lease (or part thereof).  When this is taken into account, it is estimated that the average cost of Part V lease units approved to date in 2021 is &euro;18,049 annually over the term of the lease.  It is important to note that the  Part V leased units approved to date in 2021 are largely in Dublin.

The consultation phase considered the main ways in which architecture and our built environment affect society, our health and wellbeing and our ability to prosper. These include climate adaptation and mitigation and sustainable development, the benefits for everyone of obtaining high quality in the built environment, the protection and reuse of our built heritage, ways we can demonstrate built environment leadership and the need to foster education about our built environment.  My Department invited online and written submissions, and social media engagement, alongside a series of workshops and meetings, including virtual workshops in line with public health restrictions, to allow wide-ranging involvement in the drafting of the new policy, as well as consideration of the effect of Covid-19 on our built environment.</p>  <p>  The new Policy will be informed by the feedback that was received from the consultation phase, with over 150 submissions, as well as by a review of the previous policy.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that the new National Policy on Architecture will play an integral part in implementing our vision for the future, providing policy actions that will encourage best quality in researching, understanding, managing, enhancing and reusing our existing built environment assets as well as delivering sustainable new places and spaces.</p>  <p>  My Department is also following the emerging New European Bauhaus initiative, which was launched in January 2021 by the Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen. The Bauhaus will link directly to the priorities and funding streams of the Green Deal, therefore it is important that the National Policy on Architecture is aligned with this Europe-wide built environment initiative. </p>  <p>  I hope to circulate the draft policy to key stakeholders and Government Departments for observations in the next few weeks and I will also consult with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at that time.  Publication of the final policy will follow on from this consultation.</p></reply>

I have asked my Department to work with the National Bathing Water Expert Group, and with stakeholders, to specifically examine the feasibility and implications of expanding the bathing water season and / or the designation of additional bathing waters given the recent increase in sea swimming. </p><p>The Bathing Water Regulations 2008 (as amended), transpose the requirements of the 2006 Bathing Water Directive into national legislation. These regulations set the framework for the effective management of bathing waters around the country. The regulations also aim to improve health protection for bathers and ensure adequate information is disseminated in a timely manner during the bathing season.</p><p>It is important to note that in the latest bathing water report for 2019, which was published by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2020, 95% of bathing waters met or exceeded the minimum required standard. This is up from 94% in 2018 and improvements in bathing water quality are welcome and necessary.</p><p>Currently in Ireland there are almost 150 designated bathing waters identified by local authorities with the help of public consultation.  The water quality in these areas is monitored during the bathing season. The regulations define the bathing season to mean the period from 1st June to 15th September in any calendar year and also set out the sampling and monitoring requirements for all designated bathing waters.</p><p>My Department chairs the National Bathing Water Expert Group which advises on the implementation of the regulations, and collaborates on addressing significant issues as they arise. The current membership of the group includes: </p><p>- Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage,</p><p>- the Health Service Executive,</p><p>- the Environmental Protection Agency,</p><p>- Water Safety Ireland,</p><p>- An Taisce, </p><p>- Coastwatch,</p><p>- Local Authorities, and</p><p>- Irish Water.</p><p>The key functions of the Bathing Water Expert Group are to:</p><p>- Advise me on matters relating to bathing water protection policy;</p><p>- Advise the relevant implementation bodies regarding the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive in Ireland;</p><p>- Develop guidance for the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive;</p><p>- Evaluate priority actions critical to delivering Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Bathing Water Directive; and </p><p>- Provide a national view with respect to developments relating to the Bathing Water Directive and feed this through to the EU Commission and the EU Bathing Water Expert Group.</p></reply>

Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return waste water safely to the environment. In turn, the EPA, as environmental regulator, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the necessary quality standards for the collection and treatment of waste water discharges.</p>  <p>  The direct discharge of untreated sewage directly to the environment is clearly not a tenable situation, and one which I earnestly wish to see addressed as soon as possible. When Irish Water was established in 2014, they inherited a system in need of very significant improvement.  To date, the company has halted the discharge of raw sewage from the equivalent of 100,000 people in 15 towns across Ireland, removing half of all the raw sewage discharged.  Irish Water continues to develop and implement a long-term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and waste water system.</p>  <p>  Storm-water overflows are a usual feature of a combined storm water and waste water drainage system, and are designed to ensure that sewers do not flood streets, businesses and homes - which would be a serious and immediate threat to public health.  The water that is released from storm-water overflows happens after heavy or prolonged spells of rain, and has been heavily diluted with rainwater.  However, these overflows must be designed, maintained or upgraded so as to minimise the frequency of these discharges.</p>  <p>  The Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million and is now overloaded. In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant.

This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area. </p>  <p>  In respect of upgrades relating to Dublin Bay, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million and is now overloaded. In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant. This upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to cater for the growing population of the Greater Dublin Area and will address compliance with EU law.  Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019, and the project is currently underway. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.   Given a legacy of underinvestment in water services infrastructure in Ireland, the scale of remedial work necessary in our water and wastewater systems will take a number years and investment cycles to fully resolve.  </p>  <p>  It is recognised that our waste water networks require ongoing and sustained investment to bring these up to the required standard of treatment; to deal with population growth; and to adapt to the impacts of climate change. In this regard, significant investment in waste water infrastructure continues and is provided for in the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan. It is estimated that &euro;1.9 billion will be invested in waste water projects between 2019 to 2024.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas. Ireland's approach is to recognise the traditional right to cut turf for domestic purposes, while balancing this with our obligations under the Habitats Directive. This balanced approach is based on a respect for and understanding of that tradition and has been carefully nurtured to build trust and work with stakeholders to save the natural heritage of Ireland's bogs. </p>  <p>  In that context, the National Peatlands Strategy recognises that domestic turf cutters have a traditional right to cut turf for their own use and that this right is balanced with the conservation objectives for designated bogs and the legal obligations on the State.</p></reply>

Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery.  Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge.</p>  <p>  The research referred to by the Deputy was conducted by Inner City Helping Homeless via their listening service &lsquo;BABS&rsquo;.  I will be continuing to accord priority to working with my colleagues in Government to ensure the delivery of the appropriate responses to the issues which are the focus of this report and to addressing homelessness more generally.  These issues are also closely inter-related with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery matters.</p>  <p>  The High Level Homelessness Taskforce I established on my appointment as Minister and which continues to meet regularly is providing a forum for engagement with key front line organisations working to address issues such as these. </p></reply>

This funding programme was introduced in 2014 and has to the end of 2020 returned 16,102 properties to use with funding of &euro;229m from my Department.</p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department rolled out the largest ever voids funding programme with additional funding of &euro;40m secured by me under the July Stimulus Programme. Overall funding of &euro;58.3m was made available to local authorities towards 3,607 vacant local authority homes last year.</p>  <p>  Under the Energy Efficiency Programme, my Department funds the carrying out of retrofitting works to local authority dwellings. From 2013-2020 the Programme was implemented in 2 Phases: Phase 1 Attic Insulation/Cavity Wall Insulation and Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrades to dwellings. Over the period 2013 to 2020 over 73,500 units of social housing stock have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;161m under the scheme (most of which were completed under Phase 1).</p>  <p>  Under the Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, my Department funds local authorities in carrying out necessary adaptation works to local authority properties to cater for the needs of elderly and disabled tenants and families living in overcrowded conditions in local authority properties. Since 2011 my Department has provided exchequer funding of some &euro;120m to support this programme. </p>  <p>  Under the Regeneration Scheme, my Department funds programmes of estate regeneration in a number of targeted areas around the country. These projects seek to address the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration. Projects being funded under the Programme target the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged communities, including those defined by the most extreme social exclusion, unemployment and anti-social behaviour. Since 2015 over &euro;300m of exchequer funding has been provided to support this programme.</p>  <p>  Since 2011 my Department has provided funding of over &euro;800m under the above stock improvement schemes.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under various stock improvement programmes support this approach.</p></reply>

The funding was allocated in the form of a grant scheme, open to the 69 licensed establishments in Ireland. This was aimed primarily at preventing an animal welfare crisis as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  While the State does not ordinarily provide funding to the zoo sector, these measures were put in place in the context of the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect it has had on these establishments.</p>  <p>  The fund was to cover zoos&rsquo; ongoing costs in relation to maintaining animal welfare standards during the winter period.  As well as having responsibility for licensing, inspection and regulation of zoos, my Department is responsible for ensuring compliance with welfare standards in accordance with the Irish Standards of Modern Zoo Practice, which set out best practice and strict standards for animal well-being. </p>  <p>  A fund of &euro;500,000 was available to assist small and medium size zoos and aquaria. A separate fund of &euro;1.1m was provided to the two largest zoos, Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park, in order to prevent these nationally important zoos from closing.</p>  <p>  This financial support recognised the vital role played by our zoos as networks for global conservation of biodiversity, as centres of learning and places where lifelong memories of families and children are made.  This emergency funding will also safeguard employment and stimulate local economies in recovering by ensuring the continued operation of viable zoo establishments throughout the country.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s NPWS has continued to monitor the situation closely and is in regular contact with zoos and aquaria, as well as the sector&rsquo;s representative body, on a range of issues including the positive impact of the funding in 2020 and what supports might be needed in 2021.</p></reply>

committed to its obligations under the Official Languages Act and associated legislation.  Section 11 of the Act provides for the preparation by a public body of a scheme, specifying the details of the services it proposes to provide through the official languages.</p><p>My Department published its fifth Language Scheme in May 2020.  The Scheme was developed to strengthen the emphasis given to the Irish language in the daily conduct of the Department&rsquo;s business, taking account of what is reasonably practicable over the next three years.  </p><p>The Scheme is available on the Department&rsquo;s website in the Irish language at and in the English language at .</p><p>Customers that wish to engage with the Department through the Irish language will be responded to either in writing or orally, in Irish.  Arrangements have been put in place within the Department to have Irish speakers available for oral communication.  Both in-house and external translators are consulted for all written communication received and responded to in Irish, to ensure that the service provided is of a high quality.</p><p>In general, my Department does not receive forms from members of the public but will continue to supply local authorities with circulars and associated forms in a bilingual format, where such documents are used directly by local authority staff to provide services to members of the public.</p><p>The ongoing implementation of the language planning process has a statutory footing under the Gaeltacht Act 2012, which is the primary driver in support of the commitment to the achievement of the objectives set out in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030.</p><p>This is recognised in the National Planning Framework (NPF), which refers to the preparation and implementation of language plans at community level.  Objective 29 of the NPF &ldquo;supports the implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks&rdquo;.</p><p>Separately, the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, sets out mandatory objectives for local authorities, which must be addressed in the drafting of their County Development Plan governing local development policies.  Section 10(2) of the Act includes a requirement that, where there is a Gaeltacht area within the planning authority&rsquo;s territory, the development plan must include provisions and objectives for &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo;.</p><p>My Department does not maintain the requested information in respect of the State bodies under its aegis.  These State bodies may be contacted directly by

Since July 2019, the RTB can proactively monitor the rental sector and investigate and sanction landlords who engage in certain breaches of rental law, including the none-registration of tenancies. An important aspect of this regulatory role is that the RTB can commence investigations both on information received from members of the public as well as by using open source data and data available to the RTB, as outlined in the legislation. If a landlord is found to have committed a breach, a sanction can be applied ranging from a formal written caution to a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs of up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  My Department does not collect the data sought, however the Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.  Following the issue of Circular LG (P)05/16 on 20 September 2016 from my Department, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose.

Managing the registration of tenancies is a core function of the RTB. This allows the RTB to collect and provide definitive data on the rental sector and for transparency across the rental sector through the public register of tenancies; thus, enabling the RTB to better understand and regulate the sector.</p>  <p>   In relation to incidents of non-compliance, there are two processes in the RTB which have failure to register within their remit, the Registration Enforcement Process and the Investigations and Sanctions Process.</p>  <p>  The RTB has registration enforcement powers to pursue landlords who have not complied with their obligation to register their tenancies. Failure to register is an offence which may result in a criminal conviction, a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. The RTB makes every effort to inform landlords of their obligations to register and legal action is taken as a last resort.</p>  <p>  The RTB, receives information from different sources regarding whether a tenancy is registered or not, including local authorities, members of the public, RTB checks and follow-ups and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The RTB writes to landlords directly and gives them opportunities to comply before legal action is taken. The majority of landlords who are contacted are already complying with their obligation or then comply with their obligation to register which halts any requirement for the formal enforcement process. However, in a small number of cases formal notices and Solicitor Letters must be issued. </p>  <p>  The RTB has an Investigations and Sanctions unit dedicated to investigating certain potential breaches of rental law by a landlord called improper conducts.</p>  <p>   One of the breaches that can be investigated is a failure to register a tenancy with the RTB within one month of the tenancy commencing. The Investigations and Sanctions Unit can start an investigation either as a result of information received from members of the public or as a result of information gathered from records that the RTB has access to under the Residential Tenancies Act. </p>  <p>  If a landlord is found to have committed an improper conduct a sanction may be imposed on them by an independent Decision maker of a written caution and/or a monetary sanction of &euro;15,000 and &euro;15,000 in costs. All sanctions must be confirmed by the Circuit Court and all monetary sanctions are paid to the Exchequer.   </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.  Comprehensive information including guidance and frequently asked questions documentsin relation to tenancy terminations during the Covid-19 pandemic and on general tenancy matters is available on the RTB's website - .</p><p>A tenant or a landlord  may refer a matter to the RTB for dispute resolution services. </p><p>Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to provide legal advice, comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case.  A landlord or tenant might wish to seek independent legal advice in a particular case. </p><p>Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, and the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following:</p><p>- the tenant has failed to comply with the  obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;</p><p>- the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;</p><p>- the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;</p><p>- the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;</p><p>- the landlord requires the dwelling for own  or family member occupation;</p><p>- vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and/or </p><p>- the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.</p><p>The termination notice periods which landlords  must provide to tenants are detailed below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Duration of a Tenancy</th>       <th>Notice Period </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 6 months</td>       <td>28 days</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not less than 6 months but less than one year</td>       <td>90 days</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not less than one year but less than 3 years</td>       <td>120 days</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not less than 3 years but less than 7 years</td>       <td>180 days</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not less than 7 years but less than 8 years</td>       <td>196 days</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not less than 8 years</td>       <td>224 days</td>    </tr> </table> The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020. The Act aims to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on tenants and to support the Government's efforts to restrict the movement of people in order to suppress the spread of this virus.</p><p>The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. During such times, the required periods of termination notice are &quot;paused&quot;. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations.</p><p>A moratorium on evictions taking place was in operation throughout the country from 31 December 2020 until midnight 22 April 2021 (12 April plus the 10 day grace period), with limited exceptions. </p><p>Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA) provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 July 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 July 2021. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 July 2021, with no back-dating allowed. These protections are designed to better balance the legal rights of landlords and tenant; a guidance document on the PDRTA is available on the RTB's website -<i>www.rtb.ie.</i></p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 provided similar protections to the PDRTA, referred to directly above, during the period from 1 August 2020 to 10 January 2021, inclusive.</p></reply>

The scheme was open to all political parties on the Register of Political Parties on an opt-in basis.  The funding is in the form of an annual grant to political parties, based on their performance in fielding women candidates in the 2019 local elections.  This funding is to be used by the parties specifically for the purposes of promoting gender balance and diversity among the party&rsquo;s candidates and elected representatives. Examples of such activities could include the training of women candidates, the recruitment of diversity officers whose role would be to build the diversity of party membership and future local election candidates, active engagement with immigrant, traveller or disability groups, etc.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the scheme in 2019, nine political parties have applied for funding. The scheme is ongoing and consideration is now being given to how it can be improved to maximise impact ahead of the 2024 local elections.  Engagement with stakeholders is ongoing and a new scheme is likely to be announced in May 2021.</p>  <p>  Part III of the Electoral Act 1997 also provides for the making of payments out of the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to qualified parties.  Funding received by qualified parties can be used for the promotion of participation by women and young persons in political activity.</p>  <p>  A qualified party means a political party that is registered in the Register of Political Parties and whose candidates at the last preceding general election obtained not less than 2% of the total first preference votes obtained by all candidates at that election.</p>  <p>  Each qualified party is paid annually: a flat rate amount of &euro;126,974 and a share of an annual sum, which in 2019 stood at some &euro;4,948,200.  The share of the fund payable to a qualified political party is determined by expressing the first preference votes of the qualified party as a percentage of the total first preference votes received by all qualified political parties. The fund is linked to general pay in the civil service.</p></reply>

It is critical however that action against settlements must be both lawful and well-considered, since actions which are not fully thought-through risk ultimately being unwound, thereby undermining the cause they aim to support.</p>  <p>  In March 2016, the UN Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 31/36, calling upon the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce a database of all business enterprises involved in activities relating to Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.</p>  <p>  The terms of the Resolution as adopted by the UN Human Rights Council were very broad, with the associated risk that this could potentially lead to unfair and counter-productive outcomes. The EU Members of the HRC therefore abstained in the vote on the Resolution. Despite these reservations, Ireland fully cooperated with requests for assistance by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the task they had been assigned.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always sought to protect the independence of the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights and notes the High Commissioner&rsquo;s commitment to discharge the mandate of the HRC Resolution 31/36 in a legally, factually and methodological sound manner. The database was published by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in February 2020. The Human Rights Council did not specify implications for entities listed in the database or put forward recommendations on how the information therein be used. In her report to the Human Rights Council&rsquo;s 46th Session, the High Commissioner reported that it was not possible for her Office to update the database on an annual basis due to the substantial resource implications. </p>  <p>  In respect of procurement, this is governed by the relevant EU Directives, national rules and guidelines. The OHCHR database is not specified in EU procurement criteria for the award procedure of public contracts.  </p></reply>

The restrictions that are imposed on Palestinians undermine the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, a right which is at the heart of the Two-State solution. </p><p>Israel&rsquo;s actions in respect of settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are in contravention of its obligations under international law. Settlements and occupation are detrimental to the wider respect for Palestinians&rsquo; human rights, such as the right to water and education, and the enjoyment of civil and political rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. Settlements are also a key source of tension, violence and conflict across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where the situation is of particular concern.</p><p>Violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law are both a cause and consequence of the conflict and an impediment to a sustainable political solution. I have argued consistently at EU and UN level that there needs to be a greater focus on the actions in the occupied Palestinian territory which are unjust and which undermine the possibility of reaching a peace agreement, including settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions and expropriations, the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli security forces, restrictions on the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need, and restriction of access to water supplies. </p><p>We raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices resulting from the occupation on a regular basis with the Israeli authorities, as well as at EU and UN level, including at the Security Council. </p><p>We will continue to raise our concerns about human rights issues in the occupied Palestinian territory. The role of civil society is vital and we will continue to support space for civil society in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, and to provide financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs working on human rights issues. </p></reply>

I was disappointed to learn that the courts have refused bail in this case but I understand that certain essential items of personal care have been provided after judicial intervention. </p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in New Delhi has monitored this case since the detention of the human rights defender last October. The Embassy joined other EU Member States in raising the case with the National Human Rights Commission of India, expressing concern about the conditions of his detention, given the age and health profile of the human rights defender, and raising the possibility of his release on humanitarian grounds. However, the National Human Rights Commission having reviewed the circumstances of the arrest and detention, found that no protection applies on the grounds of infringement of human rights. </p><p>The case has been raised bilaterally with the Indian side by the Ambassador of Ireland at senior levels in the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, and jointly with EU partners, most recently during the EU-India Human Rights Dialogue which took place earlier this month in New Delhi.</p><p>The promotion of human rights, including the protection of human rights defenders, is a priority of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland expects the Indian authorities to have due regard for the wellbeing of the human rights defender in this case during his detention and to have full respect for the rule of law including presumption of innocence.</p><p>Our Embassy in New Delhi will continue to monitor developments in this case.</p></reply>

Under the Department&rsquo;s updated official vehicle management policy, and in line with our Green Foreign Ministry policy, new and replacement vehicle purchases must now comply with our policy of minimising our carbon footprint. Factors like pollutant emissions, fuel efficiency and noise levels are taken into account when preparing vehicle specifications. The procurement of electric vehicles is given strong consideration by default followed by consideration of hybrid options. However, it should be noted that some our Missions operate in difficult environments where security and health and safety issues will be a significant factor when deciding on an official vehicle.</p>  <p>  Overall, the Department owns 175 vehicles between its HQ and its 90 Missions abroad. Given the variety of locations in which the Department operates abroad, including locations where hybrid or electric vehicles are not viable options, it is not possible to provide estimated costs for replacing all vehicles owned by the Department with hybrid or electric models. However, in 2020 the Department completed the purchase of 14 vehicles (12 cars and 2 motorbikes) at a cost of &euro;361,339. Of the 12 cars, 8 were hybrid or electric, of which 5 replaced non-hybrid or electric models. The cost of the hybrid/electric vehicles was &euro;219,310. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to seek to purchase hybrid or electric vehicles wherever possible and expects to spend similar funds on such vehicles in the coming years. </p></reply>

I am aware of the over-arching matters outlined in same.  </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the Irish Coast Guard has had overall responsibility for the provision of Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue domain. From within the Defence Organisation, both the Naval Service and the Air Corps provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. A Service Level Agreement is in place setting out their roles and responsibilities in this regard.   </p>  <p>  No decision has yet been taken to change any aspect of the current delivery model of Search and Rescue (SAR) aviation services in Ireland's SAR domain. There is, as you are aware, an ongoing project under the remit of the Department of Transport, to consider, develop and bring to fruition a new Marine Search and Rescue aviation contract for future service provision. I endorse the process underway to date and I am satisfied with the Department of Transport&rsquo;s discernment in appointing experts and Steering Group members to this project. </p>  <p>  In the context of this ongoing process, late last year, I asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for SAR and represents value for money for the State.  This process is currently ongoing. I can confirm that a proposal by the AC, which includes costing material, has been shared with the Department of Transport by my Department as part of ongoing engagement. I have also met with the Minister for Transport in March on this matter. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next service will be a matter for Government once the detailed appraisal and business case has been finalised. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the process underway in South Dublin under Section 37A of the Education Act, 1998. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. As the legal process is still underway, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage. </p><p>Minister Foley and I also announced the establishment of a new special school (Our Lady of Hope School) in Crumlin, Dublin 12 last December. Both the NCSE and my Department are working closely with the patron and the school's management team on the practical arrangements required to progress this project as speedily as possible.</p><p>Finally, I can reassure the Deputy that the local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: <i>es-contact-list</i>. </p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Whether or not swimming lessons are offered would be a matter for each individual school based on their own context.</p>  <p>  The Physical Education (PE) curriculum at primary level contributes to children&rsquo;s overall development by helping them to lead full, active and healthy lives. It provides a balanced range of activities for children through the six strands, of which Aquatics is one.  The aquatics programme is concerned with gaining competence and confidence near, in, under and on water. The term &lsquo;aquatics&rsquo; is used to include not only the teaching of swimming strokes but the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play and other aspects of aquatics. The concern for water safety permeates all aquatic activities. However, the PE curriculum has been developed on the understanding that facilities available to schools vary. Consequently, it offers a level of flexibility that allows each individual school to design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to it. </p>  <p>  Currently,  the primary curriculum is undergoing a period of review and redevelopment led by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The new draft Primary Curriculum Framework was published in 2020 for public consultation. Phase one of the consultation ended in December 2020 and phase two, which will focus on consulting with school leaders, teachers, children and parents will commence in September 2021. This consultation will inform the direction of the new primary curriculum, with the completed draft framework expected to be published in Q2 2022 and the specifications for the curricular areas, including physical education, to be developed in the following years. </p></reply>

Whether or not swimming lessons are offered would be a matter for each individual school based on their own context.</p>  <p>  In the new Leaving Certificate Physical Education specification learners&rsquo; physically active participation is central to teaching and learning. To enable this to happen, students learn about the different theoretical perspectives through their participation in three different physical activities. These activities are selected from six distinct physical activity areas which reflect the activities more commonly included in school physical education programmes currently. In the Physical Activity area &lsquo;Aquatics&rsquo; students learn about water-based activities that utilise swimming and/or diving skills and techniques for performance water safety, or recreational purposes. Learners may choose one of the following activities Lifesaving, survival swimming, swimming strokes, water-polo, synchronised swimming.</p>  <p>  However, it is recognised that the particular context of the school, the physical education programme it can facilitate and the level of community facilities, will have a bearing on the level of choice that can be managed. The physical education teacher, in consultation with the learners, will agree the range of activities that can be accommodated and supported for their physical activity project.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health. It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department provides a comprehensive, school-based psychological service to all primary and post primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of all learners. NEPS provides its service to schools through casework and through support and development work for schools. Individual casework service involves a high level of psychologist collaboration with teachers and parents, often also working directly with the child/young person.  NEPS may become involved with supporting individual students where the school&rsquo;s Special Education Teaching team or Student Support Team feels that the involvement of the psychologist is needed. Psychologists may provide consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions to be delivered in the school setting and engage in direct work with an individual student as appropriate. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year in response to Covid 19. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  In the event that the need for a more specialised intervention or counselling is identified by the NEPS psychologist, or indeed the Student Support Team, children and young people and their families are signposted to external pathways for support.  The provision of child and adolescent mental health services including emotional counselling and therapeutic supports lies within the remit of the Department of Health, and the HSE specifically.</p></reply>

The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities at this time. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  A whole-school team approach is recommended in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  From the outset of this pandemic NEPS has continued to deliver a psychological service to schools within the context of public health advice. In addition, NEPS has remained proactive in the development of advice for schools, parents and pupils to support the wellbeing of students. NEPS psychologists have an increased focus on both consultation and casework in schools with particular attention to the needs of individual students.  Psychologists are taking a blended approach to the provision of casework to schools, working both remotely, and where appropriate in-school, depending on school protocols/plans and of the nature of need. </p>  <p>  NEPS is developing a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which includes trauma informed approaches.  The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The focus of the workshops is on exploring and understanding the sources and impact of stress on children and young people including attachment, trauma and adverse experiences. The emphasis will be on creating environments to reduce stress and on developing skills all children and young people need to better manage in school. The training will also cover the influences of stress on school staff and how to best to manage this. It is intended that staff will find the content useful in supporting their own wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings. The workshops are for all staff and all students including those with SEN or those children impacted by trauma and adverse experiences.</p>  <p>  Work is underway to identify schools for inclusion in a pilot of the workshops while being cognisance of prioritising teacher contact time in schools.  In selecting schools, a mix of DEIS, non DEIS and urban and rural schools will be included. Following the pilot a national roll-out is planned during the next academic year.   </p>  <p>  Restorative Practice is an evidence-based anti-bullying intervention and prevention strategy that is designed to help build understanding, encourage accountability and provide opportunities for healing. Schools that adopt Restorative Practice on a whole-school basis consistently demonstrate a variety of benefits in terms of both school management and student engagement. Restorative Practice supports are available to schools from the PDST Wellbeing Teams. Schools who are considering embedding Restorative Practice can avail of a once-off introductory session outlining the principles and processes of the approach, while schools who have already engaged in the process of Restorative Practice in their school can avail of follow-up in-school support visits.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need. </p>  <p>  A key part of the DEIS Plan was the introduction of a new DEIS identification process based on an objective, statistics based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme and all schools, including those referred to by the Deputy, will be considered under this process. However, until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that schools are resourced to support those most in need to have every opportunity to benefit from education in order to help them fulfil their potential in life.  </p>  <p>  In relation to teaching resources, the key factor for determining the level of teacher staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Special Education Teachers, the new model for allocating Special Education Teachers to mainstream schools was introduced from September 2017, based on the profiled needs of schools. The allocations were updated for schools with effect from September 2019, with limited readjustments being applied for at that time. The allocations have remained in place for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years, with some adjustments made over the course of the model for schools which achieved developing status, or successfully appealed on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising in their schools. Applications for an exceptional needs review are processed by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p></reply>

Sub Seeker has over 6,000 teachers currently registered.

The school are advised to contact the Schools Broadband Service Desk on 1800 334466. </p>  <p>  The school was included in a recent tender in line with contractual requirements, to renew the broadband service to the school, with final tender responses due shortly. Following the evaluation process of this tender, the school will be contacted in due course to arrange the new service, and it is hoped this may deliver higher speed connectivity.</p></reply>

It recognises and supports pupils&rsquo; engagement with Irish and English at different stages and rates along their language-learning journey. It builds on the language knowledge and experience that pupils bring to the school and recognises that pupils will be at various stages. Schools cater for a wide diversity of needs by providing a differentiated learning experience for pupils in an inclusive school environment for both Irish and English. This is informed by the benefits of bilingualism for all pupils, as well as the principles of inclusion that underpin the Primary Language Curriculum. All pupils should be encouraged to study Irish and achieve a level of personal proficiency that is appropriate to their own personal needs and ability.</p><p>The Progression Continua in the Primary Language Curriculum provide a framework for teachers to identify the pupil&rsquo;s stage of language development and to plan interventions that support the development of language skills and competences in Irish and in English in an integrated manner, emphasising the transferability of language skills across languages. Differentiation is a way of teaching in which teachers proactively modify curriculum, teaching methods, resources and learning activities in line with the identified needs of an individual and/or small groups of learners to maximize the learning opportunity for each learner in the classroom. The aim of differentiation is to ensure that each pupil can engage in purposeful and meaningful learning activities and to increase their motivation and enjoyment in order to support them in engaging with increasingly challenging tasks over time tasks over time. Teachers adapt teaching activities and resources in order that they build on the pupil&rsquo;s identified strengths in response to need. Teachers give consideration to the distinctive characteristics and learning styles of individual pupils. This enables pupils to make progress in their language-learning journey at a rate that is appropriate for them </p><p>The Special Education Teaching Allocation model also allows mainstream schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools based on their identified learning needs in school. The deployment and use of these resources is at the discretion of the school and is based on the availability of resources and the identified needs of its pupils. </p><p>The Department has no plans for a pilot scheme of remote learning support.</p><p>There were 1,777 new entrants with a source of &ldquo;School Abroad&rdquo; for the specified standards in 2019-20.</p><p> 2019  </p><p>New Entrant Pupil SourceStandardEnrolment </p><p>(Y/N)  DescriptionDescriptionper Return</p><p>YSchools Abroad  Second Class 443  </p><p>YSchools Abroad  Third Class452  </p><p>YSchools Abroad  Fourth Class451  </p><p>YSchools Abroad  Fifth Class431  </p><p>Grand Total1,777  </p></reply>

It will provide for the needs of children with autism and general learning disability up to eighteen years of age. </p><p>The provision will also provide for a change to the designation of St. Mary&rsquo;s Special School, Rochestown to also cater for children with a dual diagnosis of learning disability and autism with 12 new school places becoming available for September 2021.  </p><p>Priority will now be given to those children who currently do not have an offer of a school place for next September.</p><p>The provision of 60 additional special school placements is to cater for the immediate requirements. I can assure the Deputy that my Department and the NCSE continue to work towards the development of additional placements in the Cork area to meet ongoing and future demand. </p><p>The NCSE's local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) remains available to parents.

Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. </p><p>All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. </p><p>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.</p><p>In April 2018, then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in schools.</p><p>The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019.</p><p>The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p><p>The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. Both the primary and post primary SPHE/RSE Development Groups have been meeting virtually on a monthly basis since the groups were convened in October 2020. </p><p>The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and the first section of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycyle Short Course and Senior Cycyle SPHE Framework) is now published and a second section is due to be published at the end of April. </p><p>Further sections of the toolkit will be added over the coming weeks/months. To visit the recently updated primary toolkit go to this link </p><p>To visit the Junior Cycle toolkit go to this link </p><p>To visit the Senior Cycle toolkit go to this link </p><p>In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum as recommended in the NCCA Report has begun, with an initial focus on Junior Cycle. The review of the current Junior Cycle SPHE course has been completed and will be considered by the NCCA Council in June. This review contains a brief which will inform the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification, which will begin in September. A draft of the updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification will be available for public consultation in Q1 of 2022.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school. The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. My Department does not seek to intervene in the selection criterion that is applied by schools. </p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie </p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be diagnosed with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school may receive additional teaching support in schools.</p></reply>

This included two new post primary schools to be established to serve the Donaghmede_Howth_D13 school planning area.  The first of these, Belmayne ETSS, opened in 2019.  A new post primary was also announced for the Drumcondra_Marino_Dublin1 school planning area.</p>  <p>  The most recent projections for a number of the school planning areas in the North Dublin city area indicate increased requirements at primary and post primary levels.  My Department is currently working to examine the capacity of the schools in the area to meet this projected demand and to ensure that the timing of establishment of new schools aligns with need.</p></reply>

From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year and who are due to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools. All students have now returned to school. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. </p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools earlier last year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074/2020, &lsquo;Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.</p><p>The circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes, links to each of which are shown.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </i></p><p>The <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>site also contains information on well-being supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in my Department, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  </p><p>Adjustments were made to the assessment arrangements for the 2021 Leaving Certificate examinations to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by the students who are due to take these examinations.  I am conscious that current fifth year students have also experienced some disruption to their learning and this will be considered in planning for the 2022 Leaving Certificate.</p></reply>

The second contribution condition requires that a person must also have 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY). The GCY for 2021 is 2019.  At least 13 of these contributions must be paid. Where a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the GCY they can be from 2 years before the GCY, the last complete tax year or the current tax year.  Alternatively, a person could qualify if they have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding the GCY.</p>  <p>  The requirement to have paid contributions during this period is to demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce.</p>  <p>  The social insurance contribution requirements are not as high as for receipt of the State Pension, and people retiring at age 65, given they have a recent attachment to the workforce, should, in most cases meet the required PRSI conditionality.</p>  <p>  Where a person does not qualify for the Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds they may be eligible for support under the means tested Jobseeker's Allowance scheme subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions of that scheme.</p>  <p>  While the person concerned satisfies the first contribution condition, he does not satisfy the second contribution condition and therefore does not qualify for receipt of the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to amend the conditions of the scheme. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition, a participant may be eligible, where appropriate, for payments in respect of any qualified dependent adult and children.  </p><p>If a CE participant's underlying payment, to include dependents, is &euro;203 a week or less, they receive the minimum CE weekly rate of &euro;225.50, that is &euro;203 plus the top up of &euro;22.50.  If a participant's underlying payment, to include dependents, is &euro;203 or more<b>,</b>then they receive the same rate as their social welfare payment plus &euro;22.50.</p><p>CE participants can retain their medical card and can also retain the extra benefits they were entitled to on their underlying scheme prior to joining CE, for example Fuel Allowance, an increase for Living Alone, Living on an Island and Travel Pass, provided they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions for those benefits.</p><p>CE participants can also work outside of the 19.5 hours that they participant on CE. The income from this employment does not affect their CE payment rate. </p><p>A number of Social Welfare payment increases took effect in January 2021 as part of measures introduced by Government in Budget 2021. The weekly payments for qualified child dependents increased by &euro;5 to &euro;45 for children aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 to &euro;38 for children aged up to 12. Fuel Allowance, which is paid during the fuel season each year, was increased by &euro;3.50 to &euro;28 per week. The Living Alone Allowance increased by &euro;5 per week to &euro;19 and the Island Allowance, which is paid to people living on certain offshore islands, increased by &euro;7.30 to &euro;20 per week.  These increases benefitted many eligible CE participants.</p><p>I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants in particular given the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services. However, it is not my intention to increase the payment rates for CE participants at this time. </p></reply>

The Council's work has informed the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023, the development of the Automatic Enrolment Programme and the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG). </p><p>At my request, the Pensions Council is currently considering the merits of introducing an initiative similar to the Cost Transparency Initiative in the UK for pension providers in Ireland and has been asked to consider whether such an approach is effective on a voluntary basis, as in the UK, or operates better on a mandatory basis, such as in Denmark and in the Netherlands.</p><p>The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 - 2023 highlights the very large number of private pension schemes in Ireland and how this is a contributing factor in the level of professional fees charged to these schemes both for administration and investment advice.  It sets out a phased approach to reforming the pensions market, especially with respect to the rationalisation of pension schemes which it is anticipated will contribute considerably to lower pension costs and charges in the future.  For example, there are approximately 160,000 schemes on the Pension Authority&rsquo;s Register including occupational schemes, AVC schemes, Trust RACs and Death Benefit Only schemes.  The consolidation of small DC schemes and single member schemes into larger schemes (including into master trusts) will be a key driver of change with regards to scheme governance and achieving economies of scale in the Irish pensions market.  It should also result in considerably reduced administrative costs for such schemes. </p><p>The Pension Charges in Ireland Report (2012) stated that &quot;the proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations. International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employers.&quot; </p><p>In line with the Roadmap for Pension Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023, the Government has committed to develop and introduce an &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; (AE) supplementary retirement savings system.  My Department is currently working on design proposals for such a system.  The Programme for Government further commits that there will be a charges cap imposed on AE providers.  </p><p>I recently signed the Regulations to transpose the IORPS II Directive into Irish law.  Alongside the many reforms introduced by the Directive in the area of pension scheme governance, the Directive also provides for additional disclosure requirements in respect of fees and charges.  Pension Schemes are now required to draw up a clear and comprehensive Pension Benefit Statement for members containing &ldquo;a breakdown of the costs deducted by the scheme or trust RAC at least over the last 12 months&rdquo; and &ldquo;written in a clear manner, using clear, succinct and comprehensible language, avoiding the use of jargon and avoiding technical terms where everyday words can be used instead.&rdquo; </p><p>The Interdepartmental Pensions Reform &amp;amp; Taxation Group (IDPRTG) published its Report on Supplementary Pensions in November 2020.The report presented a number of recommendations to help advance the goal of simplifying and harmonising the supplementary pension landscape which will reduce complexity, enhance market competitiveness, drive product efficiencies and in turn lead to better retirement outcomes for pension savers.  An implementation group is actively working on the IDPRTG Report&rsquo;s recommendations. </p><p>It is acknowledged that improving the transparency of pension costs, rationalising the pensions market and improving scheme governance will drive price competition and lead to better outcomes for consumers.  My Department continues to progress several key initiatives which will help to achieve this. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The latest CSO data for March 2021, recorded a COVID-19 adjusted overall unemployment rate of 24.2 percent, with an equivalent measure for youth at 59.2 percent.</p><p>Research conducted by my Department last year suggests that part-time workers may have been particularly impacted in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, given their tendency to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely accommodation and food, and retail.</p><p>While many have been displaced from their employment by the pandemic, most of those currently in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will return to employment as restrictions ease and the economy re-opens. However, it is inevitable that some jobs will be permanently lost, and additional numbers of persons will require State support to find new jobs transitioning back to work.</p><p>I am acutely aware that when people lose their jobs and remain unemployed for some time they can become disconnected from the labour market. These individuals risk losing the vital social and work connections that are needed to identify and pursue work opportunities and for many it may be the case that their existing work experience and skills cannot easily translate into new sectors of employment. This can particularly be the case for part-time employees.</p><p>Therefore, my Department is supporting initiatives to assist people, including part-time workers, get back to work, once COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease. </p><p>Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures:</p><p>- Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months). Time spent in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment can be counted for the purposes of eligibility for all unemployed individuals.</p><p>- nFacilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.</p><p>- Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p><p>- Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p><p>- Increasing the funding available to all PUP recipients through the Training Support Grant from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000. The grant is designed to support quick access to short-term training where the training is not delivered by a State provider.</p><p>My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage businesses to provide jobseekers, including part-time workers, with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.</p><p>Those in self-employment, looking to reopen their business, may have other income support options available to them from my Department depending on their circumstances. A self-employed person can retain their PUP where their income from self-employment does not exceed &euro;960 over a rolling 8-week period and they continue to meet the scheme conditions. </p><p>Where a person exceeds this threshold and is engaging in regular limited self-employment, access to the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) has been extended to those who transition from the PUP.  Under this scheme, a self-employed recipient can engage in self-employment for up to 24 hours per week and retain a personal weekly rate of payment of &euro;128.60. A self-employed jobseeker with a qualified adult can be paid &euro;209.70 per week. Moreover, there is no earnings limit to receive the payment. </p><p>These efforts designed to support those displaced by COVID-19, including part-time workers, will be further bolstered by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department. Pathways to Work is the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy. It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market. Publication is expected in the coming months, following the launch of the Government's Economic Recovery Plan. </p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It  is important to note that exits from CE and T&uacute;s schemes after this date will be organised in partnership with the scheme sponsors and on a coordinated, phased basis over a number of months.  This will support the ongoing delivery of important services in the community while facilitating the referral and recruitment of replacement long term unemployed candidates for the schemes.  It should be noted that referrals to CE and T&uacute;s have continued throughout the ongoing level 5 restrictions where it has been safe and appropriate to do so.  Referrals will start to increase once current Level 5 restrictions begin to ease to ensure opportunities are available for the new cohort of long term unemployed. </p>  <p>  Training is an important component of CE and some CE participant training has continued online throughout the Level-5 restrictions.  The latest contract extensions will provide many CE participants with additional time in which to complete their training. Where a CE participant finishes up on their scheme without completing the training outlined in their Individual Learning Plan and if unfortunately they remain unemployed, they may continue their development through a range of training supports provided by my Department such as the Training Support Grant and the Back to Education Allowance.  Department case officers will engage with former CE participants to discuss the available options. </p>  <p>  One of the measures introduced in the Government&rsquo;s July, 2020 Jobs Stimulus package was to increase the capacity of the Public Employment Services.  Additional resources have since been introduced and will be central to meeting the increased demand for services, including recruitment to existing employment support schemes once normal operations have resumed. </p>  <p>  It is therefore not proposed to further-extend all CE and T&uacute;s participant contracts by 12 months at this time.   However, contract extension dates will continue to be monitored in line with Government public health restrictions in place over the coming months. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of these programmes and will continue to support and improve the programmes for the benefit of the CE and T&uacute;s participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

In the case of Disability Allowance, the first &euro;50,000 of capital is disregarded. </p><p>The capital assessment formula is not designed to reflect interest or annuity rates available to investors and no account is taken of interest or dividend payments received in the means assessment.</p><p>Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  I do appreciate the difficulties arising in cases of the type raised by the Deputy, and I have asked my officials to consider the potential for addressing the issue in the context of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

(The increases to the earnings disregards for both the disability allowance and the blind pension in Budget 2021 may make this a better option for some customers.  These increases are to commence from June of this year);</p><p>- an improved approach to communications relating to the scheme.</p><p>While work is ongoing to further improve the operation of the scheme, there has been an increase in the numbers of persons availing of the payment.  There was a 19.6% increase from March 2019 to March 2020 and a smaller increase of 5.2% (during the period of the pandemic) from March 2020 to March 2021.  Some 3,172 persons are now availing of the scheme.  </p></reply>

This is because many employers operate a "last in-first out" protocol when reducing their labour force. Moreover, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact on our youth is driven by the tendency for many younger people to work in some of the sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic; namely accommodation and food and retail.</p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, seasonally adjusted youth unemployment (15-24 year olds) stood at just over 11% in December 2019. Latest estimates from the CSO however, show that by the end of March 2021, this figure had increased to almost 15%. These estimates exclude those in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Including all those in receipt of the PUP gives a COVID-19 adjusted unemployment rate estimate is 59.2 % for young people at the end of March.</p>  <p>  It is important to note a significant number of PUP recipients are students. As of end-March 2021, it is estimated that 47,000 PUP recipients are students, with almost 90 percent of these in the under 25 cohort. Using international measures of unemployment, set by the International Labour Organisation, students are generally not counted as unemployed, as they are not considered part of the labour force. Therefore, the inclusion of recipients of PUP, including students, in the COVID-19 Adjusted Measure of youth unemployment  artificially inflates this measure.</p>  <p>  We know that  jobs of many persons currently on PUP will not be permanently lost due to the pandemic. Many will return to previous employment once restrictions ease, as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020. However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs. </p>  <p>  This is why the European Council believed it was important to reinforce the existing Youth Guarantee to aid in alleviating the labour market impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on young people. This aim is complementary to our objectives in Government.  As Minister for Social Protection, I welcomed the Council of the European Union&rsquo;s recommendation of a reinforced Youth Guarantee.</p>  <p>  Central to the reinforced programme is the extension of the widening of the youth age bracket to include young people aged 25-29. As part of activation services provided by my Department via Intreo, young people under 25 receive the most intensive engagement. My Department intend to extend this up to age 29, as per the new reinforced Youth Guarantee, and are currently exploring the necessary system changes to allow for this to be put in place.</p>  <p>  Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures to support persons including young persons back to employment:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres, with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports.</p>  <p>  - Increasing the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people, by expanding the young person rate from under 25 to under 30 years of age. Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).</p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic and in receipt of PUP, by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months.</p>  <p>  A core element of the reinforced Youth Guarantee is to support young people in gaining valuable work experience and developing the right skills for a changing world of work. My Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new Work Placement Experience Programme for those out of work for at least six months, regardless of age. This programme will seek to encourage businesses provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;. I expect to launch the Programme as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, the reinforced Youth Guarantee notes the value in supporting apprenticeships as a means of training young people and providing stable labour market integration. Last week, my colleague, Minister Harris, launched the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025. The Action Plan sets out a five-year strategy to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment of reaching 10,000 new apprentice registrations per year by 2025. The plan provides a roadmap to a single apprenticeship system and new supports for employers and apprentices, which will prove attractive for many young people.</p>  <p>  These efforts will be further bolstered by Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which is currently being finalised by my Department. Pathways to Work, is the Government&rsquo;s national employment services strategy. It will set out how an expanded Public Employment Service will utilise its existing and expanded capacity to deliver effective services in a post-COVID labour market. Publication is expected in the coming months, following the launch of the Government's Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is around 55% of the working population (CSO, Pension Coverage Survey 2020) and it is estimated that this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation. Many of these people will become reliant on the State pension for all or most of their income in retirement and accordingly, may face a significant unwanted drop in income.</p><p>Although the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 to 2023 provided for the development and implementation of an Automatic Enrolment (AE) retirement savings system by 2022, this Government recognises the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency. Therefore, the Government will seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles:</p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers.</p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions.</p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.</p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.</p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection continues to work on the design of the AE system. There are five main areas where work is ongoing so as to produce design options. These areas relate to:</p><p>- the scope and role of a Central Processing Authority for the system;</p><p>- the nature and functions of Registered Providers of savings products;</p><p>- the investment framework and funds to be offered by Registered Providers, including the design of the default fund and the pay-out phase;</p><p>- the design of the State financial incentive; and</p><p>- the phasing of implementation.</p><p>In progressing this work, the Department is receiving technical support from the European Commission&rsquo;s DG Reform which assists EU member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

The specific lots will be detailed in the request for tender, which will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  The forthcoming RFT will place due emphasis on the quality of services to be provided, while expanding the capacity of the Public Employment Service (PES). Tenders will be assessed based primarily on the quality of their respective proposals. This initial competitive procurement process, required to comply with EU procurement rules, will have no impact on the contracts of existing providers in other areas and it is expected that local community and voluntary organisations will be in a strong position to respond to the RFT. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issues raised, in practice the annual "cost met" funding approach requires a level of scrutiny of day-to-day expenditure, which places an undue administrative burden on both the employment service provider and my Department. Such an approach diverts valuable resources away from supporting clients and as such does nothing to enhance employment outcomes for the long-term unemployed. Moving to a multiannual funding approach, which pays for each jobseeker referred to the service, with a guarantee on the minimum number of referrals and with a strong emphasis on quality of service provision, is more likely to deliver enhanced outcomes for those availing of the service. </p>  <p>  Separately, the current contracts for all contracted PES provision expire at the end of 2021. My Department, in light of the significant challenge facing the Public Employment Service, is therefore preparing to procure, in a manner that is compatible with procurement law,  sufficient high-quality capacity to meet expected demand for employment services. </p>  <p>  Organisations with strong experience in the delivery of similar services at a community and local level will be in a strong position to respond to the RFTs when they issue.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, it is also the case that there is no accommodation space available in their preferred location at this time.  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is significant demand for any available spaces within the greater Dublin region but such spaces are limited because of the cost of such accommodation and because contractors have not offered accommodation to IPAS for use for accommodating applicants for International Protection.</p></reply>

Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. </p>  <p>  All centres are following the guidelines that were published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). These are publicly available at its website www.hpsc.ie.

My Department is working closely with the HSE and public health authorities in ensuring that guidance and measures in place at all centres are sufficient in light of changing conditions.</p>  <p>  Centre managers have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres for the use of residents and staff as required. Other PPE such as masks, gloves, visors and aprons are distributed as needed and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings.</p>  <p>  In addition an IPAS Living with COVID Plan was developed and clearly explains how each of the five levels of restrictions in Resilience and  Recovery 2020-2021 affects residents and visitors to centres.</p>  <p>  All centres have put arrangements in place to support social and physical distancing when using laundry rooms, communal kitchens, dining rooms, foodhalls and other communal areas.  Such arrangements may include limits on the number of people using the facilities at one time, rota systems and food collection for dining in own rooms.  Residents are advised of the specific measures in each centre and appropriate signage is put in place too.</p></reply>

Since the launch of the Inclusion Strategy, a Committee has been in place to oversee its implementation. This group is made up of officials from key Government departments as well as civil society groups that represent LGBTI+ people in Ireland. The Committee has met on four occasions to date, most recently in March 2021. The Committee will meet next in June 2021.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to end the practice of conversion therapy, a commitment I strongly support. The LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy 2018 &ndash; 2020 contains a commitment to prohibit the promotion or practice of conversion therapy by health professionals in Ireland. The National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 commits to ensuring that the practice of conversion therapy in Ireland is investigated and followed up with appropriate counter measures.</p>  <p>  My Department has prepared an initial scoping paper on this issue.  A research subgroup of the Inclusion Strategy is being established and will consider what further research might be required in this area before legislative proposal can be brought forward by the Department of Health. I will engage on these proposals in the first instance with the LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy Committee. </p></reply>

It is important that all standards are kept under review and that they remain fit for purpose. It is also vital that key stakeholders, like foster carers, have confidence in standards while they are in use. My Department values the contribution of foster carers highly, and their views on the proposed draft standards have been noted. </p>  <p>  Following completion of the drafting process HIQA will present the Draft National Standards for Children&rsquo;s Social Services for consideration and approval by the Minister for Health in consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Where an application includes children of an applicant, IPAS also assess their vulnerability in an appropriate manner.</p>  <p>  The Vulnerability Assessment begins with an initial interview after the applicant first applies for international protection. If this initial assessment indicates that the applicant has one or more vulnerabilities within the meaning of the law governing Vulnerability Assessments, one or more further assessments may be carried out while the applicant is living in the IPAS Reception Centre, or subsequently when they have moved to longer term accommodation. Taken together, these assessments are used to determine whether the applicant has special reception needs arising from any vulnerabilities identified. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the interview stays focused and on its purpose the assessor will be provided with a standard list of assessment questions. These questions are based on the various categories of vulnerability identified within the EU Reception Conditions Directive 2013/33/EU, and have been refined within the Irish context with the help of the HSE. The assessment will be carried out in a sensitive, conversational manner with gender-appropriate officers and interpretation as required.   </p>  <p>  The IPAS officer who conducted the interview uses the information provided to make a determination of the applicant&rsquo;s vulnerability status.  The person will be provided with a written document to this effect. Where the Vulnerability Assessment does not identify an applicant as vulnerable within the meaning of the regulations, they will be provided with a document to this effect. </p>  <p>  However, as vulnerabilities can manifest themselves at any stage of the protection process, applicants will be able to undergo a further Vulnerability Assessment at a later stage if this is desired by the applicant and deemed necessary by IPAS or other reception service providers. This is to help ensure that any vulnerabilities that may subsequently arise are identified in a timely manner. </p>  <p>  If the vulnerability assessment identifies one or more vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:</p>  <p>  - Consider whether the vulnerability identified has implications for the accommodation to be provided to the applicant at the Reception Centre and advise those responsible for assigning accommodation accordingly.   </p>  <p>  - Consider whether the vulnerability identified has implications for the accommodation to be provided to the applicant after they move from the Reception Centre and advise the IPAS dispersal team accordingly. The dispersal team then take the outcome of the Vulnerability Assessment into account when determining where to accommodate the applicant. How this is done is described below at section 12 of this policy.</p>  <p>  - Consider whether a further assessment is required and, if we deem that it is, make arrangements for a further assessment to be carried out. Where a follow-up assessment is indicated, the applicant will receive an appointment for this to be carried out at a later date.</p>  <p>  - Advise the Health Service Executive (HSE) Care Team in the Reception Centre that the applicant&rsquo;s Vulnerability Assessment has identified one or more vulnerabilities. We do this only so that the HSE Care Team can engage proactively with the applicant to encourage them to avail of the optional health screening offered in the Reception Centre. We do not disclose the nature of the vulnerabilities identified.</p>  <p>  As of 21 April 2021, 306 applicants have entered the vulnerability assessment process with 165 assessments complete and 129 ongoing.  So far, 97 applicants have been identified as having some form of vulnerability as defined in the EU Reception Conditions Directive (Recast). It should be noted that not every vulnerability requires special intervention.  For example, every child or pregnant woman is identified by default as vulnerable under the Directive whose reception needs are routinely identified during their orientation period at the National Reception Centre in Balseskin.  This would account for approximately one third of all applicants detected as vulnerable to date.  </p>  <p>  It is intended that the questions used will be kept under review during the pilot phase and refined to ensure the process continues to elicit the best possible information to assist in the assessment.</p></reply>

It is important that all standards are kept under review, to ensure that they remain fit for purpose.

Earlier this month, I launched a new National Framework for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-Making to support government departments, agencies and organisations to improve their participation practice with children and young people. I was delighted to see that the launch event was attended by representative of national, regional and local organisations including, for example, a number of government departments, Local Authorities, health services, and youth organisation. </p>  <p>  I have also announced a Capacity Building Grant to support implementation of the Framework. </p>  <p>  The production of a renewed youth strategy is a strategic action of my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2023. Covid has resulted in our finite resources having to be prioritised for pressing needs and some previously planned pieces of work have had to be delayed. The current National Youth Strategy, which was due to be replaced in recent months, continues to provide an overarching framework for the development of cross-government and cross-sectoral policy and service provision relating to young people aged 10 to 24. Its aim is to enable all young people to realise their maximum potential, by respecting their rights and hearing their voices, while protecting and supporting them as they transition from childhood to adulthood. </p></reply>

Services operating any of the aforementioned programmes would also be eligible to apply for Programme Support Payments.  My Department also has a number of strands of sustainability funding which are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal. However, it is not readily feasible at present, to disaggregate the total amounts of funding provided to those childcare providers that are provided by FRCs. </p>  <p>  It may also be possible for FRCs to access youth funding programmes, from my Department's Youth Affairs Unit.

Also, Student grant legislation was amended in 2020 to retain the status quo, thus allowing funding for eligible students attending an approved undergraduate course in the UK to continue post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  In general, an approved undergraduate course in this context is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU Member State or the UK.  </p>  <p>  The student grant scheme does not and never has extended to the payment of tuition fees to institutions outside the State, other than for exceptional provision in respect of postgraduate courses in Northern Ireland. This provision is consistent with the principles of the Good Friday agreement and is intended to promote greater tolerance and understanding between both jurisdictions.  The Scheme also does not extend to PLC courses pursued outside of the State or postgraduate study pursued outside of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The extension of funding in this way would represent a major policy change which has the potential to impose very significant additional costs for the Exchequer.  Any such decision could only be considered in light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector. Accordingly, at present I do not intend to depart from the current arrangements.</p>  <p>  In terms of tuition fees in Ireland, the fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. </p>  <p>  The State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies.  This support has played a very significant role in facilitating access to and growth in higher education. What was previously the preserve of a relatively small proportion of the school leaving population is now much more widely available, as reflected in the current transfer rate from second to third level. </p>  <p>  This commitment is demonstrated through the Free Fees Schemes under which the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students attending approves courses in the State with students paying the student contribution. The student contribution applies to all students on an annual basis, who are eligible under for the free fees scheme. The current rate is &euro;3,000 per annum. Currently 60,000 students have all or part of the student contribution paid on their behalf by the State via the Student Grant Scheme.</p>  <p>  Funding under the Free Fees Initiative is only available in respect of approved courses within the State.</p>  <p>  The development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential in light of the centrality of higher education to our progress as a country. In that context, a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is underway supported under the European Commission DG Reform Programme.   My Department is working closely with the European Commission and the independently appointed consortia of consultants.  The key aim of this review is to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, including an examination of the funding options. This review commenced in early 2020 and work is expected to be complete towards the latter part of Q2 2021. </p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie </p></reply>

The overall aim of the PLC Pathways to Apprenticeship Programme is to provide opportunities for learners to gain experience in areas where they are considering undertaking an apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  Funding is available within the overall funding allocated to PLC provision. Initial planning data indicates that 813 learners will benefit from this funding in 2021. However, like all FET provision, final numbers taking up places may be affected by Covid restrictions. A pre-apprenticeship initiative is also underway via Technological University Dublin, with their Access to Apprenticeship programme now in its third year. The TU Dublin programme aims to support individuals who have experienced particularly severe social and/or economic barriers to access the apprenticeship route. </p>  <p>  SOLAS is also running a second year of a Generation Apprenticeship competition at second level, which is open to those at school, in Youthreach and in Community Training Centres. The competition aims to introduce young people, their families, teachers and guidance counsellors to all of the opportunities available within apprenticeship in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Programme for Government, a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship to cover the period 2021-2025 was launched on 19th April.  The Plan promotes access, diversity and inclusion in apprenticeship by offering targeted supports to encourage participation from young people and under-represented groups such as women, those with disabilities and those from ethnic minority backgrounds.  Relevant actions include publishing information on access to apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship courses on www.apprenticeship.ie and labelling these courses clearly with progression routes into apprenticeship clearly identified.</p></reply>

I am aware of the important contribution made by this sector and of the challenges that are being encountered given the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers.</p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector in March 2020 which has met 11 times to date. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and sectoral representatives of staff, students and providers.  Further to the meetings of the Working Group, there has been a substantial level of engagement between my Department and representatives from the ELE sector over this period both bilaterally and in other forums.  </p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for English language education providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector. In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. Following the conclusion of the TWSS last August, it was superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which continues to provide payroll support to businesses. In addition to the subsidy that is being provided via the EWSS, this scheme also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI. </p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices. A full list of these supports and related information is available for providers here: . </p><p>My Department has received the most recent proposals for supports from the sector and is continuing to engage with ELE provider representatives in this regard as this sector prepares to move towards re-opening, in line with public health guidelines, and continues on a path to recovery.</p></reply>

The courses, which are at Level 6 (Higher Certificate) to Level 9 (Master's Degree) on the National Framework of Qualifications, are being delivered in public and private higher education providers around the country.

It provides grant assistance to eligible students attending approved full-time courses in approved further or higher educational institutions who meet the prescribed eligibility criteria of the relevant scheme. The Scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the national student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland), a business unit of CDETB.  Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>In the academic year 2020/21 a total of 100,924 applications were received by SUSI, 79,232 of which were awarded grant support, 18, 589 were refused and 3,103 were cancelled. I have attached the data requested by the Deputy for previous years. </p><p>A student may be refused grant support by SUSI for a variety of reasons including:</p><p>-  The student did not meet the eligibility criteria as outlined in the Student Support Act 2011 and Student Support Scheme 2020;</p><p>-  The student was found to exceed the reckonable income limits outlined in the Student Support Scheme 2020;</p><p>-  The student was repeating a year and so was not progressing in their education;</p><p>-  The student was in receipt of Back to Education Allowance and so is not eligible for a maintenance grant;</p><p>-  The student is attending a course which is not approved under the Student Support Scheme 2020.</p><p>Please note, SUSI opened to receive renewal applications for 2021/2022 on 31/3/2021, and for new applications on 22/4/21.</p><p>25,511 applications had been received up to 22/4/21. As the vast majority of these applications as still in the assessment process, it is not possible to provide final status figures for 2021/2022 at this stage of the SUSI processing calendar.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the Programme for Government commitment to among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. My Department is currently overseeing the implementation of the review through a Steering Committee with student representation as well as representation from SUSI. In excess of 250 submissions have been received from individuals and organisations via a public consultation process. The final report will be available in Autumn and will inform future considerations regarding the development of student grant policy. <table>    <tr>       <th>Status Award/Ref/Can</th>       <th>2015-16</th>       <th>2016-17</th>       <th>2017-18</th>       <th>2018-19</th>       <th>2019-20</th>       <th>2020-21</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Awarded</td>       <td>84,012</td>       <td>84,111</td>       <td>82,077</td>       <td>79,797</td>       <td>76,347</td>       <td>79,232</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Refused</td>       <td>18,594</td>       <td>17,639</td>       <td>17,130</td>       <td>15,878</td>       <td>16,748</td>       <td>18,589</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cancelled</td>       <td>5,599</td>       <td>3,558</td>       <td>4,166</td>       <td>3,121</td>       <td>2,999</td>       <td>3,103</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>108,205</td>       <td>105,308</td>       <td>103,373</td>       <td>98,796</td>       <td>96,094</td>       <td>100,924</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

On 21 December 2020, I appointed an advisory panel to assess the application and to furnish a report thereon to the HEA. The advisory panel&rsquo;s report was furnished to the HEA on 12 February 2021. I subsequently received this report along with the views of the HEA on 1 April 2021.</p>  <p>  Under section 34(1) of the 2018 Act, I am required within 60 days of receiving and considering the advisory panel report, HEA views and information provided, to notify the applicant institutes of my proposed decision on their joint application. I am currently considering all relevant material in the context of my role as decision maker under the 2018 Act and within the requisite legislatively prescribed timeframe.</p>  <p>  The creation of new TUs is a key commitment within the Programme for Government and is viewed as a prerequisite for balanced regional development, the retention and attraction of a highly skilled workforce, research capacity building, access to higher education provision and broad socioeconomic progression.</p>  <p>  A new multi-campus TU can become a catalyst for enterprise and regional development and increase the academic and regional profile of the unified, integrated higher education institution (HEI) nationally and internationally. The potential benefits of becoming a successful TU are significant in terms of increased higher education access and excellence in teaching and learning, greater critical mass and reach facilitating international recognition, research capacity building, Foreign Direct Investment attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and broader socioeconomic progression. These benefits should accrue to all campuses across any new multi-campus TU and across the wider hinterland of the university to positively benefit all counties and communities within a region.</p>  <p>  Anchored in a multi-campus physical environment, TUs can also provide state-of-the-art learning resources such as libraries, laboratories and e-learning facilities, utilising their solid campus base to support the provision of online and distance learning and widening access to a suite of research informed teaching and learning excellence across all levels of the National Framework of Qualification. As such, TUs can meet the higher education needs of the widest possible range of learners and are legislatively required to have particular regard to the needs of their regions and to provide programmes of education and training that reflects the needs of individuals, business, enterprise, the professions, the community, local interests and other stakeholders in their region. </p>  <p>  Government has to date invested heavily in the TU agenda to date with over &euro;65 million invested through higher education landscape and transformation funding since 2013.  The TU Transformation fund will expend &euro;90 million in total to 2023 with &euro;34.3 million having been allocated in its first tranche last October. In total, over &euro;120 million will have been invested in TU development and progression by 2023.</p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the 2019 Technological University Research Network (TURN) report which sets out the blueprint and requirements for successful TUs in the State, is the prioritisation of capital investment in TUs where they are exclusively dependent on Exchequer resourcing.  Capital investment has been and will continue to be associated with ongoing TU progression. Currently eleven building projects in the technological sector are being advanced as part of the Higher Education Public Private Partnership (PPP) Programme. These projects will play an important role in enabling projected increases in student enrolments, addressing constraints with regard to existing infrastructure and significantly advancing the TU agenda. The configuration and utilisation of specific campuses in any TU are matters for the individual TU upon establishment. </p>  <p>  I am strongly committed to capital investment capital investment to underpin the ambitions of our higher education institutions including TUs. Officials from the Department and the Higher Education Authority have regular engagement with HEIs, including Limerick IT and Athlone IT, in relation to their future campus development plans.</p></reply>

The steering group is comprised of representatives from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science,  our agencies, Higher Education Institutions, Students, Adult Education, HEAnet and ICTU. The steering group meets fortnightly and additional meetings can be convened at short notice as necessary.</p><p>The work of the steering group is supported by the establishment of working groups to address particular issues and the membership of these working groups may be comprised of representatives from other organisations as appropriate. </p><p>The following principles underpin the work in the Structure:</p><p>-  Prioritising the immediate needs of the health system;</p><p>-  Prioritising learners&rsquo; interests;</p><p>-  The importance of maintaining continuity in educational services;</p><p>-  Ensuring the integrity and quality of solutions;</p><p>-  Ensuring that, at a minimum, disadvantage is not exacerbated by the crisis and actions taken in response to it; and</p><p>-  Sharing best practice, solutions and leveraging unity.</p><p>It should be noted that more recently stakeholder groups have also been established in the further education sector and the technological education sector. These stakeholder groups support the continuity of education in these sectors and address at a more granular level the planning, co-ordination and provision of education in the institutions in these sectors.</p><p>A working group to plan for the return to tertiary education in the academic year 2021/22 is currently being established. Comprised of key stakeholders, this group will work over the coming weeks to develop a plan for returning to onsite tertiary education in the autumn.  The working group will work closely with the relevant stakeholder groups and other working groups and will report back to the steering group in May.</p><p>The purpose of the Plan will be to:</p><p>-  Enable maximum onsite provision of teaching, learning, research and other onsite activities</p><p>-  Retain scope for online teaching where necessary</p><p>-  Support the ongoing needs of students and learners</p><p>-  Ensure coherence and consistency in planning across the sector</p><p>-  Support autonomy in the work of institutions and providers in the development of their plans.</p><p>The plan will build on the plan which was developed for the academic year 2020/21 incorporating the experience of 2020/21 and it will retain the approach of a discretionary framework for institutions to prioritise onsite attendance and enabling phased increases leading to greater levels of onsite provision.</p><p>The new plan will continue to prioritise public health and safety and respond to ongoing changes in public health, including the level of vaccination achieved and national public health advice.</p><p>Institutions are currently using their own discretion to prioritise on-site attendance for time critical practical learning and to ensure that this is no more than 5% of the student cohort at any one time.  As attendance onsite is for time critical purposes, this can change from time to time depending on the subject area and student cohort and this is decided at the discretion of individual institutions.  Accordingly, information is not available regarding the number of students being taught online versus those allowed to attend on-campus practical classes by institution in tabular form.</p><p>There is ongoing engagement with the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) at a national level through bilateral meetings and their membership of the steering group.  USI recently chaired a Student Welfare and Engagement working group which has reported to the steering group on the supports that will be required for students and learners. There is also ongoing engagement at a local level by HEIs with student unions.</p></reply>

All apprentices including those undertaking the new consortia led apprenticeships are excluded from the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  All other general employment legislation applies to apprenticeship as contracts of employment.</p>  <p>  In the case of the 35 apprenticeships established since 2016, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer.  Neither the Department or any other State agency collect data in relation to apprenticeships wages. </p>  <p>  In relation to the quality of the apprenticeship experience, the core regulatory standards for apprenticeship provided for in the 1967 Act have been enhanced through statutory rules and administrative guidance. </p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Code of Practice which specifies the rights and responsibilities of apprentices and employers and is signed by both parties, forms the basis of each apprenticeship contract.  In tandem with adherence to core regulatory standards, apprenticeships are underpinned by a strong framework of quality assurance to ensure programmes provide a high quality learning experience for apprentices. </p>  <p>  Authorised Officers (AOs) provide a critical role in ensuring a high quality on-the-job experience in apprenticeship. AOs approve employers before they can register apprentices, progress the registration of apprentices and provide a point of contact for apprentices in addition to general monitoring of compliance with the Code of Practice. </p>  <p>  A review of the application of the quality assurance framework to the craft apprenticeships was completed in December 2020. Building on this, and experience to date, a comprehensive review of the quality assurance, governance arrangements and processes for the existing consortia-led programmes will be undertaken and utilised to inform the development of a robust and future proofed quality assurance system for the future.</p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 apprentices will be supported to complete their programmes through clearer communication, support networks and increased ownership of their learning journey. The voice of apprentices in shaping the future of the system will be formalised within the single system of apprenticeship, enhancing the existing apprentice feedback mechanism which is inherent in the QQI quality processes. Apprentices will be included both looking to the future through representation on the apprenticeship stakeholder oversight and advisory structures and also through an annual survey of apprentices which will provide a robust system view for the prior year. </p></reply>

So while the surplus has built up over previous years due to improvements seen in the economic and labour market situation before Covid-19 started to impacted in 2020, it was not possible to increase expenditure beyond that generated by the increase in the levy. </p><p>There has been very substantial growth in NTF spending in recent years on the basis of the +0.1% increase in the Training Levy in both 2018 and 2019 with expenditure increasing by &euro;58m (16%) and &euro;69m (17%) respectively.  This has supported a very significant expansion in NTF priorities.  The Training Levy increased in Budget 2020 to 1% allowing a further increase in NTF spending of &euro;77m.</p><p>The NTF Advisory Group continues to be the mechanism to inform and guide on investment from the Fund and the use of the surplus.

These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such common areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to annual service charges, it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis. Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC. </p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments. It provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an Order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act. The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation. The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p>  <p>  This Act does not specify interest rates in relation to service charges. However, I would refer the Deputy to the Late Payments in Commercial Transactions Regulation, which comes under the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for further information on this matter.</p></reply>

It is something I am very grateful for because it is so important to our understanding of where there are gaps in the system and reforms that need to be advanced. It also shows victims of similar abuse that they are not alone and hopefully encourages others to reach out for support and to report the abuse. </p>  <p>  From the information I have on the campaign mentioned by the Deputy, the aims of it, in particular its focus on education and training, on awareness raising and on promoting responsible online behaviour, are to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, 'Coco's Law', which has been enacted as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, entered into force on 10 February 2021.</p>  <p>  Coco&rsquo;s Law gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the tools they need to make sure that those who commit abusive crimes both online and offline can be prosecuted and, if prosecuted and found guilty, our courts now have sentences available to them that reflect the level of harm these crimes cause to their victims. I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that training on The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act will be covered on level 3 witness training as of the 10th May 2021 in the lesson entitled &lsquo;Victims of Sex Crime&rsquo; (delivered by Garda National Protective Services Bureau).</p>  <p>  My Department is currently running the No Excuses campaign which aims to increase awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence in Irish society. Our plan is to incorporate information on Coco&rsquo;s Law into this campaign in the coming months. This will include a focus on ensuring there is public awareness of the fact that the sharing of intimate images is a form of sexual abuse and one which now carries a significant penalty.</p>  <p>  We intend to communicate our message in a way that will build on our existing No Excuses campaign and its key message of not excusing sexual harassment or sexual violence.</p>  <p>  This is an important time to increase awareness and educate people about the consequences both legal and psychological of sharing images without consent. </p>  <p>  'Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo;, which will be implemented as a priority, places a strong emphasis on the need for victims to be treated with dignity and respect at every stage throughout the process and includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey through the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. </p>  <p>  To deliver on this objective, a sub-group has been tasked with identifying gaps in the current provision and recommending measures to address same, ascertaining the types of training that is needed, and designing a framework for its delivery. In the coming weeks, we will be advertising for expressions of interest from consultants who can work with us to analyse existing training provision and identify where the gaps are: this is the first step in putting additional training provisions in place to meet unmet needs.</p></reply>

It sets a valuable precedent for the translation of all application forms for Irish citizenship, which my Department, in written communications with the Office of the Language Commissioner, has committed to providing by the end of September. </p><p>The Form 8 application for citizenship (adult application) is by far the most frequently used form and was therefore prioritised for translation. However, work on the translation of the other citizenship application forms has already commenced. </p><p>My Department has the necessary resources in place to ensure that people wishing to make citizenship applications through Irish can do so. There are currently two officials in the Citizenship Division who are competent to carry out their business through Irish.</p><p>More broadly, my Department facilitates anyone wishing to engage with its services through the Irish language. There are 30 members of staff across the Department who are available to provide services and answer queries in Irish. 23 courses were run in the offices of my Department in Dublin and Killarney from 2006, the commencement year of the Department&rsquo;s Irish Scheme. Those courses were tailored specifically for the officials of my Department, and related to both written and oral Irish.</p><p>In addition, my Department has supported &ndash; and continues to support &ndash; members of staff who wish to attend Irish courses outside of the Department and to do online Irish courses. Last year, 15 officials participated, at various levels, in the Certificate in Professional Irish course provided by Gaelchult&uacute;r. Through their attendance at those courses, the ability and confidence of those officials to serve the public through Irish, as regards spoken and written Irish, has increased.</p><p>As stated in our Irish Language Scheme, despite its broad range of functional areas, my Department generally does not provide services directly to the public except in a number of specific areas. </p><p>Since early 2003, my Department has employed an Irish translator principally to oversee and carry out translations of the Rules of Court. Since then, my Department has published the official Irish version of the 1986, 1997 and 2001 consolidations of the Rules of the Superior Courts, the District Court Rules and the Circuit Court Rules, and many of the Amendments subsequently made to them, including the Rules of the Superior Courts (Court of Appeal Act 2014) 2014. All are available on our website at:  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Irish_Rules_of_Court).</p><p>Irish versions of the relevant forms for Criminal Injuries Compensation; Firearms and Ammunition; Explosives/Pyrotechnics; Bookmaker Licences; and Subject Access Requests are also available at www.justice.ie/ga/JELR/Pages/WP15000296).</p><p>It continues to be my Department&rsquo;s policy, in so far as possible, to provide an Irish version of any form or document specifically requested and we have a legal obligation under our Irish Language Scheme to reply in Irish to correspondence received in Irish.  </p><p>All of the application forms produced by the following bodies under the remit of my Department are also available bilingually:</p><p>-  The Property Registration Authority;</p><p>-  The Private Security Authority; and</p><p>-  The Irish Film Classification Office.</p></reply>

While every effort is made to process these applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume of appeals received, their complexity, the possible need for the visa office to seek further information in relation to certain appeals and the resources available to process them.</p>  <p>  Full consideration will be given to any appeals received on behalf of the applicants. However the onus is on applicants to satisfy the Visa Officer that visas should be granted. Processing times and decisions can be checked at the webpage for the relevant office. </p>  <p>  All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary. Guidelines in this regard are posted on the Immigration Service website. When making an appeal, the applicant should take into account the reasons for refusal listed in the refusal letter. The appeal should include any further information or additional documentation they wish to have considered, and should be sent for the attention of the Visa Appeals Officer, in the relevant Visa Office, where the matter will be considered afresh. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility (inisoireachtasmail@justice.ie), which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

However, the gambling regulator may also play a part in this regard.</p>  <p>  In March 2019, the Government published the Inter-Departmental Working Group Report on Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling. This report refers to the social impact of gambling, including the issue of problem gambling. </p>  <p>  The new gambling legislation will provide for the establishment of a social fund, financed through the regulator and by the industry, in the form of levies on licenced operators.

The Act was amended by Section 54 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which gave the Board the additional responsibility to provide a family mediation service.</p><p>Section 3(3) of the Act provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions. </p><p>However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board, and I am informed that, civil legal aid and advice is provided primarily through a network of law centres by solicitors employed by the Board.  There are 30 full time and 12 part time law centres. </p><p>Family mediation services are provided through 8 full time offices and 9 part time offices. The Legal Aid Board has established a number of co-located centres in Portlaoise, Kilkenny, Jervis House in Dublin, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Limerick and Tallaght.  These centres operate a full time law centre and either a full or part time mediation centre.  Court-based family mediation services are available in a number of courts around the country including Dolphin House in Dublin, Ennis, Carlow and Mullingar. </p><p>The waiting times for family mediation services as of 26 April 2021, are set out in the table below provided by the Board. I am informed that there is no waiting list for Ennis or Dolphin House, both of which provide a walk-in service. Information on the number of applicants awaiting an appointment and the length of time they are waiting in weeks is maintained by the Legal Aid Board on an office by office basis rather than by county. The Board advises that the number waiting may include some applicants who have already been offered appointments and have not been able to accept them for one reason or another. I am further advised that the current average waiting time for a mediation appointment across the country is 17 weeks. </p><p>The Board operates a co-located law and mediation centre in Letterkenny, Co. Donegal. As can be seen from the table below, the number of people awaiting a mediation appointment in this centre, as of 26 April 2021, stands at 13 and the longest time for a person awaiting a mediation appointment is 12 weeks.  </p><p>The Board offers short notice appointments to applicants that can accept a cancellation. Applicants with a pending Court date are offered priority appointments where possible.  Currently under Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, the Board offers online and telephone appointments.  Many applicants have availed of mediation sessions through these mediums.

If any further documentation is required, it will be requested from the person in due course.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

While every effort is made to process these applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume of appeals received, their complexity, the possible need for the visa office to seek further information in relation to certain appeals and the resources available to process them.</p>  <p>  All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary.  Guidelines in this regard are posted on the Immigration Service website. When making an appeal, the applicant should take into account the reasons for refusal listed in the refusal letter.  The appeal should include any further information or additional documentation they wish to have considered, and should be sent for the attention of the Visa Appeals Officer, in the relevant Visa Office, where the matter will be considered afresh. </p>  <p>  Full consideration will be given to any appeals received.  However, as I have said, the onus is on applicants to satisfy the Visa Officer that visas should be granted.

Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted. The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.</p>  <p>  The judgement in the 2015 Supreme Court case of H v. H [2015] IESC 7 has confirmed that Irish law does not recognise the validity of a divorce lawfully granted prior to 2 October 1986 in a country where neither party to the marriage was domiciled at the date of institution of the divorce proceedings but where one party was resident on that date. </p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State. </p>  <p>  The Thirty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019. </p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,</p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The amendment will allow a change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces. The current law on recognition of foreign divorces has remained as it was before the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution because the Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining the recognition of foreign divorces. </p>  <p>  When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation on the recognition of foreign divorces.</p></reply>

The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term "subject to contract". </p>  <p>  The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 "Report on Gazumping" (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, for example, to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to introduce or amend legislation in this area. However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Property Services Regulatory Authority, which was established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland" which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts. The Guide is available on the Authority's website at: www.psr.ie. </p></reply>

Staff in the IPO have worked both onsite and remotely throughout the pandemic to ensure the protection process continues to operate.</p>  <p>  In general, the scheduling of interviews by the IPO is done in accordance with the prioritisation policy agreed with the UNHCR and published on the IPO website www.ipo.gov.ie. This prioritisation, provided for under section 73 of the International Protection Act 2015, is subject to the need for fairness and efficiency in dealing with applications for international protection.  Scheduling of cases will primarily be done on the basis of the date of application (oldest cases first).</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 public health measures required to ensure the safety of applicants, legal representatives and staff have resulted in additional logistical challenges that can slow down the scheduling process. The IPO continues to explore new ways of working but it must operate within legal and logistical constraints, with the health and safety of all involved as an absolute priority. In-person contact and support, which remains an indispensable part of the process also presents the greatest challenges during Covid-19. The IPO continues to work to ensure that those who had their interviews postponed are rescheduled as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Substantive protection interviews under section 35 of the 2015 Act were first suspended in line with public health requirements on 13 March 2020.  They resumed, in lower numbers than before due to public health measures, on 20 July and continued until 21 October when they were again suspended in line with public health measures. Interviews resumed for the period 2 December until 18 December 2020, at which point they were once again suspended.  There have been no interviews to date in 2021.</p>  <p>  The IPO continues to maintain an interview schedule, to enable as rapid a resumption as possible once public health measures allow this to happen.  Currently there are in the region of 500 applicants on that draft schedule.  There will, inevitably, be a period between the date that the IPO is informed that interviews can resume and the first interviews taking place in the interests of fairness to allow applicants and their legal representatives to prepare for the interview.</p>  <p>  According to IPO records, just under 2,700 section 35 interviews were scheduled during 2020 of which just over 1,100 proceeded.  Just over 1,000 interviews were postponed due to Covid-19.  This figure includes applicants who, unfortunately, had interviews postponed more than once as the situation evolved over the course of the year.  The comparable figure for 2019 is approximately 4,500 interviews scheduled of which 3,200 proceeded.</p>  <p>  The IPO successfully piloted interviews by video conference in 2019 and is now working to expand that programme with a view to making interviews by video conference a significant element of IPO operations. </p>  <p>  Efforts to improve processing times have been seriously impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced the output of decisions considerably and has impacted on the target set by the IPO to make first instance decisions in the vast majority of cases within 9 months. </p>  <p>  The median processing times for determinations made by the IPO in 2020 for all cases was 17.6 months and for prioritised cases was 12.7 months.  The median processing time for all cases processed to completion in the IPO in Q1 2021 was 22.2 months, and 16.1 months for prioritised cases. The median processing time for decisions made by the Ministerial Decisions Unit in 2020 was 1.6 months. The median processing time for cases completed in the Ministerial Decisions Unit in Q1 2021 was 0.2 months.</p>  <p>  While the International Protection Office makes a first instance recommendation, decisions in respect of international protection are made by the Ministerial Decisions Unit. </p>  <p>  At the end of March 2021, there were 5,130 cases pending at the IPO and 596 cases pending in the Ministerial Decisions Unit.</p>  <p>  In October 2020, I announced that an additional &euro;1.75m had been allocated for asylum processing in 2021 for the efficient functioning of the international protection system, which will help us to further improve processing times for applications.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to implementing the key recommendations in the Expert Advisory Group Report to reduce processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and Establish a New International Protection Support Service.</p>  <p>  Work is under way in my Department towards identifying mechanisms which will assist with working towards improved processing times, including an end-to-end review of processes to guide enhanced processing times.</p></reply>

By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. The epidemiological situation has substantially improved since the peak of the third wave of infection in December 2020/January 2021, with the 14 day incidence reducing from a peak of 1,534 cases per 100,000 to a current rate of 121 cases per 100,000 on the 25th April. This has led to a corresponding significant reduction in hospitalisations and mortality. In terms of mortality, to date, a total of 1,399 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported as having occurred during January 2021, 860 in February, 221 in March and 58 in April to date (25th April). In addition, the vaccination programme is well underway, with many of our most vulnerable citizens in the process of being protected through vaccination.</p>  <p>  While the current position gives us cause for hope, there is still, however, a significant level of disease nationally, and a need for continued caution. The Government announced a phased easing of some restrictions over April in recognition of the significant impact that the extended period of Level 5 restrictions is having on people. The focus of this easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities in order to improve the health and wellbeing of society. The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position again later this week and it is anticipated that a roadmap for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be agreed.</p></reply>

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.</p>  <p>  The HPSC published new visiting guidance on 23rd April, which comes into effect on 4th May, and will provide additional opportunities to visit nursing home residents. Residents may now be facilitated to receive four routine visits per week. This will be possible following two weeks after the full vaccination of approximately 8 out of 10 of all residents in the nursing home. Otherwise, two visits per week should be facilitated. The duration of visits should be appropriate to the needs of the resident and should not be less than one hour. Where there is high vaccine coverage, 2 people may visit at a time but there is no requirement to limit the number of nominated visitors.</p>  <p>  If a visitor is fully vaccinated and is visiting in a room with a resident who is fully vaccinated with no other person present, they do not need to wear masks or avoid physical contact.</p>  <p>  A copy of the latest guidance can be accessed through the link below: </p>  <p>  www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/infectionpreventionandcontrolguidance/residentialcarefacilities/Guidance%20on%20visits%20to%20RCF.pdf.</p>  <p>  Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with COVID-19 remains very real. There is still a risk of introduction of infection, including the possibility of a new variant of COVID-19, against which the vaccine may be less effective. Therefore, caution remains appropriate. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention and control measures must be maintained and public health advice must continue to be followed, including when visiting, to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.</p>  <p>  The guidance also re-states the existing position that there are very limited, if any, circumstances, including outbreaks, in which outdoor or window visiting should be suspended on infection prevention and control grounds.</p>  <p>  I have recently written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the HPSC guidance on visitation. I have also met with HIQA on this matter to stress the importance of implementation of the guidance. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the new guidance and public health advice. Providers are also encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Ireland has, through its participation in this process, gained access to a broad range of vaccines that it might not otherwise have access to, and at the cost agreed collectively by the EU.</p>  <p>  Recently, the Commission has engaged in negotiations with Pfizer / BioNTech with a view to securing a Purchase Agreement for 900m doses of its vaccine on behalf of Member States, with provision for an additional 900m doses, for 2022/2023. Pfizer / BioNTech's vaccine is based upon mRNA technology, providing scope for it to be adjusted to deal with variants of Covid-19. The vaccine could also be used to provide booster shots, where required. The appropriate mix of vaccine technologies to provide boosters and variants is also being considered by the Steering Board, comprised of the Commission and EU Member States, for the EC procurement process.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with this, the new European bio-defence preparedness plan against COVID-19 variants called &ldquo;HERA Incubator&rdquo; will work with researchers, biotech companies, manufacturers and public authorities in the EU and globally to detect new variants, provide incentives to develop new and adapted vaccines, speed up the approval process for these vaccines, and ensure scaling up of manufacturing capacities.</p></reply>

The parties to the agreement have agreed that this new Consultant led Public Health Model will be implemented by December 2023, with the establishment of 34 new consultant posts in the first year, and a total of 84 new consultant posts by end December 2023. The IMO are recommending the agreement to members who are to ballot on it. </p>  <p>  Given the intention to move to a public health consultant led service, the parties are agreed that recruitment to the Public Health Specialist Grade will cease and the Agreement provides accordingly. The Agreement recognises that where vacancies at Specialist-level arise during the reform implementation phase, the HSE may need to recruit at Specialist grade to meet service need.</p>  <p>  Within the model, consultants in Public Health Medicine will lead appropriately resourced multidisciplinary teams, that include surveillance scientists/epidemiologists, senior medical officers, trained contact tracers, administrative and, crucially, robust operations and management support. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to investment in our public health workforce. Last September, I committed to significant investment in Public Health with the announcement of plans to double the current workforce by recruiting an additional 255 permanent staff, at an annual cost of over &euro;17m. This includes public health doctors, nurses, scientists, and support staff.  This is not only a response to the current pandemic but is an investment in the future development of our Public Health function. Recruitment for these posts is ongoing and is a priority for the HSE. To date, 141 permanent positions have been recruited across all areas (medical, nursing, surveillance, and administration) and additional temporary surge capacity has been deployed across all Departments of Public Health (DPH). There are currently 418 WTEs employed across all DPHs which is an increase of 101 since September 2020.</p></reply>

As part of a reform of the organisation of the current public health system, Consultants in Public Health Medicine will be deployed in line with the forthcoming Regional Health Areas. </p>  <p>  Public Health Medicine is about improving and protecting the health of the population, as a whole. Consultants in Public Health Medicine have specialist knowledge of health protection, health service development and health improvement. Their expertise and input will be invaluable in progressing these initiatives and ensuring that they are designed to best serve our population's health needs. Consultants in Public Health Medicine will be invited to contribute to the development of these projects including serving on project oversight groups.  </p>  <p>  The next implementation phase of Sl&aacute;intecare is currently being finalised. Subject to approval, there will be a focus over the coming three years on Improving Timely Access to Care and Addressing Health Inequalities with a number of proposed projects centring on health system structural reforms, financial management reforms, community health promotion initiatives and capital infrastructure improvements.

Public Health Doctors provide health protection services, advocate and contribute to health improvement and participate in health service development. Each Department is led by a Director of Public Health who is also a regional Medical Officer of Health and has a mandated responsibility and authority to investigate and control notifiable infectious diseases and outbreaks. </p>  <p>  Our Public Health Doctors have been to the forefront of our response to the pandemic and the role of the public health doctor has transitioned very rapidly from one of leading small, confined teams, to now leading and directing the activities of a very broad range of organisations and large multidisciplinary teams. They have made an enormous contribution to the protection of everybody living in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The past year has highlighted the critical national importance of an appropriately resourced public health workforce, and through the Covid-19 Path Ahead Plan, this Government has committed to investment in, and resourcing of public health and the delivery of a strengthened and reformed consultant-delivered public health model.</p>  <p>  The new model will radically change the governance and operating structure within Public Health, introducing a more fit-for-purpose National and Regional management structure across each of the pillars of Public Health.</p>  <p>  This will be a Consultant-led model which will enable the recruitment and retention of Public Health Doctors with the capability, autonomy, authority and accountability to lead multidisciplinary teams to deliver an agile, dynamic, intelligence-led public health service to protect the population from health threats, promote health, improve health services and tackle health inequalities.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the Consultant role will also bring the status of this specialty in line with other countries, as Ireland has, for many years, been an outlier in not recognising the specialty at consultant status.</p></reply>

This Spending Review is to be published as part of the 2021 Spending Review series in July 2021. It will be subject to both internal and external review before publication and will be made available, along with all other published spending reviews of all Government Departments, at <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/7dc2b1-spending-review/</i>. </p><p>The ESRI are also working on long-range analysis of projections of demand for healthcare in Ireland for the period 2015-2030 through the development of the Hippocrates Model. The first report from this can be found here - <i>www.esri.ie/publications/projections-of-demand-for-healthcare-in-ireland-2015-2030-first-report-from-the</i>.</p><p>I would also like to inform the Deputy that my Department and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are actively engaged in implementing effective policy levers across a number of domains and under several initiatives to enhance services and generate savings in pharma expenditure.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. These include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost, the potential or actual budget impact, and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p><p>In addition, the prescribing of Best Value Biologic medicines is leading to significant savings for the health service, which is assisting us in facilitating access to new, innovative medicines for patients. In 2019, the HSE introduced the Gainshare Initiative, which provides a financial incentive to public hospitals and clinics to pursue biosimilar treatment switching programmes. By December 2020, almost 12,000 patients have switched to a best-value-biologic (BvB), almost 57% of the claims submitted to PCRS for payment was for the BvB alternative to the originator biologic and associated annual savings in excess of &euro;46 million has been achieved. Despite the impediment of Covid-19, the HSE are progressing well in achieving savings in this area whilst maintaining the engagement of clinicians and the confidence of patients in the safety and efficacy of this technology.</p><p>Ireland has also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, Ireland joined the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Initiative is in line with the objective of working with other European countries to identify workable collaborative solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which aims to assist member states' planning and allocation of resources with respect to new medicines.</p><p>While progress has been positive, the Department of Health and HSE are continuously monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of current levers to ensure that the State can capitalise on the most efficient policy approach.</p></reply>

These are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.  </p>  <p>  The event described must also be considered at this time in the context of the Level 5 restrictive measures which currently remain in place. Any measures introduced at any level of the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; the Path Ahead are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19 and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. </p>  <p>  The Government announced a slight easing of restrictions from 12 April in recognition of the significant impact that the extended period of Level 5 restrictions is having on people. The focus of this easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities in order to improve the health and wellbeing of society. The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position again at the end of this month and it is anticipated that a roadmap for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be agreed.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens.

Quarantine in other facilities or locations is not permitted unless outlined in the provisions of the Health Act, such as where a person completes their quarantine in a medical facility while undergoing treatment.</p><p>The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on gov.ie/quarantine. </p><p>The provisions of the Act also allows for travellers to request a review of decisions relating to their quarantine; however this can only be undertaken once quarantine has begun and for limited reasons set out in the legislation. The State Liaison Officer (Irish Defence Forces) in the hotel provides passengers with information on how to apply.</p><p>Quarantine of persons arriving from areas with a high incidence of variants of concern is considered a deterrent against the emergence of such variants in the state and as such all persons arriving from a designated state are required to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine unless otherwise exempt.  </p><p>The Expert Advisory Group on Travel continues to keep the list of designated states under review on an ongoing basis. The Chief Medical Officer considers EAGT recommendations and in turn makes recommendations when considering the designation of individual states.</p><p>The Government continues to evaluate wider policy on international travel as informed by the epidemiological situation and public health advice, including the possibility of future exemptions, such as for certain categories of essential workers. </p><p>Public health will remain a paramount consideration.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. </p>  <p>  This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, the Programme for Government commits to introducing this amendment to the Nursing Home Support Scheme and work on the legislation has continued to progress. Officials in my Department and draftspeople in the Office of the Attorney General have been working intensively on drafting this legislation for several months, and I am pleased to say that a finalised draft of the Bill has now been signed by the Attorney General. I am sure you will appreciate that several steps must be completed before the Bill is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, including its approval by Government. I expect to bring the Bill to Cabinet for approval in the next couple of weeks. It will be published very shortly thereafter and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></reply>

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It was therefore necessary for my predecessor to enact new legislation under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p>  <p>  The previous Government gave a commitment to commence a strategic review of the role of community pharmacists and to engage with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to develop revised contractual terms. It is my intention to honour that commitment as the existing GMS pharmacy contract is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training.</p>  <p>  The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.</p></reply>

The survey was completed by almost 2,000 Irish students aged 15 and 16 years and found that 39% of students surveyed reported having ever used an e-cigarette; of these 16% reported using one in the last 30 days. Separately, the Health Behaviour in School Age Children Study (HBSC) 2018 found that 22% of 12-17 year olds reported having tried e-cigarettes. Both the ESPAD and HBSC surveys received funding from my Department and are publicly available. </p>  <p>  In October 2020 the Health Research Board delivered the findings of an evidence review on e-cigarettes. The review found that use of e-cigarettes is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking in adolescents. It also found that while electronic cigarettes may represent a reduction in harm relative to smoking, they are not harmless. The Health Research Board review was commissioned by my department and is available on their website. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill provides for a prohibition on the sale of e-cigarettes to, or by, persons under the age of 18. The Bill will also introduce a licensing system for the retail sale of nicotine inhaling products. The General Scheme of the Bill is with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and has also been referred to the Oireachtas Committee on Health for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny.</p></reply>

However, Level 5 restrictive measures currently remain in place. Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19 and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. </p>  <p>  The Government announced a phased easing of restrictions over April in recognition of the significant impact that the extended period of Level 5 restrictions is having on people. The focus of this easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities in order to improve the health and wellbeing of society. Furthermore, from 26 April, maximum attendance at funerals increased to 25. </p>  <p>  The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position and this week a reopening plan for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be announced.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to avoid the virus spreading.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:  </p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; </p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; </p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>People with chronic severe respiratory disease (for example, severe cystic fibrosis, severe COPD, severe pulmonary fibrosis) will be vaccinated in Group 4. Vaccination of this group began in March. </p><p>People with other chronic respiratory disease (for example, stable cystic fibrosis, severe asthma (continuous or repeated use of systemic corticosteroids), moderate COPD) will be vaccinated in Group 5 or Group 7, depending on their age. </p></reply>

The review provides an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy from 2017 to 2020, progress achieved to-date under the action plan, any new issues that have arisen including the impact of Covid-19 and to consider the development of new actions to address emerging needs and challenges. </p>  <p>  The National Oversight Committee gives leadership and direction to support the strategy. The committee has membership from statutory, voluntary and community sector and is chaired by me as Minister for State. The committee has received regular updates on the mid-term review and a draft report will be presented to a special meeting of the committee in May for its consideration.  </p>  <p>  The review when finalised will be brought to Government for approval. Publication of the review and supporting documents will follow soon thereafter.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure that the national drugs strategy is relevant and appropriate to address the societal challenges arising from the use of drugs, especially for children and young people and for those at greatest risk of harm. </p></reply>

The Department of Health provides over &euro;150 million to drug and alcohol services every year to support the strategy. </p>  <p>  The Health Research Board reports annually on the number of cases treated for problem drug and alcohol use. In 2019, there were 10,666 cases treated for problem drug use and 7,546 cases treated for problem alcohol use. This data includes 1,571 inpatient drug treatment cases, where the client attending the service stays overnight, e.g., in-patient detoxification, therapeutic communities, respite, and step down, and 2,806 inpatient alcohol treatment cases. </p>  <p>  It is important when looking at waiting lists for drug and alcohol services to be aware of the impact COVID-19 had on society and particularly on drug and alcohol service provision. Several factors have impacted on waiting lists for drug and alcohol detoxification over the course of the pandemic. These include (a) a reduction in capacity to comply with public health guidance, (b) restrictions on new entries, (c) closures due to outbreaks and (d) difficulties carrying out face to face assessments and validating waiting lists as many of the interactions are telephone only. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the necessary Covid-19 safeguards have resulted in increases in waiting times for residential addiction treatment across the country ranging from an average of 2-6 weeks in some services to an average of 6-9 months in other services. The HSE cannot change the capacity issues that have arisen due to the introduction of social distancing measures to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the limitations of Covid-19, the Department of Health provided an additional &euro;2 million for residential drug and alcohol treatment services in 2021. This funding will provide an additional 100 stabilisation treatment episodes as part of the North East Inner City initiative, a further 150 episodes nationally in tier 4 residential treatment services and 100 treatment episodes in a residential step-up treatment facility for CHOs 3, 4 and 5. In addition, over &euro;1.3 million is being provided for the establishment of a 20 bed residential therapeutic community for expectant women and women with children in the mid-west region, which will cater for 125 episodes per annum.</p>  <p>  In summary this &euro;3.3m in additional funding will provide an additional 475 treatment episodes this year.  </p>  <p>  Several important initiatives have been introduced to restore and continue access to drug and alcohol services during Covid-19.  The Department of Health has issued guidance for the operation of drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes during COVID-19, including in level 5.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department has developed a 'Framework for the &lsquo;Restoration and Continuation of Drug and Alcohol services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. To support the Framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings, and personal protective equipment.  In addition, the HSE has also provided guidance for the safe delivery of residential treatment services.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the provision of drug and alcohol treatment services. I acknowledge the challenges faced by service providers during Covid-19 and will continue to support service providers to fully resume services.   </p></reply>

The medical practitioner must certify this opinion and three days must elapse between certification and the procedure being carried out.</p>  <p>  Sections 9 and 10 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 set out other grounds on which termination of pregnancy is permitted in this country. Section 9 requires that two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, are of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; the foetus has not reached viability; and it is appropriate to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert the risk concerned.

It provides that a termination of pregnancy may be carried out by a medical practitioner who, having examined the pregnant woman, is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that there is an immediate risk to the life or of serious harm to the health of the pregnant woman, and it is immediately necessary to carry out the termination of pregnancy in order to avert that risk.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to intervene in medical practice to suggest how medical practitioners treat their patients, or to dictate the practice of obstetrics.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.2412.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800124#WRVV03800"><p>The commitment to promoting women's health is highlighted within the Programme for Government. This includes a specific commitment to supporting "the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland". A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.</p>  <p>  The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports such as the establishment of a centre of excellence for endometriosis surgery and optional access to psychologists in women&rsquo;s health settings, and enhanced information including a clear patient flow for period/pelvic pain and excessive bleeding and a communications and education strategy to raise awareness of endometriosis and the supports and treatments available.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo; to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. On 21 April I announced the first two areas to be funded from the Fund: two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services in Tallaght and Limerick/Nenagh and the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital.</p>  <p>  The expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, with an associated cost of &euro;641k, will deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland. Endometriosis is estimated to affect 1 in 10 women and represents one of the top four categories of symptoms that comprise approximately 80% of gynaecology referrals. The provision of a secure, supported, expanded and specialist service in Tallaght University Hospital will help to improve both clinical outcomes and overall care experience for women suffering from this debilitating condition.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy may wish to note that the  HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care commenced in 2020, and the first three clinics were established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway and are providing services. Development funding has been provided in 2021, which will accelerate the implementation of the Model of Care, through the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics this year.  Subject to available resources, it is envisaged that up to 19 such clinics will be rolled out in the coming years.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has also asked about treatment abroad for endometriosis. The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled under EU Regulation 883/04.  The TAS is a consultant lead scheme and allows for an Ireland-based public consultant to refer a public patient who is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in the public healthcare system of another EU member state, the UK or Switzerland. Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved public treatments in another EU/EEA member state, the UK or Switzerland through the issue of form S2 (IE) where the treatment is: </p>  <p>  - Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation, </p>  <p>  - Not available in Ireland, </p>  <p>  - Not available within the time normally  necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's  current state of health and the probable course of the disease. medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs; </p>  <p>  - a proven form of medical treatment and  not experimental or test treatment; </p>  <p>  - provided in a recognised public hospital or other institution that will accept EU/EEA form S2 (IE) and; </p>  <p>  - is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health I do not have a role in directing insurers to provide coverage for treatments beyond those prescribed in the minimum benefit regulations. The minimum benefit regulations provide that all health insurance contracts must provide cover for a broad range of in-patient hospital services, and these include laparoscopy for diagnosis and/or treatment of endometriosis. I would advise any health insurance customer seeking treatment for endometriosis to consult their table of benefits and contact their insurer to determine what treatments their health insurance contract covers.</p>  <p>  When it comes to treatment abroad via health insurance for endometriosis, again this differs depending on the health insurance contract in question. The minimum benefit regulations do not provide that health insurers must provide cover for treatment abroad, but many plans do where a treatment is medically necessary and the required procedure is not available in Ireland. Again, I would advise a health insurance customer seeking treatment abroad for endometriosis or any other condition to consult the table of benefits for their health insurance contract and to contact their insurer when planning treatment abroad.</p></reply>

It is a criminal offence to give misleading or fraudulent information to an Irish immigration official.</p><p>As of 17<sup>th</sup>April, passengers who are fully vaccinated and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance.</p><p>Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered fully vaccinated.</p><p>The following table sets out the definition of &lsquo;fully vaccinated&rsquo;; <table>    <tr>       <th>Type of Vaccine</th>       <th>You are regarded as fully vaccinated after</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pfizer-BioNtech </td>       <td>7 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Moderna </td>       <td>14 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oxford-AstraZeneca </td>       <td>15 days after 2nd dose</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen</td>       <td>14 days after single dose</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p><p>Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have a role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p><p>The Government continues to advise against all non-essential international travel.</p></reply>

Professional counsellors can provide information on all options, including continued pregnancy supports and abortion services.</p><p>The HSE recommends that people should only visit a HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy counselling agency. A list of HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy agencies is available at<i> </i></p><p>The HSE continuously monitors the situation and promotes the My Options service through a number of channels, including by posting unplanned pregnancy support messages across social media channels, Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to signpost the My Options website, and radio advertisements delivered during the year.</p><p>The HSE has advised that as the My Options website <i>(myoptions.ie</i>) is now well-established, the organic search performs exceptionally well for keywords relating to unplanned pregnancy and abortion. My Options Google search advertisements also perform well, with a high impression share.</p><p>The Deputy may recall that in 2019, a disingenuous agency began using &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; in the name of their website, causing confusion and putting people at risk of attending a disingenuous service. To counteract this, the HSE issued a statement to the media, reminding people to only visit a HSE-funded unplanned pregnancy counselling agency, and to check for the HSE logo or name if looking for information online. A High Court Case was also taken against the owner of a website, which was settled in favour of the HSE.</p><p>The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme has produced guidelines to assist HSE funded counselling service providers in responding to complaints in this area.</p><p>In addition, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence through statutory registration of health and social care professions designated under the Act. The professions of counsellor and psychotherapist were designated for regulation by the Minister under the Act and will be regulated by CORU.</p><p>Regulations to designate the two professions under the Act and to establish the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board were made in 2018. The Board was appointed in February 2019 and held its inaugural meeting in May 2019. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some of the more established professions, owing to the different and complex entry paths into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.</p><p>The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists. This work includes the scoping of professions and titles and the consideration of the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and for future graduates.</p><p>When the Board has opened the register and the transitional period to allow existing practitioners to register is completed, it will be an offence for anyone not registered to use any protected titles. All registrants will also be subject to the fitness to practice process in CORU which provides for sanctions against registrants when complaints are proven.</p></reply>

However, it is important to recognise that the challenges our maternity hospitals face vary considerably between hospitals and that significant variations in case load, complexity and infrastructure exist throughout the system. In that regard local flexibility is required to account for the different circumstances that may arise in different maternity units and decisions on restrictions are therefore made, implemented, and reviewed at hospital level. </p>  <p>  The National Women&rsquo;s &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that as the situation regarding community transmission continues to improve, and as the immunisation of frontline workers begins to take effect, the Programme is engaging with the clinical leads in each maternity network to support the phased relaxation of restrictions and provide advice on any areas of particular challenge.</p>  <p>  In that context I have asked the National Women&rsquo;s and Infants Health Programme, HSE to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:  </p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; </p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; </p><p>- improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i>https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/ </i></p><p>Vaccination of Group 4 began in March and vaccine registration for Groups 5 and 6 began on the 15th of April.</p><p>In relation to family carers, it is important to emphasise that:</p><p>(a) carers who are healthcare workers are at a very high or high risk of exposure to the virus. In the first wave of the pandemic, over 30% cases were in healthcare workers. Whereas, family carers operate in a completely different and more controlled environment and do not have the same risk of exposure to the virus;</p><p>(b) family carers can minimise their contacts, employ physical distancing, hand washing, respiratory and cough etiquette and, hence, minimise their risk of infection and, thereby, the risk of transmitting infection to a vulnerable person;</p><p>(c) there is emerging evidence that is encouraging regarding the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to impact viral transmission. However, there is insufficient evidence at the current time to justify a change from the current strategy of prioritising those at increased risk of severe disease and/or death as a consequence of COVID-19, to one aimed at reducing transmission. </p></reply>

A sub-group has also been established to develop an individualised Risk Assessment that can be carried out in respect of clients returning to the services.  It will not be feasible at present under Level 5 restrictions and current guidance in place to deliver a service in a congregated setting but plans will be put in place in conjunction with Public Health advice by each service in relation to the resumption of services so that Day Care Services can resume as soon as it is considered safe to provide the service.  </p>  <p>   Areas to be focused on will include:-  </p>  <p>  - Safe transport </p>  <p>  - Protection of carers who have not been vaccinated and the impact of this. </p>  <p>  - Identification of clients who are safe to return to Day Care Services. </p>  <p>  - Supports for clients who will not be in a position to return to Day Care Services. </p>  <p>   The HSE has reassured the Department that it will continue to focus on the re-opening of Day Care Services as a priority and the Focus Group in place will continue to drive a plan to resume these services as soon as possible.  The Focus Group are due to meet again on 28th April 2021 and the HSE work will continue to work with services to ensure that as many services as possible can re-open as soon as it is safe to operate within a congregated setting. </p>  <p>  It is a priority for me as Minister with special responsibility for older people for day services to resume as soon as possible and I continue to engage with senior officials within the Department and HSE on this very important matter.</p></reply>

DPOs should be distinguished from organisations &ldquo;for&rdquo; persons with disabilities, which provide services and/or advocate on behalf of persons with disabilities. The Committee has also said that while DPOs are a specific type of civil society organisation, there is also a distinction, as the term &ldquo;civil society organisation&rdquo; comprises different kinds of organisations, including research institutes, organisations of service providers and other private stakeholders.

This plan outlines a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services. It sets target times for their safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met. Every phase of the plan has been informed by clinical guidance and putting patient and staff safety first. Decisions in relation to the type and volume of activity will be made at site level based on local COVID-19 numbers, available capacity and guidance from national clinical leads.</p>  <p>  The schedule outlined in the plan for resumption of services will be regularly monitored by the HSE and updated as appropriate, dependant on public health advice and healthcare capacity.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  Mandatory hotel quarantine is also necessary in circumstances where passengers coming from non-designated states do not provide evidence that they have a negative or &lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result from a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival into Ireland. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act allow for travellers to request a review of decisions relating to their quarantine in a designated facility; however, this can only be undertaken once quarantine has begun. Requests for review are submitted to the State Liaison Officer present in each designated facility and are considered by independent appeals officers. Decisions on requests for review are provided within a 24-hour period. The State Liaison Officer (Irish Defence Forces) in the hotel provides passengers with information on how to apply.</p>  <p>  The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine, and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on gov.ie/quarantine.  </p>  <p>  Exemptions for medical reasons pertain to a person who travels to the State for an unavoidable, imperative and time sensitive medical reason and that reason is certified by a person who is a registered medical practitioner or a person holding an equivalent qualification outside the State. Applicable travellers must produce all relevant documentation on arrival to qualify for an exemption. </p>  <p>  The safety, wellbeing and comfort of all guests quarantining in a designated facility is a priority of the mandatory quarantine system, along with protecting people living in Ireland from COVID-19 variants of concern.</p>  <p>  All guests undergoing mandatory hotel quarantine have access to a 24/7 on-site healthcare team during their stay. Guests requiring any specific, urgent or emergency care which cannot be provided on-site may also be referred to a dedicated medical facility by the on-site healthcare team.</p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have any role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-04-28a.2638.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021042800128#WRZZ03200"><p>A Healthy Weight for Ireland&rsquo;, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 as part of the Healthy Ireland Framework.  The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. The Plan recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.</p>  <p>  The OPAP prescribed the following short-term (five-year) targets for overweight and obesity:</p>  <p>   - a sustained downward trend (averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Healthy Ireland Survey) in the level of excess weight averaged across all adults;</p>  <p>   - a sustained downward trend [averaging 0.5% per annum as measured by the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) in the level of excess weight in children, and</p>  <p>   - a reduction in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups by 10%, as measured by the Healthy Ireland and COSI surveys. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Healthy Ireland Survey, for which the field work was carried out between September 2018 and September 2019, found that 37% of those surveyed were overweight and 23% were obese.  These figures are the same as for the 2015 survey.  This indicated that by 2019 the overweight and obesity levels among adults were stabilising, but at a high level and were not showing signs of a sustained decline.</p>  <p>  The report of the 5th Round of COSI was published in October 2020, and anthropometric measurements for this survey were carried out between October 2018 and January 2019.  This report found that overall levels of overweight and obesity among primary school children stood at 19.1%, and that these levels appeared to be continuing to plateau.  However, the report did not find the levels to be plateauing in DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted upon the survey methods used to obtain these statistics.  Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Healthy Ireland Survey was conducted by computer aided personal interview (CAPI) in respondents&rsquo; own homes, which allowed for in-person measurements of height, weight, waist circumference and BMI to be conducted. However, the most recent wave of the Healthy Ireland Survey, for which results have not yet been published, was conducted by computer aided telephone interview (CATI). This methodology is in line with current necessary COVID-19 restrictions and infection control requirements but does not enable measurement in person.  The Department is committed to administering the Healthy Ireland survey annually. The eighth wave, scheduled to commence interviewing in the Autumn, will be conducted using CATI. The possibility of returning to the CAPI format will be reviewed annually. Presentation and interpretation of the survey trends will take account of the switch to the CATI methodology.</p>  <p>  While the data in relation to the targets in the OPAP are not complete, it is clear that obesity remains a significant challenge.  For this reason, there is a renewed focus on combatting obesity by this government, and a particular emphasis on addressing health inequalities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.  In terms of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan, an evaluation of the policy is being carried out by the Centre for Health and Diet Research in University College Cork, which is expected to be completed by June 2021.  This will be an important input to the mid-term review of the OPAP which will be carried out this year, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>-  protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>-  facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>-  improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>People aged 16-69 with severe cystic fibrosis will be vaccinated in Group 4. Vaccination of this Group began in March.</p><p>People aged 65-69 with stable cystic fibrosis will be vaccinated in Group 5.

However, Level 5 restrictive measures currently remain in place. Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19 and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>The Government announced a phased easing of restrictions over April in recognition of the significant impact that the extended period of Level 5 restrictions is having on people. The focus of this easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities in order to improve the health and wellbeing of society.</p><p>The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position again later this week and it is anticipated that a roadmap for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be agreed, including in relation to weddings.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens.

The Expert Panel report has added further to our knowledge and learning. This report clearly outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes. These actions are based on learning from our own and the international experience of Covid-19 to date. The report also recommends additional analysis and examination of the relevant public health and other data sets in order that further causal and protective factors for Covid-19 clusters are identified.</p><p>Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to Covid-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Continued learning and understanding of progression of the disease in Ireland is an integral part of those recommendations. Residents of nursing homes are vulnerable because of their age, underlying medical conditions, the extent of their requirement for direct care involving close physical contact and the nature of living in congregated settings. The very infectious nature of Covid-19 makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings. The transmission of the virus into and within nursing homes is multifactorial. As identified by the Nursing Homes Expert Panel, where there is ongoing community transmission, settings like nursing homes are more vulnerable to exposure. </p><p>The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need to set up a structured support system in line with NPHET recommendations. This has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with Covid-19. The Expert Panel highlighted the value of those supports and recommended their continuation. These supports continue to be provided. </p><p>The range of supports provided to nursing homes include: </p><p>- Enhanced HSE engagement; </p><p>- Multidisciplinary clinical supports at CHO level through 23 Covid-19 Response Teams;</p><p>- Supply of precautionary and enhanced PPE, free of charge;</p><p>- Serial testing programme for all staff of nursing homes; </p><p>- Where possible, access to staff from community and acute hospitals; </p><p>- Suite of focused public health guidance and training resources. </p><p>- Temporary accommodation to nursing home staff to support measures to block the chain of transmission;</p><p>- HIQA implemented a Regulatory Assessment Framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a Covid-19 outbreak and published an InfectionPrevention and Control Assurance Framework for Nursing Homes</p><p>In addition a temporary financial support scheme established for private and voluntary nursing homes, has provided over &euro;86.4m in additional funding support as of 23 April.

For example, in recognition of the effective vaccine rollout to nursing home residents, and the increasing evidence of the protection conferred by full vaccination, new guidance has been developed that further expands the scope of visiting. </p><p>People living in nursing homes where there is high vaccine coverage will be facilitated with four routine visits every week from 4th May </p><p>Although the situation in nursing homes has greatly improved, the risk associated with Covid-19 remains very real.

Anyone who is worried about symptoms at any time is advised not to wait for screening but to contact their GP immediately, for appropriate follow-up care.</p>  <p>   As with all our national screening programmes, BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for population-based screening programmes, which are kept under constant review. </p>  <p>  The balance between the benefits of screening and the potential harms or risks to the population as a whole require careful, evidence-based consideration and balancing. </p>  <p>  Decisions about changes to our national screening programmes will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee.  This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice.</p></reply>

The Committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the schools-based immunisation programme for the 2019/2020 academic year has been completed and the uptake rates for the HPV vaccine in that academic year are 82% for the first dose of the vaccine and 77% for the second dose. </p>  <p>  This is the highest uptake for the HPV vaccination programme since 2015/2016 and is particularly encouraging because it was the first year that boys were included in the programme and it shows that the provision of vaccine in community clinics did not adversely affect the uptake.</p>  <p>  The programme for the academic year 2020/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the Covid-19 immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme has also been delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. However, Community Healthcare Organisations have reported that the vast majority of second level schools had their first dose of HPV vaccine delivered between October and December 2020.</p>  <p>The uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine in the 2020/2021 academic year, as at 15 April, is 63% and this figure is expected to increase because data input on vaccine uptake is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Plans are now being developed by the HSE for the recommencement of the schools-based vaccination programmes, including the second dose of the HPV vaccine. Some areas have already recommenced these programmes or are in the process of arranging school visits.</p></reply>

This was a key informing principle in the development of the 5 level framework of public health measures last September and in the Government decision last month to commence the easing of some measures over April which are focused specifically on outdoor activities. </p><p>It is important to note, however, that while outdoors is safer, it is not risk-free. It is important to continue to practice social distancing and other safe behaviours when meeting people outdoors and masks should be worn in crowded outdoor spaces. </p><p>HIQA undertook an evidence review on higher-risk environments and activities for the NPHET in November 2020, drawing on national and international evidence. The Review found that while there is consistent evidence that the risk of outdoor transmission of COVID-19 is substantially lower, there is still evidence of transmission occurring in outdoor environments. This is particularly the case when there are large gatherings, where social distancing or the use of face coverings are neglected, and where there is dense congregation and mixing among groups. There are also risks linked to what might precede and follow outdoor gatherings including associated events and activities and shared travel to or from events or activities. The review is available at:</p><p>https://www.hiqa.ie/reports-and-publications/health-technology-assessment/activities-or-settings-associated-higher-risk </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the NPHET. HIQA, at the request of the NPHET, is undertaking a regular review of the public health measures and strategies that are in place internationally to limit the spread of COVID-19. These reviews are available online at:</p><p>. </p><p>In its most recent review which was considered by NPHET on 22 April, hospitality remains restricted to take-away and delivery services in the majority of countries examined.</p><p>The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position again later this week and it is anticipated that a roadmap for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be agreed.</p></reply>

Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>improving transparency and fairness. </p><p>Further details are available here:</p><p>Vaccination of Group 4 (people aged 16-69 with a medical condition that puts them at very high risk of severe disease and death) began in March. Vaccine registration for Group 5 (people aged 65-69 whose underlying condition puts them at a high risk of severe disease and death) began on 15 April.</p></reply>

The focus of this easing of measures is on enabling more outdoor activities in order to improve the health and well-being of society. The situation will be subject to ongoing review taking account of the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the reopening of priority services, and available evidence in relation to vaccine deployment, uptake and effectiveness. The NPHET and the Government will consider the position again at the end of this month and it is anticipated that a roadmap for the further easing of measures over the coming months will be agreed.</p><p>From 26th April, outdoor visitor attractions can reopen (for example: zoos, open pet farms, heritage sites).

This includes increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation. </p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.

Publication of this legislation is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in Ireland, of a wide range of practices, including: embryo and stem cell research. The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Bill stipulates the conditions under which research involving embryos, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells may be permitted, subject to obtaining a licence from the Regulatory Authority. This Part of the Bill prohibits the creation of embryos specifically for research purposes and also prohibits certain practices that may be associated with embryo and stem cell research, for example, the generation of chimeric or human-animal hybrid embryos. </p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.</p></reply>

The Department of Health provides over &euro;130 million to drug and alcohol services to support the strategy.</p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in implementing the national drugs strategy at the local level. They assess the extent and nature of the drug problem and initiate appropriate responses, so that there is a coordinated approach involving all sectors to the problem of substance misuse in local communities and local communities are consulted in the design and deliver services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health provides &euro;28m in funding to the 24 drug and alcohol task forces that operate throughout the country in defined geographical areas. The Department engages with key stakeholders in the network of drug and alcohol task forces and takes input on the level of need in local communities, from those service providers working in the community. This in turn informs decision-making relating to the allocation of funding and provision of services.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has developed a 'Framework for the &lsquo;Restoration and Continuation of Drug and Alcohol services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. To support the Framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings, and personal protective equipment.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1 million was provided in Budget 2021 to develop targeted drug and alcohol initiatives through the network of drug and alcohol task forces. The allocation of this funding will be informed by the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy and strategic action plan 2021-2025, which will be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  Over the last few months, I have met with drug and alcohol task forces to discuss support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs, including the challenges for people who use drugs during Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure that the additional resources are directed towards those interventions which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem drug use and a positive improvement in public health. In particular, the funding should be used to expand the availability of drug and alcohol services in communities based on identified need, especially in communities that have limited access to services at the moment. I will announce details of the new &euro;1m funding programme shortly.</p></reply>

This commitment is underlined by the significant increase of &euro;50 million in Exchequer funds for HSE Mental Health Services in 2021. </p>  <p>  The Department welcomes the report on mental health services for older people published by the Mental Health Commission. It should be noted that there is a wide range of mental supports for older people in place. Nationally, there are 32 psychiatry of later life community teams. These teams support people to remain in their homes and in the community where possible, in line with Slaintecare recommendations. In addition, the HSE provides over 400 inpatient mental health beds dedicated for older people. </p>  <p>  Healthy ageing and the mental health of older people was recognised as a key consideration during the development of Sharing the Vision. The policy identifies the importance of promoting positive mental health in the older population and of providing appropriate specialist mental health services to older people. Late last year, a National Implementation and Monitoring Committee was established to drive and oversee implementation of the policy over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the HSE launched the Specialist Geriatric Services model of care. It outlines how specialist mental health services for people aged 65 and over should be developed appropriately to focus on supporting the mental health needs of this group. </p>  <p>  The model of care recognises the importance of integrated care. It focuses on a number of areas, including improving clinical pathways in the community and acute hospitals and building on relationships with primary care and geriatric medicine. </p>  <p>  This programme is complemented by the recent launch of the HSE Model of Care for Talking Therapies, which applies to all adults, including those over 65. </p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Framework makes a clear commitment to improving partnerships, strategies and initiatives that support older people to maintain, improve or manage their physical and mental wellbeing, by addressing risk factors and promoting protective measures to support lifelong health and wellbeing. </p>  <p>  The Framework will also lead to increased mental health supports for those in long-term palliative care and the development of age-friendly services in community and primary care settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Department of Health&rsquo;s Keep Well campaign for living with Covid, &euro;7 million has been invested to support the delivery of wellbeing and resilience initiatives with a range of partners. These initiatives include supports for older people.</p>  <p>  Of course, the existing range of mental health supports available, including those promoted through yourmentalhealth.ie or 1800 111 888 can be accessed by older people. These include for example free online counselling delivered though MyMind.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from, the social and medical impacts of an illness.</p>  <p>  Regarding long Covid, as COVID 19 is still a relatively new disease information on it, its features and its course are just emerging. Longer term observational studies will be required to fully understand the health consequences presently being attributed to post COVID-19 infection and management of persisting symptoms that will in time provide higher quality evidence and assist guideline development for appropriate provision of care. It is noted however that medical card holders can access GP and hospital services free of charge irrespective of the type of illness.</p></reply>

Project Woodland has been established and working groups are actively examining the backlog with the aim of improving the rate of licensing in accordance with environmental compliance. The afforestation scheme is a demand-led scheme and its participation is voluntary. The Government's target is to aim to achieve an afforestation rate of 8,000 hectares and the area planted in any particular year is dependent on a wide number of factors.</p>  <p>  The Irish forestry sector currently has approximately 4,300 hectares of available land licenced and ready to plant since last year. In addition, the Department has approved 1,700 new hectares year to date. It is essential that every licence is used if possible as any non-utilisation is a waste of everybody's valuable resources.</p>  <p>  The size of the nursery sector and forests sector is dependent on the total forest estate and projected harvesting rates which is forecast to increase significantly from approximately four million cubic metres to close to eight million cubic metres by 2035. This level of harvest will see an increase in road construction and increased areas of reforestation as areas are felled into the future. Taking into consideration that the State has invested over &euro;3 billion in forestry supports over the last 30 years significant economic activity will occur due to increased harvesting.</p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge that an effective and efficient licensing system is essential to drive that activity and the Department is committed to addressing the current issues associated with the backlog. Achieving increased levels of afforestation and reforestation will determine the size of the nursery sector and my Department will continue to put in place measures to encourage landowners to plant trees on their holdings.</p></reply>

The Project Board is being chaired by the Secretary General.</p>  <p>  The Working Groups are working concurrently focusing on different areas.

In this regard, there are two Access Officers appointed who are responsible for providing or arranging for assistance and guidance to persons with disabilities accessing services provided by the Department. In addition, Department officials are available in all regions to help customers who have questions or concerns on any scheme operated by the Department.</p>  <p>  Our website has been redesigned to comply with the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and National Disability Authority (NDA) guidelines and this includes ensuring content is at a suitable reading comprehension level. The on-line self-service options have been developed in a manner which means that  customers are not obliged to visit an office and can complete their submissions from home, at a time and pace that suits them. The Department also operates phone helplines for customers that prefer to access our services in this manner and there is also an option for a customer to nominate a representative, such as a family member, to liaise with us on their behalf.</p>  <p>  The majority of schemes run by the Department are co-funded by the European Union. In designing schemes included in our Rural Development Programme (RDP) which falls under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the approval of these schemes by the European Commission was contingent on Ireland satisfying a range of  what are termed 'ex ante conditionalities'. As part of this process, the Commission was required to confirm the involvement in the RDP consultation process of bodies responsible for the promotion of equal treatment across a range of areas, including disability. This requirement was also reflected in the membership of the RDP Monitoring Committee which was established in order to monitor the implementation of the schemes included in the RDP.</p>  <p>  While the range of schemes administered by my Department do not contain specific top up payments, in the last Budget, I secured an important support for disabled farmers with the introduction of Accelerated Capital Allowances for farm safety equipment. This change to the capital allowance treatment of certain farm safety equipment and adaptive equipment for farmers with disabilities places a particular emphasis on supporting those who have suffered life-changing injuries as a result of incidents on farms. With an annual budget of &euro;5m, eligible equipment includes modified controls and seating for farm vehicles as well as access lifts, hoists and wheelchair docking stations.</p></reply>

The project will feed into the development of the next national agri-environment scheme to follow on from GLAS. Similar to the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) projects, REAP is designed to focus on key learning objectives.</p>  <p>  The REAP scorecard based system has been developed to assess the sustainability of agricultural grasslands and is not designed to assess other habitat types such as those typically found on commonages and lands containing heather. It is a targeted measure for farmers not currently particpating in other agri-environment schemes. </p>  <p>  The REAP project is a short-term transitional measure which uses additional funding I secured in the budget for farmers for this year. This necessitated a quick turnaround on scheme design in order to have the scheme launched, the actions complete by the farmer and money paid to the participating farmers by the end of the year. We are on track to achieve this currently but it is an extremely tight timeframe.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that several EIP projects are testing measures/scorecards on these types of land and it is important to avoid duplicating the work of the other projects. For example, EIPs such as the Hen Harrier Project, Pearl Mussel Project, the North Connemara Locally Led Agri-environmental Scheme, A Sustainable Agricultural Plan for the MacGillycuddy Reeks, Sustainable Uplands Agri-environment Scheme SUAS, Inishowen Upland Farmers Project as well as the Blackstairs Farming Futures (BFF) Sustainable Farming Project include these land types.</p>  <p>  The commonage action is also being under taken by 9,000 farmers in the GLAS scheme, including those in Tranches 1 and 2 of the scheme who have opted to extend their GLAS contracts and for an additional year in 2021.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the long term sustainability of upland hill and commonage farming. These farmers contribute massively in terms of biodiversity and ensuring we have balanced regional development. I, and the rest of the Government, unashamedly support these farmers and will continue to do so in the next CAP.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that the two score cards developed can be tested on the appropriate enterprise types.</p>  <p>  The Low Input Grassland scorecard has been designed to be largely suited to extensive farmer and the Multi-Species Ley has been designed with medium intensive farmers in mind.

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s. The possibility of a dredging project has been under consideration for some time.</p><p>The project will involve the dredging of circa 240,000 cubic meters of dredge material and reuse of material in land reclamation. The land reclamation area will provide a mix of recreational public access green areas, slipway access to the water for small craft and provide areas for business, harbour operations and transport. </p><p>My Department tendered for a Consulting Engineering practice on 3<sup>rd</sup>October 2018 to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. </p><p>The project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Assessment Report and a Waste License.  A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors.</p><p>As part of the planning process, my Department has recently completed a Public Consultation process and the closure date for submissions was Friday 9th April 2021.</p><p>Following the collation of information received during the consultation process which is currently underway, it is hoped to submit an application for planning permission in May 2021, with the required EPA licencing process to follow after grant of Planning Permission. It is expected that the planning and permitting phase could take at least 12 months.</p><p>As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p><p>All other works in Howth FHC including the Middle Pier Project are stopped under current Government Covid 19 restrictions and will reopen once permitted.</p></reply>

This process is currently live for felling files and will soon be rolled out to road and then afforestation files. While we are still going through the early training and testing stages the early signs are good in terms of the potential the new system has to increase the rate at which files are processed. No doubt, further refinements to the system will be identified as part of the process review. Both additional resources and systems improvements will increase output to ensure we reach the target of 4,500 licences in 2021.</p></reply>

The findings of the inquiry were communicated to Ireland in December 2020. Ireland has subsequently received a Commission Implementing Decision revoking the approval of the Irish control plan submitted for the weighing of fishery products in accordance with Article 61(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.</p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone are law enforcement matters for the Irish control authorities. Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. I am aware that the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) have written to and also met with industry representatives  in relation to the revocation of the derogation in the control plan. It is the responsibility of the SFPA to set out new procedures in relation to this changed position. I am expressly precluded from getting involved in operational matters such as those referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  My officials have commenced a process of engagement with the EU Commission, in association with the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority which is responsible for operational matters. In the context of this engagement, I am not in a position to comment on the EU Commission's findings and the package of measures that the Commissioner has set out. To do so at this juncture would be to prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s position. </p>  <p>  The engagement with the Commission will allow a full evaluation of the findings of the Inquiry and consideration of the actions that the Commission has identified. The EU Commission advised my Department previously that, under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, no documents relating to the administrative enquiry could be made public.</p></reply>

An independent Advisory Board, nominated by my Department was put in place to assist the management of the SFPA in the implementation of the Report. This Board is purely advisory and does not have any executive role in the operations of the SFPA. A dedicated Director of Transformation was appointed to the SFPA in January 2021, with overall responsibility for managing the implementation of the review&rsquo;s recommendations. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations rests with the SFPA, which is an independent agency as set down in the 2006 Act. My role, as Minister, relates solely to corporate governance.</p>  <p>  The 2021 budget allocation of &euro;24.810m is to allow the SFPA to continue to meet its National and EU obligations as Ireland's competent Authority for the enforcement of Sea Fisheries and seafood safety law and to meet challenges arising from Brexit. This budget includes a provision of &euro;5.808m under EU- funded programmes for IT and other developments which previsously had been provided for in the general Department's budget.</p>  <p>  The additional funds have been allocated over recent years to strengthen the Authority. Staff numbers have increased from 104 in October 2017 to 150 in 2021. In addition, a programme of recruitment is planned for this year to provide for strengthened control and enforcement functions, including supporting the new requirements for seafood trade following the UK departure from the EU.</p></reply>

It works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs. The WFP plays a significant role in the UN&rsquo;s global campaign for Zero Hunger (Sustainable Development Goal 2) and is at the forefront of dealing with the migration crisis. For its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.   </p>  <p>  My Department leads on Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the WFP, which is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions. Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the WFP, expressed through three-yearly Strategic Partnership Agreements, was &euro;70million for the period 2019-2021. My Department is currently leading on the preparations for the next SPA (2022-2024). This contribution will help save lives and support food security and nutrition and rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings and it reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s role as one of WFP&rsquo;s most engaged partners.  Ireland also chairs Friends of Nutrition, an informal space where Member States and the World Food Programme can come together to discuss the shared ambition for nutrition. Also, my Department represented Ireland at the WFP Executive Board in 2018 and 2019 as part of the rotating board membership. Ireland will sit on the Board again in 2023.</p></reply>

The Department was unable to recruit an Irish speaker to fill the remaining post but hopes to be able to do so when the opportunity arises.</p><p>Currently, the Department publishes its audited accounts or financial statements as well as any document setting out policy proposals in Irish and English. In addition to meeting its obligations under Section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003, to publish certain documents in both official languages simultaneously, the Department publishes other corporate documents, such as the Customer Charter and Customer Action Plan, the Farmers&rsquo; Charter of Rights and the Schemes and Services booklet, in both Irish and English.

Everyone must play their part in protecting our landscapes and supporting our emergency services and ensuring they are not needlessly diverted by illegal fires. </p><p>There is a inherent natural risk of fire in our uplands and on bogs at this time of year, due to the condition of vegetation in these area. Upland grasses, heather and gorse are highly flammable in spring when the weather is dry. In the right conditions, any ignition, for any reason, can give rise to wildfires. Both landowners and the wider public, whether they are at work or enjoying the countryside, should be mindful of the significant risks of fire at this time of year and be aware of the damage to land and habitats caused by illegal burning and other accidental and unintentional ignitions. The Department conducts a number of activities annually to monitor and reduce wildfire incidence and outcomes.</p><p>The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). This Department has no role in regard to prosecutions.</p><p>The Department has issued reminders to all landowners in relation to illegal burning of agricultural lands, and any land found to have been burned illegally can be deemed ineligible across a number of area-based schemes. The Department monitors fire activity and risk throughout the main risk period between March and September, using a variety of means at our disposal, including satellite detections and ground inspections. </p><p>The Department has also undertaken a number of awareness measures aimed at reducing the level of illegal ignitions, particularly on farmland, and in ensuring that affected sectors are fully prepared for fire outbreaks where these occur. This includes the provision of Fire Danger Rating Notices to relevant sectors and Departments to ensure that the correct level of preparedness is maintained throughout the fire season. The Department also encourages the safe use of fire by land managers during the open burning season, and provides guidance for doing so.</p><p>It is important to note that wildfire ignitions occur from a variety of sources, not just agriculture, and many recent fires have occurred on lands with no associated agricultural activity, including lands used for turf cutting, and public lands with open access used by the public for recreation. Fires associated with illegal dumping on bogland are a particular problem. In 2020, some of the largest and most problematic fires occurred as a result of recreational land user activities.</p><p>The farming community has a central role to play in the control of fire in our landscapes through the management of land, and the reduction and maintenance of fire prone vegetation (such purple moor grass, heather, and gorse/whin) as potential fuels in high fire risk areas. To this end, the Department supports a number of locally-led schemes under the EIP-AGRI measure that in turn support the implementation of fire management activities on the ground including vegetation management activities. Projects of this type are now in place in many of the main fire risk locations in Ireland, including the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, McGillicuddy Reeks, Inishowen Peninsula, Connemara, and within the Hen Harrier Project. </p><p>The Hen Harrier project is a results-based project, supported by the Department, covering key habitats across a number of different counties. The project  has recently developed and implemented a number of specific fire management measures including upland grazing management and support, the development of ponds in high risk areas that can provide water for aerial fire fighting operations, and the safe use of fire as a land management tool by landowners. The project also liaises directly with relevant local fire services in areas where it operates. All of the upland projects involve fire management education and awareness building activities directly with landowners through project agricultural advisors and direct inputs from local fire and rescue services and experts from my Department and Teagasc. </p><p>The Department activated its Fire Danger Rating System back in March for the fire season ahead and to date four such Fire Danger Notices notices have been issued, ahead of risk weather phases. I would advise Forest owners and managers to check and update their fire plans and other relevant contingencies such as insurance, firebreaks, access and water points, and private helicopter contracts etc., so as to be prepared well in advance of high fire risk phases. Rural dwellers should also assess wildfire risks to their homes and properties and prepare accordingly. Guidance for this is available from the Office of Emergency Planning &ldquo;Be Summer Ready&rdquo; awareness campaign <i>www.gov.ie/summerready</i>.</p><p>There has been a very significant increase in the use of outdoor amenities and recreation sites by the public since the onset of Covid-19. This is a very welcome development, however forest visitors are reminded not to light fires or use barbecues, to behave responsibly, observe relevant local bye-laws, observe correct physical distancing practice and to park considerately so as not to impede access of emergency vehicles to incidents. </p><p>There is a very firm link in recent years between serious wildfire ignitions and illegal dumping and burning of domestic waste in many areas, and malicious burning at forest amenity sites and turf bogs open to the public. The Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112/999 service. We all have our part to play in protecting our countryside from uncontrolled fires.</p><p>Fire warnings can be accessed at: <i> and </i></p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980s. The possibility of a dredging project has been under consideration for some time.  </p>  <p>  The project will involve the dredging of circa 240,000 cubic meters of dredge material and reuse of material in land reclamation. The land reclamation area will provide a mix of recreational public access green areas, slipway access to the water for small craft and provide areas for business, harbour operations and transport. </p>  <p>  My Department tendered for a Consulting Engineering practice on 3 October 2018 to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. </p>  <p>  The project will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Assessment Report and a Waste License. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors.</p>  <p>  As part of the planning process, my Department has recently completed a Public Consultation process and the closure date for submissions was Friday 9th April 2021.</p>  <p>  Following the collation of information received during the consultation process which is currently underway, it is hoped to submit an application for planning permission in May 2021, with the required EPA licensing process to follow after grant of Planning Permission. It is expected that the planning and permitting phase could take at least 12 months.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities and must follow the necessary public procurement guidelines.</p></reply>

While I do not have a specific role with regard to broadband or mobile network coverage, as Minister for Rural and Community Development I regularly discuss these matters with my Cabinet colleagues, including the Ministers at the Departments referred to.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to improving connectivity in rural and Gaeltacht areas, as is evidenced by the National Broadband Plan and a suite of measures to improve and make best use of connectivity contained in the new Rural Development Policy: Our Rural Future.</p>  <p>  Through the Broadband Connection Points (BCP) initiative, my department is establishing a national network of approximately 300 community hubs in some of the most remote parts of the country, including areas in Waterford. These hubs will support remote working, skills and education training, eHealth services, and arts and culture and events, depending on the needs and desires of the host communities. More than 160 BCPs are already connected and operational.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points are among the first premises to be connected under the National Broadband Plan and represent a collaboration between my Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, 28 of the 31 Local Authorities and the c.300 communities that will host these services.</p>  <p>  Aside from the BCP project, my Department is leading on a number of initiatives to assist rural and isolated areas to access digital services. These include the WiFi4EU program and the National Hub Network, a key deliverable under the Programme for Government and the Remote Working Policy: Making Remote Work.</p>  <p>  In furtherance of the latter, my Department has been allocated an additional &euro;5m to support the development of the National Hub Network and BCPs. This Fund will support small capital projects that will add remote working capacity. I anticipate making an announcement in respect of the Fund's launch in the very near future.</p>  <p>  I recently announced &euro;75million for 24 landmark projects under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. Many of the successful projects involve the regeneration of historic town centre buildings as Enterprise and Co-Working Hubs. This funding will support connectivity by enabling historic or underused buildings to be utilised as hot-desking facilities, remote working hubs, e-learning or enterprise spaces.</p>  <p>  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is also involved in rolling out a network of innovation and digital hubs on 6 Gaeltacht Islands with high speed broadband connectivity - one of the policy measures outlined in Our Rural Future.</p></reply>

The Fund provides investment to support suitable projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas.</p>  <p>  Calls for applications to the Fund are sought under two categories &ndash; Category 1 and Category 2. Category 1 relates to large scale ambitious capital projects with all necessary planning and other consents in place and which are ready to proceed. Category 2 provides funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future calls for Category 1 applications.</p>  <p>  The application process for the Fund is competitive in nature and applications can be made by State-funded bodies i.e. Local Authorities, Local Development Companies, State agencies, other Government Departments etc. Lead parties to applications are encouraged to partner with other organisations, including communities, to put forward proposals.  </p>  <p>  Applications for the Fund are assessed by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, comprised of representatives from key Government Departments and independent experts. Once that process is complete, my Department prepares a report setting out recommended projects and my role as Minister is to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding.</p>  <p>On 19th   April, I announced funding for 24 projects, including Youghal Public Library, which were successful under a Category 1 call for applications which closed in December 2020. Today, the Taoiseach and I announced that Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal was the final project to emerge as successful from that call for applications. In total, the 25 successful projects under this call will receive funding of &euro;81 million from the Fund and provide total investment in rural areas of just under &euro;100 million. To date, the Fund has provided &euro;249 million for 164 projects across the country, worth a total of &euro;338 million.</p>  <p>  In terms of future plans, I will be announcing a call for Category 2 applications in the coming weeks and a further call for Category 1 applications will be announced later in 2021. Following each announcement, an application form and guidance document will be made available on my Department&rsquo;s website. My Department will also liaise directly with prospective applicants to provide further guidance as necessary.</p></reply>

My Department continues to provide services through Irish to members of the public in Gaeltacht areas as the need arises.</p>  <p>  In terms of services provided through the Irish language for the agencies which come under my remit, I can confirm that Water Safety Ireland forms are available in Irish upon request. </p>  <p>  The Charities Regulator is reviewing all forms for charities and the public on the Charities Regulator website with a view to having them available in Irish and English as soon as possible. There is a small number of legal forms specific to the Charity Services function of the Regulator that are provided to solicitors in English unless otherwise requested. </p>  <p>  Pobal is strongly committed to complying with its obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003. Organisations applying to Pobal for funding are free to complete English language forms in Irish or in English. </p>  <p>  The Western Development Commission (WDC) makes all financial statements, annual reports and Public Appointments Services adverts available in both Irish and English. WDC believes in the promotion of the Irish language and notes the ability to speak the Irish language, by applicants, in all current job applications. Any form drawn up by the WDC can be requested in either Irish or English and will be provided within a reasonable timeframe. The WDC has a number of fluent Irish speakers working within the agency and is happy to deal with Irish language verbal queries as they arise. </p>  <p>  My Department's Irish Language Scheme has been formulated with the intention of ensuring that all relevant obligations under the Official Languages Act, 2003, relating to my Department, are being fully addressed on an incremental basis, through this and future schemes.</p></reply>
