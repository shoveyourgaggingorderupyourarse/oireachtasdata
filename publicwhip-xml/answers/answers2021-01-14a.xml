Government agreed to a limited number of exemptions to this new restriction, including for certain large projects in the Exporting/FDI sector.</p>  <p>  To implement the new measures S.I. No. 4 of 2021 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 10) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 was signed by the Minister for Health on 7 January.</p>  <p>  Paragraph 6 (2) (a) of S.I. 4 of 2021 deals with the exemptions in relation to construction and amends Part 2 of the Schedule of the Principal Regulations - S.I. No. 701 of 2020 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 10) Regulations 2020.</p>  <p>  This amendment provides for the continuation of construction and development projects which are necessary for maintenance of supply chains in respect of manufacturing or information and communication services specified in the Schedule of S.I. 701 of 2020. The manufacturing services referenced include: chemicals, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, IT equipment, products necessary for national and international supply chains, personal hygiene products, etc. Construction and development projects relating to general purpose facilities (for example office accommodation) in respect of such manufacturing services are excluded from the scope of the exemption.</p>  <p>  There is a separate exemption in S.I. 4 of 2021 that provides for construction and development projects that relate to the direct supply of medical products for Covid-19. </p>  <p>  All projects covered by the exemption must continue to adhere to the stringent protocols set out in the Work Safely Protocol and are subject to inspection by the Health and Safety Authority.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to facilitate additional liquidity to SMEs, primary producers and Small Mid-Caps.</p>  <p>  The Scheme operates in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary Framework for State Aid. This Framework has relaxed the levels of state aid permissible to Irish businesses but also has eligibility criteria for the loans that must be met.</p>  <p>  The CCGS provides certainty to businesses that liquidity is available for working capital and investment purposes with loans of up to &euro;1 million available for up to five and a half years being provided at reduced interest rates by participating lenders.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees.</p>  <p>  The Scheme was launched in September with AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank providing lending facilities.  These three banks have facilitated lending of &euro;98.2 million up to the end of December 2020 to a wide range of business sectors across all counties in Ireland.   Businesses which have been significantly impacted by the effects of the virus are utilising the Scheme such as the wholesale and retail sector which accounted for twenty percent of loans drawn by value, the accommodation and food services sector which accounted for thirteen percent of loans drawn by value, and the primary agriculture and fisheries sector accounted for twelve percent of loans drawn by value.</p>  <p>  Government provides an eighty percent guarantee on any claims under the scheme, thereby committing to pay the banks eighty percent of any outstanding principal on defaulted loans.  Banks will therefore not draw down any State funding until such time as there are defaults on loans and claims are submitted in accordance with the terms of the Scheme.  In order to make provision for potential claims, a contingent liability is created in respect of loans drawn.  The maximum contingent liability to the State in respect of loans drawn up to the end of December was &euro;78.55 million.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-14a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011400044#WRA01400"><p>My colleague the Minister for Social Protection who has responsibility for the enhanced illness benefit payment informs me that under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1), the Government, having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of Covid-19, extended the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to illness benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with, or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of COVID-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate for a limited period.  The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  A person is not entitled to the enhanced illness benefit payment in respect of any day of incapacity for work where he or she is entitled to full wages, salary, or paid sick leave under a contract of employment, in respect of any such day. A person is entitled to a reduced rate or reductions in the rate of illness benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work, where he or she is entitled to reduced wages, salary, or paid sick leave, for those same days, which is less than the rate of illness benefit to which he or she would otherwise be entitled.</p>  <p>There are no provisions under social welfare legislation which set out that a person does not have access to an occupational sick pay scheme in respect of any period of incapacity for which they are receiving illness benefit or enhanced illness benefit. Where an employee has access to an occupational sick pay scheme, scheme rules may require that the employee mandates illness benefit payments to the employer where sick pay has been provided to the employee. This arrangement is a matter between the employer and employee.</p></reply>

The Framework sets out how businesses should operate at five different levels. </p><p>In the first instance, an employer is responsible for determining what work can be done remotely. However, employers must bear in mind that the overarching public health advice is that employees should work remotely where possible. The country is, at present, at Level 5.  In this regard, all employees should work from home unless they are delivering an essential service as listed on <i>www.gov.ie</i>, such an essential health, social care or other essential service and cannot work for home.</p><p>Employers and workers should seek to resolve any matters relating to remote working at a local level through mutual dialogue and engagement. Where this is not possible a dispute may be referred to the State's workplace relations services for mediation or conciliation. The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is providing services on both a face to face and virtual basis. Advice can be obtained from the Information &amp;amp; Customer Service of the WRC at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059 9178990 or from its website <i>www.wrc.ie</i>. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has produced a detailed guidance for both employers and employees in relation to home-working on a temporary basis during COVID-19 restrictions. This guidance will help employers to understand the requirements, and steps to take, when setting up working-from-home arrangements for employees from a health and safety perspective. The guidance is available on-line at<i>www.hsa.ie</i>. </p><p>While the Health and Safety Authority has no role in determining which employees can work from home or not, they, along with a number of State Agencies, carry out compliance inspections with the Work Safely Protocol. Where non-compliance with the Protocol is discovered the HSA can use various mechanisms at its disposal to ensure that the necessary measures are put in place. </p><p>Any worker with concerns about health and safety standards at their place of work can contact the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit (WCU) for detailed advice including advice on compliance with the Work Safely Protocol. The WCU can be contacted by phone at Lo-call 1890289389 (landline) or (01) 6147000 or by email at wcu@hsa.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-14a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011400044#WRA02000"><p>Action Plan for Jobs (APJ), 2018, was the seventh and final in an annual series outlining the Government&rsquo;s joined-up approach to maximising employment across Ireland ensuring that all parts of the country achieve their potential in terms of job creation.  Employment grew by over 300,000 over the lifetime of the Action Plans for Jobs, 2012 to 2018, with job creation in all eight regions. Unemployment fell from a high of 15.9% in 2011 to 5.7% at the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  Against this back drop of almost full employment, the Government introduced Future Jobs Ireland in 2019, which set out a policy shift away from job numbers towards quality jobs to allow for higher living standards, and sustainable jobs, with a focus on maximising labour market participation. Future Jobs sought to further embed a resilient and innovative economy that was adaptable to future challenges and to foster economically, environmentally and socially sustainable growth. This agenda has been largely subsumed into the forthcoming National Economic Plan (NEP), the Government&rsquo;s new medium-term economic plan to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the aftermath of the global Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the  plan will set out a pathway for an inclusive and regionally balanced recovery. While the challenge is great, the government is committed to help people get back to work, be that a return to their old jobs or to avail of new job opportunities that will emerge as the economy transitions. This will be supported through a range of labour market activation measures and skills initiatives and engaging employers. </p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates of employment are produced at NUTS 3 regions.  Due to methodology and sample size considerations, it is not possible to produce reliable county estimates from the LFS.</p>  <p>  Delivering a competitive, resilient and regionally balanced enterprise base will be prioritised in the NEP.  It is critical that the potential for enterprise growth and job creation is facilitated in every region. To achieve this nine Regional Steering Committees that offer a bottom-up perspective on regional needs and opportunities have been established and will drive collaborative responses through nine refreshed Regional Enterprise Plans (REPs) to 2023.  Regional Enterprise Plans are focused on strengthening the ecosystem for job creation in the regions and in so doing will support the realisation of annual enterprise agency and LEO jobs and investment targets.   </p>  <p>Employment will also be supported through regional infrastructure development and measures to leverage remote working including investment in enterprise space and hub infrastructures and provision of co-working and remote working facilities where there are gaps in provision.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-14a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011400044#WRA02300"><p>There are 120 IDA supported companies in the West Region, employing 27,695 people in total.  There are 17 IDA supported companies in County Mayo, employing 4,955 people.</p>  <p>  Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy, Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) cannot be the sole contributor in addressing the challenges facing Ireland&rsquo;s regions &ndash; from Brexit to Covid-19, digital transformation to the climate transition &ndash; but it can have a significant impact in propelling economic recovery and realising more balanced growth. </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, innovative and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational corporations that are at the forefront of the modern economy remains essential to winning FDI. IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations as required by current and prospective clients of both IDA and Enterprise Ireland. A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects. Over the last 5 years, IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations.</p>  <p>  For example, in May 2020 Meissner Filtration Products announced that their new manufacturing facility in Co. Mayo is now operational. Meissner had initially established in an IDA constructed Advanced Manufacturing Building, completed in late 2018.</p>  <p>  Ongoing risk aversion, financing challenges and the uncertainty associated with Covid-19 and Brexit are all likely to continue to result in a lack of commercial property solutions in regional locations. The IDA therefore must continue to intervene where market failure exists to ensure that the necessary property and infrastructure solutions are in place to maintain and attract FDI to regions in line with its strategic objectives and regional targets. In addition to its own property solutions, IDA will also continue to work with commercial property developers and Local Authorities to market other property solutions across all regions where they exist.</p>  <p>  The locations in which IDA will provide property solutions over the lifetime of its new strategy Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 were chosen based on extensive analysis, engagement, review and consultation as well as macroeconomic considerations, existing clusters and available resources. IDA will deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions (ABS) to regional locations and will deliver building solutions in Galway (x2) and Mayo (x1) in the West Region. The national capital investment plans outlined in the new IDA strategy, subject to planning permission and public procurement process, are expected to commence and be delivered within the term of the new strategy at all identified locations.</p></reply>

We will continue to strengthen employment rights and champion the principles of responsible free enterprise and fair competition. </p>  <p>  Future proofing our economy and society for the twin transition to a sustainable low carbon economy and the acceleration of digitalisation is central to our mission. Our relationships internationally are crucial as a small open economy and we will continue to build close and mutually beneficial relationships globally and grow our influence in the European Union.</p>  <p>  To reflect the new focus of my Department, particular in relation to workers&rsquo; rights and employment affairs, we have re-named as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>  <p>  In the second half of 2020, my Department made significant progress in delivering on the wide range of Programme for Government commitments that fall under its remit, with a particular focus on implementing measures to assist businesses with the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit. I have included some of this work below but the full range of initiatives delivered will be reflected in the Department's Annual Report for 2020 which is currently being compiled.</p>  <p>  The &euro;7 billion July Jobs Stimulus outlined a series of measures to boost the economy and provide confidence for employees and employers.</p>  <p>  We launched the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, which provides loans to businesses of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million. We published guidance on returning to work safely during COVID-19 and have finalised a national remote working strategy, which will be published very shortly. </p>  <p>  The Restart Grant and Restart Plus Grant of &euro;650m were specifically provided to ensure that businesses could access grant support to make necessary changes to premises to reopen safely.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme is helping hundreds of businesses to respond to the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability.  </p>  <p>  My Department also ensured that employment permit applications for healthcare workers were prioritised to assist our health services in dealing with the pandemic. </p>  <p>  My Department continued to deliver a wide range of services to businesses and the public against the backdrop of a significantly changed and challenging working environment. At the beginning of the pandemic we put in place a COVID-19 Business Supports Call Centre, which has now been established on a permanent basis as the Department&rsquo;s new Enterprise Information Centre. We continue to provide critical inputs to the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 oversight group.</p>  <p>  My Department has played a major role in preparations for Brexit and has delivered new and revised business schemes and regulatory changes and maintained constant communications with businesses on many important aspects of Brexit. I wrote to all businesses in Ireland to help them get Brexit ready and in late December I announced a &euro;100m Brexit Scheme for the food processing sector.</p>  <p>  Other priorities that my Department delivered included the development of an action plan for insurance reform, progressing employment rights issues, the launch of Call 3 of the Disruptive Technology Innovation Fund.</p>  <p>  I will continue working with the agencies of my Department on their priorities for the year ahead. The Deputy may be aware that in the last week IDA Ireland launched a new four-year strategy and Enterprise Ireland announced its strategic priorities for 2021. </p>  <p>  My legislative priorities include establishing the ODCE as an independent agency, bringing forward anti-ticket touting and reselling legislation and giving more powers to the Competition Authorities to protect consumers and break up cartels.</p>  <p>  In 2021 I plan to progress work on the introduction of a living wage and legislation to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme and reform of the examinership process. </p>  <p>  I will be bringing my Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 to Government shortly, which will outline the high-level goals and actions that will be prioritised in the coming period.</p></reply>

Both documents can be found on <i>www.nsai.ie </i></p><p>I would like to thank retailers and their customers for their efforts at this difficult time.

The model is calibrated using water level data from 2016 to 2019. Then, using this model, the flood map is created with rainfall data from the last 70 years which determines the probability of various flood levels occurring in the future. Current data indicates that the relationship between rainfall and water level at Lough Funshinagh has not altered. While the rainfall in 2020 was above average, remodelling with the inclusion of data from 2020 is only one additional year to the 70 already incorporated. Any alteration to the flood map would be negligible and the current flood map is therefore considered appropriate.</p></reply>

Some of the main deliverables achieved in that timeframe include: </p><p>- The finalisation of the text of Climate Action (Amendment) Bill 2020 and its submission to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>- The establishment of the Climate Action Fund on a statutory basis, through the early enactment of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill. </p><p>- The designation of SEAI as the National Retrofitting Delivery Body.</p><p>- The establishment of a Circular Economy Unit within my Department and the publication of a Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. </p><p>- The publication of the second progress report of the Just Transition Commissioner, the allocation of &euro;108m to an Enhanced Peatlands Rehabilitation Scheme in the Midlands and the approval of the first tranches of funding from the Just Transition Fund.</p><p>- Securing &euro;221.5m for residential and community retrofit programmes in 2021, the highest allocation ever to these programmes. </p><p>- Commencing work on updating the Climate Action Plan to reflect the much higher PfG emissions reduction ambition.</p><p>- Finalised regulations for additional 13 towns under the smoky coal ban. </p><p>- Completed the first Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) auction.</p><p>- Continued to progress the review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050.</p><p>- Implemented revised oil and gas policy to give effect to phasing out of oil and gas exploration in accordance with the Programme for Government.</p><p>- Continued the rollout the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>My Department will continue to progress our Programme for Government commitments in 2021.The overall level of ambition for the Department will be set out in its Statement of Strategy which will be published shortly.</p></reply>

Liquidity support has been made available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p>  <p>  In addition to the general COVID-19 supports the Government has agreed an &euro;80 million funding package specifically for aviation in recognition of the difficult winter faced by the sector and to support the retention of core connectivity. </p>  <p>  The  aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector plays an important supporting role in the wider aviation sector in Ireland supporting airline and airport activity.

The designation of the Ringaskiddy Freeport is still in force.  However, this designation is immaterial in the context of  preparations for Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Port of Cork has advised that since that designation, the use of the Freeport has fallen into abeyance, due to the complex nature of the administrative and other requirements. </p>  <p>  The Port of Cork holds a customs bond in respect of the container compounds, car compounds, transit shed and sufferance wharf at Ringaskiddy and Tivoli. The bond has been approved by Revenue &ldquo;as security for duties and or taxes due on all goods imported, landed delivered to, removed to, deposited, stored, delivered from, removed from or exported&rdquo;. The Port has advised my Department that companies prefer to use this facility which better suits their business needs.</p>  <p>  In terms of preparation for Brexit, since the publication of the report &lsquo;The Implications of Brexit on the Use of the landbridge&rsquo; by the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) in 2018, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department has had very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about this issue since January 2019. We have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they will respond. Significant additional shipping links were added on direct routes to Continental Europe even during the Covid-19 pandemic in Summer 2020, with further improvements and increases in capacity coming on stream at the beginning of this year. As well as Stena doubling their sailings on the Rosslare-Cherbourg route, a new RoRo service from Rosslare to Dunkirk was announced on 27th November 2020 and commenced on 2 January 2020.  DFDS will operate 3 new vessels on the route with a journey time of 24 hours from Rosslare to Dunkerque. The vessels have the capacity to carry around 125 trucks/trailers. This additional capacity and connectivity is a welcome addition to the other new direct services and increased sailing frequencies outlined by the shipping sector over the last number of months. </p>  <p>  Such announcements reinforce that the shipping industry is resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.</p>  <p>  The Port of Cork Company has also regularly reviewed the impact of various forms of Brexit on their activities. The Port of Cork&rsquo;s current RoRo services are directly linked with the EU and are not impacted by Brexit. They comprise of RoPax services operated by Brittany Ferries to the Port of Roscoff (France) from March to October and a ConRo service to the Port of Zebrugge (Belgium) by CLdN for the full year.</p>  <p>  Brittany Ferries have initiated plans for increased passenger and freight capacity on its Cork-Roscoff route by putting a second service in operation in 2021.</p></reply>

The provisions of the Agreement will ensure continuing connectivity with the UK in aviation, road freight, passenger transport and maritime. </p>  <p>  However, in the run up to a potential no-deal Brexit scenario, it had not been anticipated that direct maritime or direct air services by community carriers from Ireland to continental Europe would be affected. Furthermore, had a no-deal arisen, it was expected that the European Commission would introduce a contingency measure in the area of aviation connectivity similar to the measure introduced in 2019 which would have ensured continued connectivity to the UK. </p>  <p>  As such, no significant impacts had been expected for Cork Airport as the required changes had been implemented in relation to the UK's exit from the EU. The situation was similar for The Port of Cork Company in that no significant impacts were expected, as they had regularly reviewed the potential outcomes of Brexit and what impacts these scenarios might have had on their activities. There were no impacts expected as their current RoRo (Roll-on Roll-off) services are directly linked with the EU and as such not impacted by Brexit.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government this year. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the necessary issues, I intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration when legislating.</p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters will remain illegal. </p></reply>

My Department is engaging with the NTA on the report and with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the proposal.</p><p>Increases to the thresholds for the Cycle to Work Scheme were announced with the general threshold increased to &euro;1,250 and a newly introduced threshold of &euro;1,500 for ebikes, while the period between eligible claims has been reduced from 5 to 4 years.</p><p>&euro;3.3m was ring fenced in 2020 to renew and replace life-expired lifts and lifts in poor condition at rail stations, to ensure the reliability and availability of lift access. A major part of this programme was the complete lift renewal in 12 stations in the Dublin Surburban area. </p><p>In response to the urgent requirement to quickly decarbonise the transport sector, and in line with Action 79 of the Climate Action Plan, the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group was established in early 2020. The work of the Group has involved a detailed consideration of the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate EV sales. Drafting of the final report from the Group is at an advanced stage, and I will bring policy recommendations arising from the work of the Group to Government in 2021.</p><p>My Department introduced a new motor tax table to take account of carbon dioxide emission levels based on the Worldwide Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).</p><p>Grant support levels were increased to offer up to &euro;10,000 towards the purchase of an eSmall Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV), with a further &euro;2,500 available to convert the vehicle to a wheelchair accessible model. Available support for the purchase of PHEV eSPSVs was also increased to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new PHEV. The eSPSV Grant Scheme can also be used in conjunction with other incentives for EV drivers, including VRT relief, lower rates of motor tax, and a reduction in road toll charges. &euro;15 million was allocated to support up to 750 taxi and hackney drivers in making the transition to fully electric vehicles through an enhanced EV scrappage scheme. This Scheme is targeted at eligible drivers scrapping older (8 years or more) or high mileage (over 300,000km) vehicles and replacing them with zero-emission electric alternatives.</p><p>The NTA has commenced an engagement with relevant Advisory Committee members and others regarding a re-ignition of the previous outreach and learning plan specific to the needs of people with disabilities to access SPSVs. A research project is underway to learn of the experiences of those users to inform future policy making decisions.</p><p>The report on the future of the Western Rail Corridor was presented to Government in December 2020. The Government was informed of a proposed Strategic Rail Review of the inter-urban and inter-regional rail network taking cognisance of the need for balanced regional development and cross-border connectivity.</p><p>A link to the Programme for Government is available here: <i>  </i></p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, our Programme for Government commits us to a 7% average annual emissions reduction and the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill will, critically, give effect to that commitment by establishing 5-year carbon budgets.</p>  <p>  Emissions reductions in the transport sector in Ireland are being effected through: </p>  <p>  - Significant investment in sustainable mobility - to increase capacity and enhance services in our public transport system as well as fostering more walking and cycling trips; </p>  <p>  - Promoting a strong transition away from fossil fuels to lower emitting alternatives, both in public (bus, coach, taxi and rail vehicles) and private fleets (passenger and commercial); and </p>  <p>  - Sustainably increasing the blend of biofuels in the conventional fuel mix.</p>  <p>  Across the globe, decarbonising the transport sector is challenging, with decarbonisation efforts proving difficult and expensive. Growing travel demand often negates emission mitigation measures and concerns are emerging regarding the slower than anticipated pace of some technological advancements. Despite considerable efforts across all Member States, EU transport emissions are continuing to rise. Urgent, deep and widespread reform is needed as we work towards achieving the European Green Deal ambition of climate neutrality by 2050. In recognition of this, the EU has prioritised several climate-focused transport files to reduce transport&rsquo;s dependence on fossil fuels, to make more alternative choices available, to reflect the environmental impact of transport, and ultimately help reduce emissions. </p>  <p>Over the coming months, my Department will actively engage at EU level on the development of these key files which include the review of CO2   emission standards for cars and vans, the recasting of the  Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, the development of the Euro 7 emissions standards, and consideration of extending Emissions Trading to the Aviation and Maritime sectors. Collectively these files will support more sustainable mobility and ultimately place Europe and Ireland on the right trajectory to achieve our long-term climate goals.</p></reply>

A first round of non-statutory public consultations for DART+ West  concluded last October. Consideration of submissions made is underway and further design development and assessment of options is being undertaken.  The next round of consultation is expected to take place sometime in Q1, 2021. </p>  <p>  DART+ South West, the current Kildare Line, is the next element. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently progressing the options selection process and it is anticipated that a public consultation on the emerging preferred route will be undertaken in Q1 2021.  This will provide an opportunity for all members of the public to comment on the emerging preferred route.</p>  <p>  Separately the Deputy will also be aware of Government's approval last year of the proposed purchase of 41 additional carriages to the ICR fleet, which will increase capacity across both the Maynooth and Kildare Lines, thus benefitting commuters of North Kildare in advance of the delivery of DART+.  </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in the area, I have forwarded the Deputies questions to the Authority for further information on the issues raised.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

There is a need to ensure that transport infrastructure is as resilient as possible and that it can withstand any unforeseen climatic conditions over the next 50 years and well beyond. </p>  <p>  In relation to emissions, the Deputy is likely aware that the European Commission, through its Green Deal, and my Department, through the Climate Action Plan, will be setting binding targets to reduce our emissions by 50% in 2030 and reach climate neutrality by 2050. This will place an obligation upon all stakeholders to embed the type of longer-term perspective the Deputy refers.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that my Department will shortly publish the draft National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland, or NIFTI, for public consultation.  </p>  <p>  NIFTI puts in place a strategic framework to ensure that investment in the transport sector in the coming years and decades aligns with overarching Government policy objectives, such as the spatial targets to 2040 set out in the National Planning Framework and the emissions targets set out in the Climate Action Plan.  As part of the supporting analysis for NIFTI, extensive transport modelling exercises have been conducted to identify where there may be potential gaps in our transport provision in 2040, helping to inform our long-term investment  decisions.  Going forward, new investment in the sector will have to align with the NIFTI Investment Priorities.</p>  <p>  Moreover, under the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes &mdash; the sectorial business case requirements published by my Department &mdash; the benefits of transport projects are typically estimated over a thirty year horizon when cost-benefit analyses are conducted. This ensures that the long-term costs and benefits of a project are considered as part of the investment decision-making process.</p>  <p>  Lastly, my Department is now developing a new Sustainable Mobility Policy for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme as outlined in the Programme for Government &ndash; A Shared Future. The aim is to develop a policy framework that better supports sustainable mobility to provide for increased use of active travel and public transport.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will acknowledge this is a substantive policy area and one which is fundamentally important to this Government&rsquo;s ambition generally. The Department is currently refining its development of a new policy framework to allow for further engagement with stakeholders in the coming months and I look forward to that engagement in due course.</p></reply>

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on 31 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner.  </p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home. </p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions, the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place. This means that, for the time being:  </p><p>- Where an employer takes back possessionof the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period. </p><p>- Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle  , no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use. </p><p>- Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer, etc. </p><p>Where an employee has a car providedby his or her employer and </p><p>1. the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply,</p><p>2. limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken due to the COVID-19 crisis,and</p><p>3. personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the current period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s website will shortly be updated accordingly. </p><p>Due to the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic it is not known how long any COVID-19 restrictions will ultimately remain in place. Revenue will however continue to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters (including the provisions relating to BIK on employer-provided vehicles) and if any further measures are considered necessary in the future, updated guidance will be made available by Revenue in relation to same as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Furthermore, my officials in the Department and representatives of the SBCI are in regular contact with the banks.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are being given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. On 30 November last, the BPFI reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% are not making full repayments.</p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations<i></i>set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review <i></i>was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

With the departure of the UK from the EU, the UK became a 3rd country for the purposes of trade with the EU and therefore customs formalities apply. This includes the payment of customs duties and other taxes where applicable. Customs is an EU competence and applies in all Member States and it is not possible for me to make changes in relation to customs matters insofar as charges and duties and when they are payable. </p>  <p>  However, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for zero rates of duty where rules of origin requirements are met. The detailed rules that relate to each product type, including vehicles, are contained in the agreement. Where those conditions are met, a claim for preferential treatment can be made on the import declaration for the good or product concerned. The Deputy should be aware that relief from duty is possible where a vehicle is of UK origin and can be demonstrated as such in accordance with the relevant procedures for determining the origin of goods. The Deputy will appreciate that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU significantly changes the business environment for a number of sectors and the sale of second-hand cars sourced in the GB is one of those sectors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-14a.161.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011400047#WRD02300"><p>Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.  In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Tax Strategy Group papers across all tax heads were prepared, and a review of Stamp Duty measures such as farm consolidation relief, Consanguinity relief and the residential stamp duty refund scheme was carried out. </p>  <p>On banking matters, a key focus in 2020 was on responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. This consisted of engaging with industry to ensure that loan payment breaks were provided to customers who were facing difficulties making repayments as a consequence of Covid-19. It also consisted of the finalisation and launch of loan schemes to support SMEs, including the &euro;2bn Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and the expansion of the Future Growth Loan Scheme in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SBCI. A number of EU files were progressed and the transposition of both the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD 2) and the 5th Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV) was completed at the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  A review of the Policy Framework for Credit Unions and a review of Resolution and Stabilisation Levies for Credit Unions both commenced in 2020 and will continue in 2021. Legislation to allow for credit unions to convene virtual AGMs was implemented.  A Section 24 review of Home Building Finance Ireland commenced in 2020 and will be progressed this year.</p>  <p>  My Department worked with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General to complete the transposition of the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and the Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Act 2020 was progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  Advancing the new Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda as set out in the Programme for Government is a priority. The Action Plan for Insurance Reform was published in December. Delivery of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda, including implementation of the elements of the Action Plan relevant to my Department, will continue to be prioritised in 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for representing Ireland&rsquo;s interests in the EU budget process. A comprehensive financial package of &euro;1.82tn was agreed by EU leaders in July 2020, which combines the 2021-2027 Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) of &euro;1.074tn, and the &euro;750bn temporary Next Generation EU recovery instrument. The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the key element of the &euro;750bn Next Generation EU plan agreed by the European Council in July. </p>  <p>  In my role as President of the Eurogroup, significant agreement was reached at Eurogroup in November 2020 on progressing reform of the European Stability Mechanism and the early introduction of the Common Backstop to the Single Resolution Fund. Into 2021, delivery on the Eurogroup Work Programme and Euro Summit commitments, in particular a time bound work plan on banking union and discussions on the appropriate fiscal stance, will be amongst my main priorities. </p>  <p>  In order to protect jobs and workers in the context of Covid-19, my Department managed Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the European instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) loan scheme. In the second half of 2020, necessary legislative provisions were put in place at national level and Ireland&rsquo;s SURE loan application was submitted and approved by the EU. Continued management of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the SURE scheme, including finalising the loan drawdown, will remain a priority in 2021.</p>  <p>  To protect Ireland&rsquo;s economic and financial interests in the context of Brexit, my Department was closely involved in the whole-of-government preparation on relevant issues in the EU-UK future relationship, and will continue to strategically engage in international and EU outreach and alliance building to advance our national objectives, including with the UK in the context of the EU-UK Cooperation and Trade Agreement.  </p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, many of the policy initiatives in 2020 will remain a priority in 2021. As well as Budget 2022 and publication of Finance Bill 2021, production of the Stability Programme Update and the Summer Economic Statement are priorities. </p>  <p>  Preparation for reform of the Local Property Tax is on the tax agenda in 2021. In line with the Programme for Government, a Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be established. Implementation of measures will be published in the forthcoming update on Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap, including engagement on EU and OECD proposals in relation to the international taxation framework and the continued transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.</p>  <p>  Legislation on banking issues will include progressing the drafting of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit Firms) Bill 2020, the transposition of the Regulations on European crowdfunding service providers for business, the transposition of the Covered Bonds Directive EU 2019/2162, and a Central Bank (Amendment) Bill to introduce the Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR).</p>  <p>  Priorities in the area of Financial Services will include satisfactory completion of the Industry migration project regarding the Irish settlement system (Central Securities Depository) and development of an Action Plan for 2021 in relation to the Government&rsquo;s multi-year strategy for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector to 2025, Ireland for Finance.</p>  <p>  From an international perspective, my Department will put in place the necessary provisions to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the IMF&rsquo;s New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB) including enabling legislation (subject to Oireachtas approval).</p>  <p>  In relation to climate change, my Department will continue to ensure that economic, taxation and financial sector policy interventions support the Government&rsquo;s climate action agenda including in the implementation of Departmental actions under the Climate Action Plan 2019 and in the drafting of the new Climate Action Plan for 2021. My Department will continue to engage at EU level in the development of sustainable finance and international climate finance in accordance with our policy objectives and will participate in relevant work streams of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action on an ongoing basis throughout 2021. </p></reply>

The PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare type payments and is exempt from USC and PRSI charges. </p>  <p>  Tax is not collected in real-time through the PAYE system.  Instead, liability to tax will be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  This is being done in order to maximise the amount of financial support provided to recipients at a time when they need such support most. </p>  <p>  For 2020, to minimise the end of year tax impact on persons who received payments, Revenue placed them on the &lsquo;week 1/month 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation from 21 June 2020. The &lsquo;week 1/month 1 basis&rsquo; preserves recipients&rsquo; unused tax credits, which can then be offset against any accumulated tax liabilities at year end, including in respect of PUP.  Any additional credits that an employee may have, for example health expenses, may also be used to further reduce the accumulated tax liability.</p>  <p>  In the case of lower income households or those whose income comprises solely of social welfare payments, a liability to tax typically does not arise because the value of social welfare payments received in a tax year are usually lower than the income sheltered by the main income tax credits.  Further, in cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of income tax due may be reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset.   </p>  <p>  Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the PUP.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has also given assurances that if any income tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with PUP recipients to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.  The latter will be achieved by reducing taxpayers' credits for subsequent tax years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

My most recent meeting was with the Chair of NatWest on the 17 December where I emphasised that Ulster Bank is an important part of the Irish banking landscape and I reiterated the importance of timely and direct communication between staff, their representatives and management throughout the review, especially if there are any developments. I outlined that I expected that any decisions arising from the review will be swiftly communicated to staff, customers and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I also met with representatives of Ulster Bank on 21 October. Ulster Bank has confirmed that the strategic review is ongoing and that no decisions have yet been taken. Ulster Bank also confirmed that there is no set timetable for this review and that it is fully aware of the strategically important role that Ulster Bank plays in the provision of financial services to the Irish market.</p>  <p>  I emphasised the importance of Ulster Bank to the Irish financial services market, to the wider economy and to the communities it serves. News of the review is, of course, unsettling for all stakeholders, especially the staff and customers. </p>  <p>  The continued presence of a viable and active Ulster Bank in the Irish market would be the most welcome outcome. Ulster Bank is a significant employer with 2800 employees and has 88 branches across the country. Ulster Bank is also important in terms of providing competition in the Irish retail banking market. However, as the Deputy will be aware, I have no formal role in the commercial decisions of Ulster Bank, these are a matter for the Board and Management of the Bank and its parent company, NatWest.</p>  <p>  In the absence of direct knowledge about NatWest&rsquo;s strategic review of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s operations, I cannot and will not comment or speculate on possible outcomes as there is no basis for such speculation, which would be open to misinterpretation.</p>  <p>  While I will have further engagement with the bank as the review process continues, I would like to emphasise that I have no role in the review or any commercial decisions arising from it.

An Indecon report commissioned by my Department in 2019 concluded that a fully cashless society would not be an appropriate objective for policy makers. The Report is available at the following link, </p><p>If a retailer specifies in advance of a transaction, for example by displaying signs at the till or at the store entrance, that it will only accept payment by a means other than cash, it is not legally obliged to accept cash as the means of payment and can request the use of an alternative instrument such as a credit or debit card. </p><p>My Department supports the work of the European Commission in this area. In September 2020, as part of the EU Digital Finance Package, the European Commission published the Retail Payments Strategy. One of the key aims of the strategy is to maintain access to and acceptance of cash across EU Member States. The strategy recognises the importance of ensuring that there is continued access to cash and that the increased use of digital payment methods does not lead to financial exclusion.</p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.  </p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer.  The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers.  The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free.  In contrast, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum. </p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.  </p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. </p><p>Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax which may be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>Finally, the 2020 Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains several commitments related to working from home, including an examination of the &ldquo;feasibility and merits of changing tax arrangements to encourage more people to work remotely&rdquo;, the responsibility for which falls to my Department.  There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;national remote working strategy&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group was established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand that the group's Report is due to be published shortly.</p></reply>

My Department has been participating in whole of Government preparations for Brexit since before the UK referendum in 2016 and, in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall approach, this work intensified during 2020 ahead of the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  Regarding financial services, my Department has been working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), through the Financial Stability Group, and through the Brexit Contact Group, to limit the impact of key identified risks in the Irish financial system and review progress on readiness planning. This work and engagement has sought to ensure that the sector is adequately prepared, and that financial services firms and market participants have contingency plans in place to cope with the possible effects of Brexit, with as little disruption for consumers, investors and markets as possible. On the basis of its work and engagement across the sector, the Central Bank has been able to assure me that the financial sector is well prepared and resilient enough to manage the changes associated with Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department has been supporting the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; preparations for the customs checks that are now necessary for goods travelling between Ireland and the UK, excluding Northern Ireland. Notwithstanding that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now in place, businesses face a significant level of change due to new customs arrangements. Significant resources have been allocated to this, including intensive stakeholder communications and training, staff recruitment and infrastructure enhancements. Revenue systems are working as expected and Revenue will continue to work closely with individual businesses and trade and business representative bodies to assist them in building their capability as quickly as possible, in order to minimise the impact. Any traders who are experiencing difficulties should seek support in resolving their issues.  Advice and assistance is being provided by Government.</p>  <p>  Much of my Department&rsquo;s preparations are supported by measures contained in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020. These measures deal with areas such as taxation, settlement finality, insurance and customs. The measures seek to protect citizens and consumers, facilitate the sound functioning of key sectors, and ensure our businesses are not disadvantaged after the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  The macroeconomic forecasts underpinning Budget 2021 assumed a disorderly end to the Brexit transition period would occur at end 2020. It was in this context that Budget 2021 provided &euro;340 million in measures to prepare for Brexit, through the continuation of existing measures and new supports for sectors and enterprises likely to be most affected. This comes on top of over &euro;700 million in successive Budgets since 2017. In addition, the Recovery Fund of &euro;3.4 billion will allow specific, targeted measures to be introduced when and where the need arises in response to both Brexit and Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The EU budget&rsquo;s Brexit Adjustment Reserve allocation to Ireland will complement and enhance the comprehensive supports put in place by Budget 2021. The European Commission published the proposal on 25 December 2020, and my and other Government Departments are continuing to make Ireland&rsquo;s case for substantial funding to support affected sectors known to EU partners.</p>  <p>  On the basis that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is now in place, as well as the preparations undertaken in respect of the economy, budgetary strategy and financial services sector, I am satisfied with the steps taken to date to support preparedness and to manage any impact.</p>  <p>  One sector in particular which has evolved as a result of Brexit, and which continues to do so, is the international financial services sector, which has seen firms relocating from the UK and firms looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time.  This follows on from a number of government strategies, the latest iteration of which is &lsquo;Ireland for Finance, that have sought to grow the sector over several decades, and these strategies were in place long before Brexit. The Government and various state agencies continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge through promoting Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a leading specialist financial services centre.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these preparations and evolution within some sectors, given the scale and interconnectedness of Ireland&rsquo;s trading relationship with the UK, Brexit will have a negative impact on our economy but the Government is doing everything possible to manage this.  </p>  <p>  Joint analyses by my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) modelling the macroeconomic impact of Brexit were published in 2016 and 2019. The analyses covered a range of outcomes and possible future relationships between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  The analyses included a limited Free Trade Agreement (FTA) based on zero tariffs and zero quotas on the goods side with very little covered in respect of services. Overall this is broadly in line with the recently concluded new Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU.</p>  <p>  Under this Free Trade Agreement scenario, the research found that the level of GDP would be around 2  per cent lower over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) and around 3 per cent lower over the long-term (i.e. 10 years), compared to a situation where the UK remained in the EU.</p>  <p>  In the context of the research outlined, Budget 2021 was based on the prudent assumption of a disorderly end to the transition period between the EU and the UK. Under this scenario, a decline in GDP of -2 &frac12; per cent was projected for 2021, with growth of 1 &frac34; per cent expected in 2021. This is around three percentage points below a counterfactual scenario, where a trade deal between the EU and UK is reached.    Updated economic forecasts will be published as part of the Stability Programmer Update in April, and this will take into account the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was reached.</p></reply>

The analysis found that the sectors most exposed to both the Covid-19 and &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit shocks appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. While the analysis was based on the assumption of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit, this general conclusion is still applicable today.</p>  <p>  Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK provides for zero-tariffs and zero-quotas for qualifying goods, it will nevertheless introduce trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers. It is also a considerable &lsquo;step-down&rsquo; in terms of services trade relative to the previous EU-UK relationship, which is significant as Ireland exports considerably more services than goods to the UK. Therefore, while the newly formed agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. Thus, it represents a smaller Brexit shock for a broadly similar sectorial mix of Irish firms as under a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  Using this analysis, my Department&rsquo;s Budget 2021 forecasts accounted for the dual impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit on the Irish economy. Crucially, it was assumed that a Covid-19 vaccine would not be widely available before 2022 and that bilateral trade with the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. Under these assumptions, GDP growth of around 1 &frac34; per cent was projected for this year. However, the earlier than anticipated rollout of Covid-19 vaccines means there may now be some upside to the outlook, though the recent re-introduction of Level 5 restrictions will have an offsetting negative effect.

These projections were based on the assumptions that a vaccine for Covid-19 would not be widely available before the end of this year and that bilateral trade between Ireland and the UK would take place on WTO terms from January. </p>  <p>  However, the public health and economic situation has evolved significantly since the Budget forecasts were published. As it stands, there are both material upside and downside risks to the economic outlook for this year. On the upside, the recent Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK is positive for Irish exporters compared to the &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario upon which the Budget forecasts were based, as it will provide for zero-tariffs and zero-quota trade for qualifying EU and UK goods. However, the Agreement also introduces &lsquo;trade frictions&rsquo; in the form of non-tariff barriers, which will increase trade costs. Therefore, while the agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. An earlier than anticipated rollout of vaccines will also improve the economic outlook for this year. </p>  <p>  On the downside, however, the re-introduction of Level 5 restrictions at the beginning of this month will likely have a contractionary effect on the economy. Overall, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as it will depend on many factors, including the speed at which Covid-19 vaccines can be rolled out, the time it takes to suppress the current wave of the virus, and the impact of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU on the economy. </p>  <p>  The government has provided an enormous amount of fiscal support in response to the Covid-19 and Brexit crises. At just under &euro;40 billion, the level of fiscal support made available in 2020 and 2021 has been unprecedented. Using counter-cyclical fiscal policy in this way has been the most appropriate course of action and was made possible only by the prudent management of the public finances in recent years. As the public health situation improves, we will have to move to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory. The Department will publish its medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal forecast with the Stability Programme Update in spring this year setting out the trajectory towards a more sustainable fiscal position.</p></reply>

Also Irish mortgages are also generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income: growing cost inefficiencies have been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;</p>  <p>  - there are lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that a new entrant has recently entered the residential mortgage market and that it is offering fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in February 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in January 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed the Central Bank advises that a recent study by it estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  Nevertheless, I will continue to work with the Central Bank and also engage with lenders to encourage, within a framework which seeks to maintain overall financial stability, greater price and other competition in the mortgage market, both for new and existing borrowers.  It is, therefore, a welcome development that a new residential mortgage lender has recently entered the market and it will be of benefit to new mortgage borrowers and also to borrowers, in particular to borrowers who may still on a standard variable rate with their lender, who may wish to consider switching to a new lender.</p></reply>

In line with this mandate, the Central Bank introduced macroprudential measures for residential mortgage lending in February 2015. The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. </p>  <p>  The mortgage measures are now in place as a permanent feature of the market and are operating in line with their stated objectives of enhancing the resilience of banks and borrowers to future shocks and reducing the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing.  Subject to certain allowances and exemptions, the mortgage measures set particular loan to value and loan to income limits on residential mortgage lending by regulated entities and, as the Deputy will be aware, the loan to value limit for first time buyers is 90 per cent compared to  80 per cent for second and subsequent buyers (and 70 per cent for buy to let mortgages).    </p>  <p>  The mortgage measures are not intended to regulate or directly control the level of house prices per se. However, the 2019 review of the mortgage measures by the Central Bank found that if the measures had not been introduced in 2015, both the level of house prices and the proportion of highly indebted mortgage borrowers would likely have been significantly higher in 2019 than their observed levels, all else being equal. Therefore, as indicated while the objective of the mortgage measures is not to target house prices, this suggests that &ndash; in the absence of the mortgage measures &ndash; affordability pressures for mortgage borrowers would have been even more acute.  Furthermore, the Central Bank indicated that the latest review of the mortgage measures conducted late last year found that they have continued to meet their objectives over the course of 2020.</p></reply>

The salaries that apply to Secretary General posts are as outlined in Circular 12 of 2020 which is available here:</p><p><i></i></p><p>I understand the Deputy is also referring to the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) Retirement Terms which apply to appointments to Secretary General posts and certain equivalent posts in the civil service (e.g. Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Director General of the Office of the Attorney General).</p><p>The terms that apply to appointments to these posts since October 2011 are as follows:</p><p>(i) Newly appointed Secretaries General may at the end of their term of office be offered an alternative appointment in the Civil or Public Service on the same salary, if they were recruited from the Civil or Public Service, on condition that they do not have 40 years&rsquo; service and that they have not reached the applicable minimum pension age. Those recruited from outside the Civil or Public Service will not be made such an offer, but will be covered by paragraph (ii) below.</p><p>(ii) If the person is not offered a post as in paragraph (i) above, and has not reached preserved pension age, he/she may be offered severance of 1 year&rsquo;s salary (or salary to preserved pension age if less), with pension payable on reaching preserved pension age. For those who have reached the applicable minimum pension age, superannuation benefits are payable immediately, with no additional benefits and no severance payment. </p><p>(iii) Where an alternative appointment is offered, as in paragraph (i) above, but is not accepted, no severance is payable, and pension is payable at the applicable minimum pension age, with no additional pension benefits. Similar arrangements apply where a Secretary General is given an alternative appointment and later retires. </p><p>(iv) Pension benefits of Secretaries General who are members of the new Single Pension Scheme will be based on career-average rather than final salary, and no enhancements.</p><p>The terms that applied to appointments prior to the introduction of revised terms in 2011 are as follows:</p><p>(i) Secretaries General may at the end of their term of office be offered an alternative public service post, or a position in an international institution, if the individual is under age 60 on the expiry of their term of office</p><p>(ii) If no alternative post is offered or if the individual is over 60 on the expiry of their term the following may be  provided:</p><p>- Immediate payment of pension and lump sum, without any actuarial reduction</p><p>- Added notional service up to a maximum of 10 years or balance of service to age 65 (subject to a cap) </p><p>- Severance payment of 6 months&rsquo; salary.</p><p>The pension entitlements for those recruited to these positions depend on a range of factors including career history, pay point, date of entry and age of retirement. The value attaching to these terms also will vary from case to case depending on the specific circumstances applying at each retirement. For example, the pension entitlements of an individual who joined the civil service for the first time after 2013 would be based on membership of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme i.e. career average earnings for the calculation of pension benefits depending on years of service, payable from State Pension Age. An individual with no prior service now joining the civil service on foot of a TLAC competition for the position of Secretary General would similarly become members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  </p><p>  ">Tab A</p></reply>

Cross-Government, we are engaged in the development of the National Economic Plan and the Review of the National Development Plan which will also be published this year.  I have also established a Night-time Economy Taskforce to examine ways of enhancing experiences and supporting economic opportunities in our cities and towns which will report this year.  In September, I launched jointly with the Taoiseach, the Future of Media Commission to ensure that Irish society has a well functioning public service media.My Department has also initiated a public consultation on the designation of major events for free to air broadcast to ensure that key cultural, sporting and other events may be enjoyed by all. </p><p>As part of our COVID-19 response, I oversaw the reporting by the Tourism Recovery and Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforces.  These taskforces were established to look at the impact of COVID on these sectors and to map the recovery of the sectors post-pandemic.  I established an oversight group for the delivery of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce report and I am pleased that significant elements of that report have already been delivered with the balance due for delivery in the coming 24 months.  I am also looking at oversight structures for the Arts and Culture Taskforce Report to ensure that the sector is supported beyond the current pandemic and its resilience enhanced in the medium-term. </p><p>My tenure in 2020 saw a number of new programme initiatives including new rounds of the Sports Capital Programme and Sound and Vision with additional funding announced in December 2020.My Department has, despite the challenge of COVID-19, also progressed the language planning process with a number of new language plans approved and the first Gaeltacht Service Town announced by Minister of State Chambers.  2020 also saw the first awards under the Cultural Capital scheme which will offer opportunities for people to engage with the arts and culture across the country, once it is safe to do so.</p><p>This year is an important year for the Decade of Centenaries commemorations programme and, despite the limitations COVID places on us, we continue to deliver on that programme.  I recently announced funding for local authorities which continue to play an important part in reflecting on our history as part of the Decade of Centenaries. </p><p>Internationally, my Department is engaged in implementing actions under Global Ireland, and I recently had the pleasure of announcing the appointment of new cultural officers to enhance our international footprint.  I continue to work as part of the North-South Ministerial Council and note the successful engagement at the last meeting of the Council on the tourism sector, which I chaired, and on the languages sector, chaired by my colleague Minister of State, Jack Chambers T.D..  The ongoing impact of Brexit remains an issue for the Department.  I continue to work as part of the wider Government engagement to mitigate against impacts across our sectors, not least in terms of the development of the National Economic Plan. </p><p>In addition to all of the above, my Department has put in place a number of policy initiatives, grant schemes and programmes to tackle the specific challenges faced by the arts, cultural, tourism and sports sectors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>In 2021, I will continue to progress the policy initiatives established in 2020.  Also, my Department will continue to expand the delivery of our Creative Ireland programme including through the innovative Arts and Ageing initiative with IMMA announced late last year, the wider Creativity in Older People programme and the Creativity in Schools initiatives in partnership with the Department of Education. A further 164 schools will participate in the Creative Schools initiative in 2021. </p><p>Since June 2020, my department has delivered an unprecedented package of supports for those sectors as part of the July Stimulus package and as part of Budget 2021 which saw a package of &euro;1.08bn agreed for my Department.  Over the past months, we have supported some areas worst affected, including tourism, live performances, helping artists to continue to create and we have funded our sporting bodies, helping ensure championships and games still went ahead.  Despite all the challenges, our sectors have also continued to make an important contribution to physical and mental well-being which has been so important in these difficult times.  </p><p>Further details on the work done to date, supports provided and planned are set out in the statement which Minister of State Chambers and I  published on our Department&rsquo;s website on 30th December.</p><p>This provides a mere snapshot of some of the work undertaken by my Department since my arrival in 2020 and is against a backdrop the myriad of challenges presented by COVID-19.  I am currently working with my officials to finalise a new Statement of Strategy for the Department which will align with the Programme for Government, the National Economic Plan and other key Government policies.  It will set the policy, programme and legislative direction for the Department for the coming three years.  I intend to publish the Statement of Strategy shortly. </p></reply>

However I am also considering correspondence received from Deputy Naughten in the past two days.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Geological Survey of Ireland have been monitoring water levels on Lough Funshinagh since 2016, and that they have indicated that the levels are due to rainfall rather than blockage or change in the natural draining system. GSI have found that the rate of drainage during dry periods has been consistent since monitoring and the problem is that the drainage rate, in general, is  unusually slow for a turlough its size.</p>  <p>  While most turloughs empty each summer, Funshinagh is slow to drain, typically every 4-5 years. It is evident that Funshinagh does not get a chance to &lsquo;reset&rsquo; its flood pattern each year. As a consequence, Funshinagh has not drained since before the 2016 flood and is still impacted by this flood. This issue has been further exacerbated by the heavy rainfall in early 2020.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the vegetation, I am advised that the typical species of turloughs include species that occur under water as well as those typical of the water&rsquo;s edge. The SAC is also selected for the EU Habitats Directive Annex I habitat 'Rivers with muddy banks with Chenopodion rubri p.p. and Bidention p.p. vegetation (3270)'.    In 2004 this turlough held one of the largest areas of this habitat in the country.</p></reply>

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, we are concerned by ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders.</p>  <p>  I note with concern reports that the person in question has been tortured and their current whereabouts are unknown. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees as set out in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela rules. </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have raised this case directly with the Bahraini authorities. </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland has raised the human rights issues in Bahrain at the Human Rights Council in the form of national statements through support to EU Statements.</p>  <p>  Ireland also engages on the issue of human rights in Bahrain through the EU. At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions, and the overall human rights situation in the country. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, has also made representations to the Bahraini authorities on human rights issues, including the detention of human rights defenders as well as the conditions of their detention.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.</p></reply>

The trafficking of women, men, girls, and boys, is a grave violation of the human rights of the individuals concerned under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports all action to prevent trafficking. Countering trafficking is a priority for the EU, and the key elements of the EU&rsquo;s multifaceted approach are set out in the 2017 Communication &ldquo;Reporting on the follow-up to the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of trafficking in human beings and identifying further concrete actions&rdquo; (COM/2017).   </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s approach to the problem of trafficking is comprehensive, including prevention, assistance, support and protection for victims, disrupting the criminal business model and untangling the trafficking chain and intensifying coordination within and outside the EU. Each member state contributes to the EU&rsquo;s overall approach through its own domestic legislation and actions. In Ireland, the Department of Justice leads on the issue of trafficking. </p>  <p>  We also welcome measures taken by countries in the Middle East to prevent trafficking. All of the countries of the region, bar Iran, have ratified the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. We also welcome the enactment of domestic laws to prevent and punish trafficking, as well as the establishment of dedicated national committees to combat human trafficking and labour exploitation. Working both through the EU, and in a national capacity, Ireland will continue to fully support these efforts.</p></reply>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs met with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 7 January to discuss developments in relation to Rockall. The skipper of the Northern Celt also contacted my Department and a response has now issued to him, setting out the current position.</p>  <p>  The Government is seeking to address the issues involved, reflecting the long-standing fisheries tradition in the area around Rockall, and has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities on the matter. Taking account of the new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which came into effect from 1 January 2021, contact may now also be required with the European Commission. </p>  <p>  While such engagement continues, the Government has advised Irish vessels operating in the area around Rockall that there remains an increased risk of enforcement action being taken by Scottish fisheries control authorities at present.</p>  <p>  Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall, which is a small uninhabitable granite rock located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and some 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal. Furthermore, Ireland has also never recognised British sovereignty claims over Rockall.</p>  <p>  The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall, and similar rocks and skerries, should have no significance for establishing legal claims to continental shelf or an exclusive economic zone (EEZ). This is a position that Ireland advanced at the UN conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1972 to 1982. This position is one that is fully reflected in the Convention adopted at the end of that Conference.</p></reply>

Ireland supported EU statements which called for a new Electoral Court to be appointed that could offer a guarantee of transparent elections, and a return to constitutional normality so that the rule of law, democratic principles and civil rights in Bolivia would be respected. This position was supported at the time, among others, by the UN Secretary-General.</p>  <p>  A fresh round of elections was initially scheduled for 3 May 2020 and subsequently postponed to 6 September 2020, until the repeat vote ultimately took place on 18 October 2020. These postponements were largely to due public health concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. </p>  <p>  The EU sent an Election Expert Mission (EEM) to Bolivia to monitor the 2020 general elections. Ireland supported this Mission, whose mandate was to assess the conduct of the electoral process in accordance with Bolivia&rsquo;s national and international commitments on democratic elections. The EEM found that the repeat general elections were credible and reflected the free will of the people and that the elections granted a much-needed legitimacy to a new Government and Legislative Assembly. </p>  <p>  Luis Arce of the MAS party won the vote in the first round of elections and an EU statement, released on 23 October 2020, congratulated President Arce on his successful election. Likewise, the OAS also recognised the legitimacy of these subsequent elections and, in particular, noted the civic attitude demonstrated by the Bolivian people in exercising their right to vote and having done so despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the peaceful transfer of power in Bolivia and is committed to working with President Arce and his Government. The President issued a letter of congratulations to President Arce on his election.</p></reply>

During the initial period of the crisis my Department supported the repatriation of more than 8,000 Irish citizens and secured essential PPE for our health workers. We are also supporting the Diaspora who have been effected by the pandemic. My Department has developed strong information flows across Government on global developments which have informed critical decision making. My Department will contribute to economic recovery as we move to the next phase in 2021.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and during 2020 my Department has been working with our European colleagues to assist each other during this time of crisis, and as we rebuild our economies. This work will continue and deepen in 2021 and beyond. </p>  <p>  My Department will work to protect the island of Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit, and as the inextricably linked histories of Ireland and Britain enter a new phase, we will foster enhanced links between our States to protect and strengthen our bilateral relations.</p>  <p>  A key priority of Government is the commitment to work with all communities and traditions on the island of Ireland to build consensus around a shared future. This consensus will be underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement and by absolute respect for the principle of consent. </p>  <p>  Membership of the UN is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and in June 2020, Ireland secured a seat on the UN Security Council, after a highly competitive election, for a two year period 2021/22. At a time of ever-more complex global threats, which have no international boundaries, such as climate change and pandemics, only coordinated international action and collaboration will bring about solutions. This month, as we take up our seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 session, we are strongly committed to playing a highly constructive role which is underpinned by our commitment to peacebuilding, human rights, disarmament, sustainable development and supporting a rules-based international environment. </p>  <p>  Delivering first class consular and passport services to our citizens will remain an essential priority. Our global diaspora remain an integral part of the wider Irish family and my Department will continue to work with them in maintaining and deepening this vital relationship. In November 2020, my Department published a new Diaspora Strategy as part of a series of measures to strengthen our relationship with the diaspora from 2020 to 2025.</p>  <p>  Recognising the significance of the transatlantic relationship between Ireland and the US, we will strengthen our diplomatic, cultural, and economic relationship with the US at all levels in 2021, and will act as a bridge in the transatlantic relationship between the EU and US. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance programme is an essential element of our overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling the country to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world. The Government is committed to reaching our goal of contributing 0.7% of GNI on overseas development cooperation, and our work to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020 we have been able to pivot some additional development support to address the impact of COVID on the most vulnerable in the world and will in 2021 continue this effort to support investment in public health.</p>  <p>  We will provide support for those countries that are poorest and most vulnerable to climate shocks and ensure that climate change is included as a core theme in strategy development where Ireland has a significant development cooperation programme including Small Island Developing States. As a small island nation ourselves, we will lead by example in protecting our oceans and will emphasise climate action as a priority in our multilateral engagement. </p>  <p>  Our Missions abroad are charged with promoting Ireland, identifying new markets and opportunities for Irish business, and protecting and supporting Irish citizens. We will continue to implement the Global Ireland Strategy which includes the commitment to double our global footprint by 2025. In 2021, we are planning to open new Embassies in Morocco, the Philippines and Ukraine and a Consulate General in Manchester, subject to available resources and managing the constraints placed by COVID.  </p>  <p>  My Department will soon publish its new Statement of Strategy for the 2021-2023 period which outlines in more detail the key priorities for the next three years and how we will deliver meaningful outcomes for Irish citizens, at home and abroad, and how we will use and grow our influence around the world.</p></reply>

In relation to our diplomatic presence in Croatia,  there are no plans to open a Consulate General office in Dubrovnik.

In considering any further expansion of the Diplomatic network a range of factors will be taken into account including our national, political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  In October 2019, my predecessor announced a review of the school transport scheme with a view to ensuring funds are being spent in the most effective way  to meet the objectives of the scheme.  Terms of reference and the scope of the review have been drafted and a Steering Group has been established. </p>  <p>  Given the current evolving situation with Covid-19 and the continued restrictions the work of the Steering Group has been delayed. It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government as they relate to school transport, including examining the options to reduce car journeys and assessing how the School Transport Scheme can work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme; examining the options for providing a better value and a better service for students, including and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.  </p></reply>

However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of the investment in special education and the supports which have been put in place, I am also very conscious that there are some parts of the country, including the area referenced, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that NCSE is acutely aware of these concerns and is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and other stakeholders to bring the required additional special education placements on stream.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education and I want to reassure you that the delivery of the necessary additional provision is being progressed as an absolute priority.</p></reply>

These documents have been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 which required all schools to put in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice. My Department has also provided updated specific guidance to advise on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of vulnerable students and those at risk if educational disadvantage during school closures due to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Many schools have already introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning. The guidance sets out approaches that schools can take and my Department will be asking schools to ensure that there is a specific focus on ensure that these pupils are supported. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided significant additional resources to schools to help support the provision of ICT equipment and to prioritise the needs of students that do not otherwise have access to ICT. My Department issued &euro;50m in April 2020 in Digital Strategy ICT grant funding in respect of the 2019-2020 school year, including &euro;10m brought forward. A further &euro;50m issued in December 2020 in respect of the 2020-2021 school year. Schools were advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Services will engage with principals to promote connectedness to schools for children who are at risk of educational disadvantage and there will be direct liaison by education welfare officers to Direct Provision accommodation centres, refuges for families experiencing domestic violence and homeless hubs to ensure students are linked with their schools. </p>  <p>  My Department spends in the region of &euro;125 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million was allocated to schools in the form of a DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimize any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned shortly. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i></i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

Specifically the immediate priorities following my appointment related to the reopening of our schools, the provision of a summer programme for those students with special education needs or at risk of disadvantage and also to complete the Leaving Certificate 2020 calculated grades process. Budget 2021 also continues the programme of major reinvestment in our school system with my Department&rsquo;s allocation being &euro;8.9 billion in 2021, an increase of &euro;410 million or some 5 five per cent on 2020.</p>  <p>  Government supported the re-opening of schools through the Roadmap for the Full Return to School agreed by Cabinet at the end of July and the provision of a financial support package of &euro;437 million. Almost one million students, 4,000 schools and 100,000 members of staff returned to school in accordance with their normal schedule.</p>  <p>  Government has prioritised the continued operation of our schools in a safe and sustainable manner since their return, and Ireland&rsquo;s public health authorities have repeatedly confirmed that our schools are safe environments with very low levels of transmission within schools. </p>  <p>  In September, 60,000 students received calculated grades results. </p>  <p>  In August, I announced a series of changes to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021, to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. The adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. An advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations.</p>  <p>  A significantly expanded Summer Programme 2020 was provided for children with the most complex disabilities. Over 14,000 children participated in the special education summer programmes for children with special educational needs. The programme included a number of strands and options from which parents could choose, involving either in-school, or home-based supports by teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to help to prevent regression among children with SEN. The programme aim supported the child to reintegrate / transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers. </p>  <p>  In Summer 2020, 215 DEIS primary schools ran literacy and numeracy summer camps in 2020, with over 7,000 pupils attending and 72 DEIS post-primary schools ran the week long summer programme in 2020 with over 2,200 students attending. </p>  <p>  Looking forward to delivering on our commitments in 2021, the additional funding in Budget 2021 provides for a lower pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes reducing the primary staffing schedule by one point, to a historically low level of 25:1.</p>  <p>  An additional 1,065 teachers will be hired benefiting our primary, post-primary and special schools and this includes assisting primary schools to retain existing teachers. Provision has also been made for 400 additional teachers for students with special educational needs both in mainstream schools and in special schools. There will also be a further significant increase of almost 1,000 additional special needs assistants. These investments will ensure more than 1,200 new places in special classes. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;15 million will be invested in the school transport system to provide for growing numbers of school children and the requirements of children with special educational needs.  Further supports are being provided as part of the DEIS programme to those schools catering for the highest concentrations of educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  This will be supported by additional funding of &euro;2 million in 2021 and &euro;5 million in a full year and will include a 1 point reduction to the Senior Schools Urban Band 1 staffing schedule.</p>  <p>  The Government committed to commence a free schoolbooks scheme pilot in September 2020. &euro;1 million has been provided for a new pilot which aims to provide free school books to more than 102 primary schools which are part of the DEIS Programme for the 20/21 school year. The pilot will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.</p>  <p>  In total in 2020, &euro;160 million has been provided to schools in Minor Works funding, including &euro;30 million which has been brought forward from 2021. Due to the unprecedented Covid-19 situation, exceptional Minor Works Grant funding was also provided to Post Primary schools. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides an additional &euro;2m in funding is being provided in 2021 to pay Gaeltacht placement grants for two cohorts of students, due to no placements occurring in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 with a further additional &euro;1m is also being provided for the continued implementation of the Gaeltacht education policy.</p>  <p>  I am committed to expanding and enhancing the in-school speech and language pilots to improve the delivery of therapies in schools. Budget 2021 has provided additional funding to expand the School Inclusion Model to two more CHO areas. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 investment includes a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings with a &euro;740 million budget for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;3.5million has also been committed to continue investment in the Creative Ireland and Music Generation programmes. This will bring the overall funding in this area to over &euro;9 million in 2021. In November last I announced &euro;50 million in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Grants for primary and post-primary schools to support the embedding of the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning and to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning using digital technology. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that work is progressing on the full range of commitments in the Programme for Government and further delivery or fulfilment of those commitments is a priority in 2021 and over the term of the Government.  However, my current clear priority is to work with the education partners to have our schools reopen as soon as possible and to ensure continuity in the education of all students.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on a number of occasions before Christmas, with a further meeting planned shortly.The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i></i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;.

This is more than &euro;4 billion larger than the Department's Budget Day allocation for 2020. Much of that additional spending will be required to meet the ongoing costs of the pandemic unemployment payment and other pandemic-related supports.</p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department issued some 12 million payments to more than 800,000 people under the pandemic unemployment payment - the equivalent of processing seven years&rsquo; worth of jobseeker applications in eight months.  The enormous efforts involved by the staff of the Department, undertaken alongside the continuation of other critical work, ensured that vital income support was made available at a time of crisis to those employees and self-employed who were affected by the pandemic. </p>  <p>  However, I am pleased, even in these difficult times, to have also been able to secure almost &euro;300 million for a series of targeted measures . For example, the Carer's Support Grant has increased by &euro;150 to &euro;1850 - its highest ever rate.  An increase of &euro;5 in the Living Alone Allowance was also included in the Budget. This will benefit over 221,700 pensioners and people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Act 2020 also provided  for maintaining the state pension age at 66 years of age as committed in the Programme for Government.  Also, In line with the Programme for Government, I have established an independent Pensions Commission to examine the range of issues associated with the State Pension system.</p></reply>

Early learning and childcare providers have been requested to make every effort to accommodate vulnerable children during this period. </p>  <p>  The levels of uptake of services will be closely monitored by my Department during January and the conditions on children&rsquo;s eligibility to access services during this period will be subject to ongoing review.</p></reply>

The HEA is working with the Sector to help it to benefit from the flexible approach proposed in the new Erasmus programme.  In response to suggestions to the European Commission made over a number of years, shorter duration mobilities and the use of blended modes of participation are now being introduced. These measures will help widen opportunities for learning mobilities in our higher education sector. </p>  <p>  In 2021/2022, students and staff will have the opportunity to undertake a physical mobility to their chosen destination, should the circumstances surrounding international travel and the Covid-19 pandemic permit this. Students can also undertake a blended mobility approach, combining a period of physical mobility with a period of virtual learning. If international travel is not possible, students can do a virtual mobility for the entire duration of their Erasmus experience. </p></reply>

I am committed to delivering on this commitment to audit how domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented, the terms of reference have been agreed and include particular reference to policies and services designed to respond to victims&rsquo; practical needs and data collection and analysis to inform policymaking across the sector.

In addition, any such provision, if advanced, would need to be considered within the appropriate legislative framework. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to putting in place the systems and structures needed to deliver on our commitment to combat domestic abuse and is working on many policy options and comprehensive consideration will be given to the systems, processes and structures on how to best support victims of Domestic Abuse.</p></reply>

As their skills were identified as being required during the COVID-19 response and subject to the needs of each acute hospital, they were offered a temporary 3 month assistant radiographer role following successful completion of their 7 week final year clinical placement. The 3-month period commenced on 18 May 2020. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that across the health and social care disciplines, there could be over 8,000 students on placement in hospital and healthcare settings.  Of this number, around a third are final year students.  The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements vary between the disciplines. These students are not employees and in many cases the nature of the placement can, in the main, be limited to participation in an observing and a learning capacity.</p>  <p>  Uniquely for student nurses and midwives there is, in the final year, a paid salary when they are specifically employed on an internship placement. Student nurses and midwives&rsquo; final year internship placement consists of a continual 36-week rostered clinical placement, including annual leave. The internship placement is a paid placement as the student nurses and midwives take a reduced caseload. During these placements, students are under supervision and are considered as 0.5 WTE of the workforce. In addition, Intern students can be allocated across all shift patterns including nights, weekends and 12-hour days.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives undertaking unpaid supernumerary clinical placement as students are currently in receipt of an allowance. Again, given the unique requirements of these training programmes attendance at many placement sites is required, some of which are at a distance to base training hospital and the current allowance is to contribute to the cost of alternative accommodation / travel.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.</p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services by the end of 2021. Work planned in 2020, including the planned testing of a reformed model of service delivery, was adversely affected due to the impact of COVID-19 on delivery mechanisms for home support and the requirement for the diversion of resources to deal with COVID-19. This has had an impact on the final timeline. </p>  <p>  The successful development of this scheme is an ambitious programme of reform and is a key priority for me and the Minister for Health. In order to accelerate this work, the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that the required resourcing including personnel, governance structures and other requisite resources are scaled up to ensure that significant progress is achieved by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  Within this context funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll out of InterRAI as the standard assessment for care needs in the community, the testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home support services and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. All work throughout 2021 will progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the increased investment in home support services in 2021 will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home care.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. </p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

Vaccination teams working across the country are administering vaccinations seven days a week.</p><p>The National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, which was prepared by the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination, was signed off by Cabinet on 15 December 2020.</p><p>The vaccines will be rolled out in three phases - the initial roll out, a mass ramp-up and open access. The highest priority groups, those over the age of 65 living in long-term care facilities and frontline healthcare workers in direct patient contact, will receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. This is wholly dependent on supply lines and on candidate vaccines obtaining approval. Therefore, it is not possible at this time to determine a timeframe for the full vaccination programme.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Allocation Strategy can be found at:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>   The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan commits to the establishment of the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services by the end of 2021. Work planned in 2020, including the planned testing of a reformed model of service delivery, was adversely affected due to the impact of COVID-19 on delivery mechanisms for home support and the requirement for the diversion of resources to deal with COVID-19.  This has had an impact on the final timeline. </p>  <p>   The successful development of this scheme is an ambitious programme of reform and is a key priority for the Minister for Health.  In order to accelerate this work, the Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that the required resourcing including personnel, governance structures and other requisite resources are scaled up to ensure that significant progress is achieved by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  Within this context funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll out of InterRAI as the standard assessment for care needs in the community, the testing of a reformed model of service delivery for home support services and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  All work throughout 2021 will progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the increased investment in home support services in 2021 will contribute to meeting the Programme for Government commitment to providing equitable access to home care.</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact of the loss of access to care in the UK under the EU CBD scheme for persons resident in Ireland, the Government has agreed to provide for the implementation of a replacement scheme to be available in Northern Ireland only from 1 January 2021. The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

The review report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from the submissions from stakeholders. </p>  <p>  After the publication of this report, Minister Noonan proposed the establishment of a working group to include representatives from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies, Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations and industry stakeholders under an independent chairperson to examine the issues identified during the review. In this respect the working group will address the key issues raised in the report itself, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector. The position of Chair for the Independent Working Group was advertised and the closing date for receipt of the applications was 23rd November 2020. Once the Chair is in place, membership of the working group can be established.</p>  <p>  In addition to these developments, my Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date. It has also recently sought further research be conducted here to explore alternatives to peat based growing media for horticultural production in this area in its latest Research Call for 2021.

I have had regular briefings with my Department&rsquo;s Management Board on priority actions and progress.</p><p>One of the main policy initiatives currently under way is the process to develop a new agrifood strategy to 2030. The agrifood sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of stakeholder-led strategies to guide its development. The Programme for Government has committed to an ambitious blueprint for the industry for the years ahead, adding value sustainably in the agrifood sector into the future, and supporting primary producers and employment in rural Ireland. There is also a commitment to ensure that, in addition to growing international markets and value-added export as a key priority, a strategic focus of the strategy will be on environmental protection, reversing biodiversity decline and developing additional market opportunities for primary producers. A 2030 Strategy Stakeholder Committee, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Tom Arnold, is continuing its work with a view to publishing the strategy later this year. </p><p>My main priorities for 2021 include:</p><p>- managing the outcome of Brexit, particularly the implications of the Agreement for the fisheries sector, and building a new trading relationship for our agrifood sector with Great Britain;</p><p>- representing Irish interests in the current reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and development of Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan;</p><p>- addressing environmental sustainability issues including climate, biodiversity and water quality;</p><p>- continuing to provide appropriate supports to primary producers; and</p><p>- the ongoing development of the agrifood sector generally, including trade, food safety and animal health and welfare issues.</p></reply>

This consultation was carried out through structured public meetings on the islands.  The consultation process had to be temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and to avoid health risks both for the island communities and Departmental officials.</p>  <p>  The consultation process was re-commenced through an on-line format in the final quarter of 2020 and will conclude shortly.  The Department will also consult with other key stakeholders such as Government Departments and Local Authorities through an on-line approach.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, arrangements are being made to convene a meeting in the coming weeks of the Inter-Departmental Committee which was established to oversee the development of the Islands Policy.</p>  <p>  The Committee will review progress to date and consider the main messages which have emerged from the consultation process.  The scope and structure for the drafting of the new policy will also be agreed at that meeting, and the final phases of the consultation process involving discussions with individual Departments will be mapped out.  </p>  <p>  I envisage that the new Islands Policy will be published in the second half of this year.  The policy will be a significant milestone for our offshore islands and will include recommendations to support a cross-Departmental approach to the future development of the islands.</p></reply>

It will have a five year horizon, and will seek to strengthen the resilience of our rural communities and economies, including in response to the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The pandemic has emphasised the interdependence between rural and urban areas and that strong, vibrant rural communities are vital to enhancing our national wellbeing and realising a sustainable and inclusive recovery where no-one is left behind.  </p>  <p>  In developing the new policy, my Department has carried out a wide range of consultations with key stakeholders, including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural groups, young people and the wider public. The insights and views captured through this extensive process have helped to identify the issues that matter most to people living and working in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In addition, further consultation was carried out to ensure that the impact of the COVID pandemic on rural areas has been appropriately considered and will be reflected in the policy.  </p>  <p>  The policy is currently in the final stages of drafting and I hope to bring it to Government for approval shortly, prior to publication.</p></reply>

Amenity Roads are non-public roads leading to important community amenities such as graveyards, beaches and piers. Such roads may not account for more than 25% of the allocation provided to each Local Authority.</p>  <p>  The scheme is specifically provided for in legislation (section 81 of the Local Government Act 2001) and the stipulation with regard to parcels of land and harvesting activity is covered under that Act. The presence or otherwise of residential occupancy on a road does not affect the eligibility of the road once the other conditions are met.</p>  <p>  The 2002 Department of Environment Memo which governed the Scheme was revised in 2020 following consultation with all of the Local Authorities.  It should be noted that the changes introduced on foot of the consultation are those of an administrative nature to make the provisions clearer, to clarify issues where concerns had arisen previously, or to confirm existing practice which may not have been explicitly referenced in the Department of Environment Memo.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the 2002 Memo clearly stated that roads serving only houses or buildings occupied or used by persons not engaged in agriculture did not comply with the conditions of the Scheme. </p>  <p>  Since the scheme was re-launched in 2017, over &euro;58 million has been allocated to Local Authorities for improvements to over 2,300 qualifying roads under the scheme. This funding has made a significant difference to the access provided by these roads for over 10,000 beneficiaries.  </p>  <p>  Recognising the value of the scheme for people living in rural areas, I secured an increase in the allocation for the Local Improvement Scheme in Budget 2021.  Funding for the scheme this year will increase by 5%, to &euro;10.5 million.  </p>  <p>  The conditions pertaining to the scheme are reviewed each year prior to the scheme being launched. The details of the 2021 LIS will be announced in the coming months when I formally launch the scheme. </p></reply>

The development of the policy is at an advanced stage, informed by an extensive consultation process with a wide range of stakeholders including Government Departments, State Agencies, rural stakeholder groups, young people and the wider public. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department held a series of further discussions with key stakeholders to explore the short and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural communities and economies and to identify actions required to assist rural areas to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The insights and views captured through this extensive consultation process have helped to identify the issues that matter to people living and working in rural Ireland. The new Rural Development Policy is currently progressing through the final stages of approval and I hope to publish it in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  My Department is also supporting the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe (the Countryside Council) to develop a new National Outdoor Recreation Strategy. This Strategy will provide a vision and overarching framework for the development of outdoor recreation in Ireland over the coming years. The strategy is expected to be brought to Government during 2021. My Department is also undertaking a range of other initiatives to support the further development of the sector, including through a review of the Walks Scheme and the role played by Rural Recreation Officers in delivering outdoor recreation priorities at a local level. </p>  <p>  The revitalisation of rural town centres, and progressing measures to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages has also been prioritised. My Department is co-chairing a recently established Inter-Departmental Group to progress the Town Centre First approach committed to in the Programme for Government. The group will also review the suggested actions from the independent report of the pilot Town Centre First Initiative delivered by my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department is also actively progressing a range of other policy initiatives in support of rural Ireland such as a review of the REDZ scheme and the CL&Aacute;R programme, including the designation of CL&Aacute;R areas.</p>  <p>  In respect of community development, progress on the implementation of Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland, will be a priority for 2021 and beyond, while my Department will continue to work with local authorities to support the implementation of the objectives and recommendations of the 2019 review of Local Community Development Committees. In addition, my Department has statutory responsibility to support the development of Local Economic and Community Plans (LECP) and will be prioritising this process in 2021. </p>  <p>  The National Volunteering Strategy 2021-2025 was published in December 2020 and comprises high-level strategic objectives and associated actions to support volunteers and their representative organisations. It articulates the values and principles that will guide and shape Government&rsquo;s support for volunteers and volunteering activity over the next five years. The implementation of the actions in the strategy will be a key priority for my Department in 2021. </p>  <p>  The Charities (Amendment) Bill has been identified as key priority in the Programme for Government. It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to progress this Bill in 2021 as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  The development of a Government strategy for philanthropy is another key initiative of my Department. Consultants were appointed in 2020 to provide an overarching view of philanthropy in Ireland and of best practice in the EU. This research, to be submitted to my Department in early 2021, will assist development of a strategy on philanthropy in consultation with stakeholders during 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department has continued to deliver the range of policy measures to support the development of social enterprises in Ireland outlined in the National Social Enterprise Policy. In 2021, this work will focus on building awareness of social enterprise through the development and implementation of an Awareness Strategy, and on improving data collection on the extent of social enterprise in Ireland. This year I plan to commission a census of social enterprise in Ireland that will address the information gap that exists.  A draft concept paper for conducting a census has been circulated to stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to the development and implementation of the above policy measures, further details of the delivery of our supports and programmes in rural Ireland and communities in 2020 will be provided in my Department's Annual Report, to be published later this year.</p></reply>
