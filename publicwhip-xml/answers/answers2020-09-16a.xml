Full details of these supports for business are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>.</p><p>The provision of supports for students who are required to undertake placements in health care settings is not a matter for which my Department has responsibility. The administration of general unemployment supports rests with my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection while the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has responsibility for the administration of the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant.</p><p>I note, however, that on 8 September, the Minister for Health, in responding to a similar question (PQ 22140/20) concerning the financial supports that will be put in place for student nurses who are unable to work whilst on placement, stated that guidance on the resumption of clinical placements was recently issued by the Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE to all Higher Education Institutes and copied to healthcare providers. This guidance included a revised version of the HSE's document, Infection Prevention and Control Requirements for Clinical Placements in HSE facilities in the context of COVID-19. This document, among other things, sets out the requirement for Infection Prevention and Control Training for all students.  It also underlines that clinical placements are an essential part of student&rsquo;s education and training, ensuring that they will continue to receive the breath of clinical experience that they require. </p><p>The Minister indicated that, according to this guidance, students can move from a placement in one setting to a placement in another without an interval of time, provided they complete a COVID-19 Healthcare Worker Relocation Self Risk Assessment prior to commencing in a different location. Similarly, if a student continues part-time work in a healthcare setting during the same period as attending clinical placements, they are required to complete this self-assessment on an ongoing basis so that any need for testing may be identified. The guidance makes it clear that students should not present on clinical placement if they have any symptoms of acute infection. </p><p>The Minister stated that, overall, the guidance facilitates students in completing their education and training and, in doing so, it does not preclude them from working part time so long as they adhere to the infection prevention and control requirements. He confirmed that, in terms of financial supports, there is a travel/accommodation allowance which amounts to &euro;50.79 a week to support those students to access the clinical placements they require.  </p></reply>

Future funding of the Scheme will be considered in the context of the 2021 Estimates.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future - committed to prioritising the development of microgeneration, letting people sell excess power back to the grid by June 2021. The Climate Action Plan also commited to actions to ensure that renewable self-consumers can sell excess electricity they produce back to the grid. Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan commits to the delivery of a framework for micro-generation from renewable technologies including solar photovoltaic (PV), micro-wind, micro-hydro and micro combined heat and power (CHP), whilst ensuring principles of equity, self-consumption and energy efficiency first are incorporated.</p>  <p>  A Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is examining an enabling framework for micro- generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. This work aligns with the Programme for Government and is an integral part of our emerging Photovoltaic Solar Strategy. The proposed support mechanism will be outlined in a public consultation in the coming months. A suitable support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators by 2021 in line with transposition of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001) into Irish law. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of applications received from local authorities I recently announced the grant allocations for Climate Change Adaptation measures under the Government&rsquo;s July Jobs Stimulus Plan. A total of &euro;14.1 million has been allocated to local authorities under the Department&rsquo;s regional and local road maintenance and improvement grant programme for measures related to addressing the impact of climate change on the road network. </p>  <p>  Cork City Council's application for Climate Change works did include a project to repair existing flap valves at the quay wall outfall from the Atlantic Pond at a cost of &euro;60,000. The Climate Change Adaptation programme was oversubscribed and as a result not all schemes applied for received funding. Priority was given to maintenance and improvement works on the regional and local road network in relation to measures addressing the impact of climate change. In this context the proposed works at the Atlantic Pond were not approved for funding.</p>  <p>  Cork City Council received a total allocation of &euro;226,000 under the Climate Change Adaptation measures.</p></reply>

In addition, local authorities funded under my Department&rsquo;s regional and local road maintenance and renewal grant programme were able to apply for funding in relation to climate change adaptation measures.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus measures were intended to be, and announced as, projects capable of delivery this year and appropriate deadlines have been advised to local authorities. Obviously funding to support active travel projects is available as part of our standard investment programmes and my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) work with local authorities across the country in that regard every year.   </p></reply>

Unfortunately, an exception cannot be made to these requirements.</p>  <p>  As part of the learning process, the 6 month rule for first time permit holders is designed to give the learner driver the opportunity to gain the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licensed driver. The more practice and experience a person gets, the better a driver they are likely to become. </p></reply>

It is not simply a case of declaring them no longer illegal and permitting their use on public roads and in public places.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government. This will involve identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. The Government's current legislative priorities are the necessary measures to manage the Covid 19 crisis and to address its social and economic consequences. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently looking at how progress towards the commitment can be made in light of the foregoing.  The question of what further consultations should take place, with whom and how, will be considered, noting that experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment.</p></reply>

Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The EWSS will be administered by Revenue on a 'self-assessment' basis and employers are required to undertake a review on the last day of every month to ensure they continue to meet the aforementioned eligibility criteria. Employers who, following a monthly review, find they no longer qualify must deregister for EWSS through ROS with immediate effect i.e. from the 1st of the following month and cease claiming the subsidy.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that as entry to the EWSS is administered on a self-assessed basis, there have been no refusals of entry to the scheme once an employer has tax clearance and so there are no appeals. Revenue will in the future, based on risk criteria, review eligibility. In that context, employers should retain their evidence/basis for entering and remaining in the scheme.</p></reply>

Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises.  </p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, and a rigorous programme of enforcement action. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation from April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud.  </p>  <p>  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely and with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force, in acting against tobacco, alcohol and fuel crime. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Regarding the movement or importation of goods into Ireland, Revenue implements a risk-based profiling approach which is designed to facilitate the legitimate movement of goods and to secure payment and collection of duty and VAT, as appropriate, while also protecting citizens, trade and the environment. During the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, in order to &ldquo;green route&rdquo; critical legitimate pharmaceutical products and medicines, Revenue has prioritised the processing of declarations relating to these products at ports and airports to ensure their uninterrupted importation and supply. Where compliance risks are identified in any shipment as a result of risk profiling, Revenue take the appropriate action to address the risk including documentary checks, physical inspections and the deployment of Revenue resources including staff, detector dogs and Revenue&rsquo;s mobile scanner. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against cross-Border smuggling and the illicit trade in tobacco, alcohol and fuel products has achieved a considerable level of success. I am also satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s risk profiling regime addresses the ongoing risks posed by smugglers and organised crime gangs and that the cooperation at a national and international level is maximising effectiveness in combatting illegal and criminal activity.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. </p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction. I am advised by Revenue that a submission was received from Early Childhood Ireland who represent childcare workers in 2017, and having considered the submission, Revenue was not in a position to apply a flat rate expense, as the expenses were not wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment. </p>  <p>  Outside of the FRE regime, all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent that such expenses are not reimbursed by the employer. </p></reply>

Abatement represents a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns in this context.</p>  <p>  Section 52(4) of the Single Scheme Act provides for a waiver of abatement, in exceptional circumstances where the position requires a person with particular training and experience  and where that position cannot be filled other than by the employment of the pensioner.</p>  <p>  The exceptional nature of the Covid-19 crisis has required some sectors, including the health sector in particular, to source staff at short notice to address the manpower challenges on the frontline in this crisis.  Temporary waivers of pension abatement have been sought and provided under the legislation in order to facilitate these efforts.  Retired staff have assisted with the filling of critical staffing gaps and increased service demands associated with the challenges caused by the virus. The duration of the current waiver for the health sector in this regard, as the Deputy points out, is valid until the end of September.   </p>  <p>  An application for any proposed extension of a Covid abatement waiver must be made to this Department accompanied by a business case. Such an application would be a matter for the relevant responsible Department in the first instance.  My Department will examine cases made taking account of the particular circumstances on the one hand but also the need to uphold the intent and requirements of the legislation as well as the underlying policy on the other.</p></reply>

Following extensive engineering and environmental analysis, public consultation, and a formal Public Exhibition, the proposed scheme was submitted to the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform for Ministerial Confirmation. <b></b></p><p>The Scheme is currently undergoing assessment by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Confirmation process under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  Further information has been requested by the Minister as part of the environmental impact assessment which he is carrying out on the scheme.  This information is currently being prepared and is expected to be provided to the Minister in the next few weeks.  </p><p>The estimated Total Project Cost of the scheme is &euro;20.5m, based on current design, but is subject to change following the completion of the detailed design and tender process. Once the scheme is Confirmed, the detailed design will be completed and a tender competition held to appoint a works contractor.  It is currently anticipated that construction will commence on the scheme by mid 2021.</p></reply>

While both schemes are administered directly by the local authorities they operate independently with separate funding streams,  the main differences being the type of properties eligible for funding and the level of local authority contribution. DPG funding is provided for adaptations and extensions to existing social housing stock to meet specific needs of the local authority tenants with a 10% contribution required from the local authority, while the Housing Adaptation Grants address specific needs of older people and people with a disability in privately owned homes with a 20% contribution required from the local authority.</p><p>Both schemes involve works that are necessary to address the needs of older people or people with a disability.  This may involve adaptations, such as stair lifts, grabs rails, accessible showers, wet-rooms, ramps, etc., but can also provide funding for more significant adaptations such as extensions, for example in the case of overcrowding, or the installation of a downstairs bedroom or bathroom.  </p><p>In the case of the DPG scheme, it is a matter for individual local authorities to work within their annual funding allocation, assess individual applications and prioritise the works required under the scheme within available funding.  The  Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability scheme provides grant funding to eligible applicants in private houses to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.  These grants include the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People Grant, which are 80% funded by the Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The Scheme is more sharply focused towards lower income households with the greatest needs.  A means test applies to the Scheme in order to achieve fairness and value for money in its operation.</p><p>In 2020 and in line with previous years under the DPG scheme, local authorities including Louth County Council were asked to submit details of its work proposals and related funding requirements for the year.  Following an assessment of the local authority returns, I recently announced the 2020 funding allocations and some &euro;18m is being made available this year, an increase of 19% on 2019 levels.  Details of the funding allocations, which includes funding towards the Improvement Works In Lieu Scheme (IWILs) for some local authorities, are available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>for-the-disabled-persons-grant-scheme-and-the-improvement-works-in-lieu-of-local-authority-housing-scheme/</i>.</p><p>My Department provides 90% funding towards the cost of eligible DPG works per property with the remaining 10% being provided by the local authorities. The local authority can carry out works up to a maximum level of &euro;75,000 per property without the prior approval of the Department; requests for funding in excess of this can be submitted to the Department for consideration on a case by case basis. In 2020, Louth County Council has been allocated &euro;367,408 under the DPG scheme and along with the Council's 10% contribution, means funding of &euro;408,231 this year. Separately in 2020, they have received an additional &euro;83,902 for accrued commitments from 2019.</p></reply>

The Public Weather Service provided by Met &Eacute;ireann prioritises the protection of life and ensuring citizen safety. The service also supports the activities of the citizen and other agencies to mitigate damage to property and reduce disturbance to economic activity and so enhance support for impact-based decision making for weather events.</p>  <p>  Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s main suite of warnings are issued by the duty forecaster between 10am and midday and are updated as necessary as new information becomes available. In general, warnings will not be issued more than 60-hours ahead of the expected adverse weather but advisories on potential hazards are issued up to a week in advance. </p>  <p>  The weather forecast for Tuesday night (1 September) and daytime Wednesday (2 September) was for spells of heavy rain and spot flooding. </p>  <p>  A Status Yellow Rainfall warning was in operation for daytime Wednesday 5am to 5pm for the northwest (issued 4pm Tuesday, 1st). This yellow rainfall warning was extended to Connacht, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan on Wednesday morning valid from 10am to 9pm Wednesday (issued 9am Wednesday, 2nd).</p>  <p>  While the general forecast was for heavy rain and a risk of spot flooding the rain was much heavier than forecast, further south than forecast and also occurred earlier than forecast. The heavy rain was expected to be in the northwest during Wednesday with the cold front whereas it was in the west with the warm front on Tuesday night.</p>  <p>  Intense rainfall in west Galway resulted in the Owenglin River breaking its banks and flooding 17 houses. Rainfall totals of 70mm in a 24hr period were recorded at Connemara national park (CAMP station). The flood was short lived. </p>  <p>  A number of local factors may have contributed to the magnitude of the event including that the river is very flashy and responds quickly to heavy rain, and the backup of water at a small bridge in the town. </p>  <p>  There was a wet end to August, with soils being in a saturated state. This would result in rainfall running directly to the river. </p>  <p>  It is noted that this catchment area does not have any Office of Public Works (OPW) river gauges which could be used to monitor river levels.  As part of the development of the National Flood Forecasting and Warning Service, Met &Eacute;ireann is engaged in a program of fluvial model development, trials of which are expected to begin in Q3 2021. The Owenglin is included in this phase of development. </p>  <p>  Any analysis to establish the reason for the flooding or the impact on the conversion of land use is a matter for the OPW who lead and co-ordinate the implementation of Ireland's National Flood Risk Policy.</p></reply>

We are also in continuing close contact with EU leaders on this matter and the Taoiseach spoke most recently with Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, on 13 September. The Embassy in London also continues to have extensive contact with representatives of the UK Government. </p>  <p>  On 10 September, Ireland also took part in the extraordinary meeting of the EU-UK Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement at senior official level as part of the EU delegation. This meeting was also attended by representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive. At this meeting, the EU and Ireland made very clear to the UK Government our very serious concerns about the UK&rsquo;s Internal Market Bill.  Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic stated after the Joint Committee meeting that, if the Bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an &ldquo;extremely serious violation of the Withdrawal Agreement and of international law&rdquo;.  He called on the UK Government to withdraw by the end of the month those measures from the draft Bill which are in clear breach of substantive provisions of the Protocol.</p>  <p>  We are in regular contact at political and official level with Northern Ireland representatives on a range of issues, including those related to Brexit. I particularly welcome the meeting in plenary format of the North South Ministerial Council which took place on 31 July, the first in over three years. Given the impact that Brexit will have across a range of economic and social sectors and on how we cooperate North South in these sectors and more generally, Ministers discussed the implications of the UK withdrawal at this plenary meeting. The Plenary will be followed by Ministerial meetings across the NSMC&rsquo;s policy sectors in due course.  In July, I also met with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Belfast, as well as with the leaders of the parties, for constructive discussions including on Brexit related issues. I continue to have regular and ongoing contact with party leaders in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In all of our engagements with the UK Government to date, we have made very clear the vital importance of full implementation of the Protocol, as agreed. Its negotiation was lengthy and detailed, and it represents a fair and balanced outcome for all parties, with compromises on all sides.  It is clear that any unilateral departure from the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement is not acceptable. </p>  <p>  Our view is that such a departure could seriously erode and damage political trust in Northern Ireland and between the EU and the UK. It also damages the trust needed to deliver a successful outcome to the Future Relationship negotiations. The Commission has clearly stated that violating the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement would put at risk the ongoing talks. </p>  <p>  We call on the UK Government to step back from this deeply concerning approach and to work now to repair the trust that is needed to successfully and faithfully implement the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. A positive resolution to this issue is in all our interests.</p></reply>

Students will have until 5.00 pm on 16 September to submit an appeal.</p><p>The appeal process will include three stages:</p><p>Stage 1: Checks will be undertaken on the forms completed by the school and that the information was transferred correctly from the forms to the data collection system.</p><p>Stage 2: There will be a review to ensure that the data was correctly received and processed through the systems used in the national standardisation process conducted by the Department. </p><p>Data checks will include a check to ensure that the rank order of the class group for the subject and level taken has been preserved in the standardisation process and that students placed on the same school-estimated mark in the same subject and at the same level taken by the school are conferred with the same calculated mark.</p><p>Stages 1 and 2 will be taken together.</p><p>Stage 3: Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.</p><p>The Independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The Scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered at Stages 1 and 2.  </p><p>Students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p>If following the appeals process students  remain dissatisfied with the outcome, students  will be able to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams. Subject to health advice, these will begin on 16 November. Further details about these exams will be provided by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) at a later stage. Those who sit the examinations  will be credited with the higher subject grade achieved between the Calculated Grade and the written exam. </p></reply>

In all circumstances schools are required to clearly demonstrate their difficulties in implementing necessary control measures and how the provision of additional support will help to overcome those particular difficulties. Schools can contact the Department at reopeningschools@education.gov.ie if they wish to make an application.

In some instances, where adapted education provision is already being provided to other pupils in the school, it may be possible for pupils who have to restrict their movements to avail of that adapted provision. In the event of pupils being required to not attend school because of a partial or full school closure, it is crucial that all schools make every effort to support pupils&rsquo; learning during the closure period. </p><p>The Department of Education has issued guidelines to schools on how to support pupils who are unable to attend school because they are at high risk from Covid-19 .

In some instances, schools where adapted education provision is already being provided by teachers in the school, it may be possible for pupils who are self-isolating to avail of that adapted provision. This decision should be made at local level by each school in the context of the needs and circumstances of their pupils.</p></reply>

The Department had been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Funding has been provided to private transport providers who are contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department to operate the School Transport Scheme services <s>i</s>n order to meet these requirements. </p><p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18<sup>th</sup>August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p><p>The Department has been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p><p>Every effort continues to provide a safe transport service for when schools re-open.  However, if parents decide not to avail of transport services they may request a refund on the cost of their ticket for the 2020/2021 school year. </p><p>For those children who are eligible for transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme and whose parents decide not to use post-primary transport for the 2020/2021 school year, in light of the impact of most recent health advice, the Department will provide a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements.  Parents were asked to inform the Department by Friday the 4<sup>th</sup>of September if they wished to avail of this option. </p><p>Grants will be paid at the end of the school year following receipt of relevant documentation confirming the number of days the child/ren has attended school in the 2020/2021 school year. The grant is based on the distance a family resides from their school of eligibility, with a minimum daily rate of &euro;2.60 and a maximum daily rate of &euro;5.10. Grants are not available to children who are not eligible under the terms of the transport scheme. </p></reply>

The curriculum in second level schools must meet an extensive range of needs in catering for the cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, physical and moral development of students, and in preparing them for the demands of citizenship, lifelong learning and social and economic participation. Key messages arising from evaluations of the curriculum relate to overload, and the need to make more time and space for active learning and the acquisition of core skills.</p>  <p>  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, which is currently mandatory for Junior Cycle students, is focused on promoting the health and well-being of children. Teachers can include CPR/first-aid in their SPHE programme, however, it is not a mandatory component. Personal safety is currently addressed in a variety of ways in the primary and post primary curricula. For example, SPHE aims to develop student&rsquo;s skills for keeping safe and to make students aware of appropriate responses to various threats to personal safety. This provides schools with opportunities to prioritise first aid if they consider this to meet the needs of their students.</p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, the curriculum is made up of a combination of full subjects and short courses.  Short courses are designed for 100 hours of engagement over the three years of Junior Cycle. Some short courses will be designed centrally by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and others by schools themselves or other bodies, using the template provided by the NCCA.  It is therefore open to a school or other body to develop a short course in first aid training, for use in schools.  </p>  <p>  There are also opportunities within Transition Year in which a flexible menu of learning modules can be provided by schools within the context of a framework for the programme set out by the Department. As part of this, it is open to schools to provide first aid training if they wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to engage with community groups and a wide range of stakeholders to provide for extra-curricular learning opportunities such as first-aid training or to give talks to students. It is the policy of this Department not to endorse any products or programmes produced by external parties for use in schools, irrespective of whether these are for commercial purposes or are freely available to schools. It is the responsibility of each individual school to select the materials and resources that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum.  </p></reply>

This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. </p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal. </p><p>The national standardisation process has led to some school estimates staying the same; some being increased; and some being reduced.  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.</p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school. The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools. This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students.</p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available at <i></i>.</p></reply>

These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.</p><p>The Independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The Scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered at Stages 1 and 2.  </p><p>Students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p>If following the appeals process students  remain dissatisfied with the outcome, students  will be able to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams. Subject to health advice, these will begin on 16 November. Further details about these exams will be provided by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) at a later stage.

There are 58 special schools also included in this programme, managed for the Department by HEAnet. </p>  <p>  The primary broadband scheme operates off existing infrastructure on the whole and the providers on the Primary Broadband Framework access this infrastructure to deliver the service to the schools. The Department does not put in place such infrastructure. The policy of my Departments is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The post-primary school referred to by the Deputy has a high speed broadband connection of 100 Mbp/s which is uncontended and symmetrical, meaning this is a dedicated service to the school. Given that this is an uncontended service; the school should have 100Mb/s connectivity. Schools are advised to contact the Broadband service desk In the first instance, in order to rule out any issues with the internal infrastructure of the school, be it the wireless or wired network and also to record their bandwidth upgrade request as appropriate. The Department's dedicated broadband service desk which is managed on its behalf by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education can be contacted by phoning 1800334466.   </p>  <p>  HEAnet is currently conducting an extensive upgrade programme for post primary schools as a result of which some 47% of schools have been upgraded to speeds greater that 200Mbp/s. A further 380 post-primary schools are now due to be upgraded, and on completion of this process, over 80% of schools will have a connection of 200 Mbps/s or higher. The school referred is included in this cohort due for upgrade over the coming school year.</p>  <p>  The delivery of high quality internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department. Good school connectivity is essential for the embedding of technologies in teaching and learning and for the implementation of new subjects like Computer Science. Currently, my Department spends some &euro;13m on the provision of internet connectivity to schools annually.</p></reply>

The Department had been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Funding has been provided to private transport providers who are contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department to operate the School Transport Scheme services <s>i</s>n order to meet these requirements. </p><p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18<sup>th</sup>August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p><p>The Department has been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p><p>Every effort continues to provide a safe transport service for when schools re-open.  However, if parents decide not to avail of transport services they may request a refund on the cost of their ticket for the 2020/2021 school year. </p><p>For those children who are eligible for transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme and whose parents decide not to use post-primary transport for the 2020/2021 school year, in light of the impact of most recent health advice, the Department will provide a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements.  Parents were asked to inform the Department by Friday the 4<sup>th</sup>of September if they wished to avail of this option. </p><p>Grants will be paid at the end of the school year following receipt of relevant documentation confirming the number of days the child/ren has attended school in the 2020/2021 school year. The grant is based on the distance a family resides from their school of eligibility, with a minimum daily rate of &euro;2.60 and a maximum daily rate of &euro;5.10. Grants are not available to children who are not eligible under the terms of the transport scheme. </p></reply>

Ireland has particularly robust laws governing the importation and use of fireworks.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware fireworks are classified into four separate categories, depending on their level of hazard and whether they require specialist knowledge for use.  Category F1 is the least hazardous category and covers party poppers and sparklers, while Category F4 represents the most hazardous. A licence is required to import any category of firework and because Government policy restricts the availability of all hazardous fireworks to the general public, licences to import anything over a F1 category firework will only be granted to professional and competent operators for the purpose of organised displays.</p>  <p>  The penalties provided for in connection with firework related offences are severe.  Under part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 having unlicensed fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply can result in a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. </p>  <p>  There is currently no review of these provisions planned but I would like to reassure the Deputy that my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage in specific and targeted activities at this time of year to promote a message of public safety and compliance with the law. </p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that in addition to the power to make arrests for the possession of unlicensed fireworks provided for by Part 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, a number of strong legislative provisions are available to Garda&iacute; to combat anti-social behaviour more generally and include - </p>  <p>  - the Criminal Damage Act 1991;  </p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; </p>  <p>  - the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and  </p>  <p>  - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p></reply>

A successful mission in March of this year to Lebanon resulted in the selection of about 220 people who are currently awaiting travel to Ireland. </p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the programme was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship. In terms of resettlements, 650 refugees will be resettled this year, 700 next year, 750 in 2022 and 800 in 2023. The arrivals for the first two years will largely comprise of Syrian refugees resident in Jordan and Lebanon, along with a pilot group of Eritrean refugees resident in Ethiopia.  Any decision to amend the existing criteria or expand the current agreement is a matter for the Government and the UNHCR. </p>  <p>  So far in 2020, no resettlements have taken place due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other international restrictions on travel.  It is hoped to resume operations before the end of the current year and the IRPP staff in my Department are currently engaging with international partners to share a collective experience of how best to resume arrivals and the lessons learned to date.  </p></reply>

The period in which Parent&rsquo;s Leave can be taken will also be extended from one year to two years.  This, and related costs, will be considered as part of the Budget 2021 process.  The support is paid at a rate of &euro;245 per week by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children.

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.  </p><p>The Government introduced new regulations for indoor events on 31st August, 2020 [(S.I. 326 of 2020) Health Act 1947 (Section 31a &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 4) Regulations 2020]. The regulations, which state that events being organised indoors may have no more than 6 attendees, apply to social, recreational, exercise, cultural, entertainment and community events.</p><p>Clarification that drug and alcohol support groups were not included under this regulation was subsequently received from NPHET on 4th September.</p><p>I welcome the clarification that addiction support groups are not covered by the regulations governing indoor events. I would advise that support groups proceed with a degree of extra caution, as individuals with addiction problems are more vulnerable to the risk of Covid-19, and put in place strict protective measures.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that restrictions, currently in place in University Maternity Hospital Limerick, have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review</p></reply>

The HSE has worked intensively since the start of the pandemic to put this in place and I would again like to acknowledge the huge work undertaken in this regard across the HSE. </p>  <p>  Capacity has been in place since early summer to test 15,000 people a day/100,000 people per week. The testing and contact tracing operational and resource model has been designed to flex up and down as needed.  In recent weeks we have needed to flex it up significantly as demand has increased. We are testing more people than ever before, with over 71,000 tests completed in the week ending 12th September. The HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this level of demand, including the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing.  </p>  <p>  We had seen improvements in turnaround times over the week ending 7th September.  85% of GP referrals received an appointment the same day or the next day - the median being 0.9 days. The median time from swab to lab result was 29 hours, now down to 26 hours in the last few days. In total, the median end-to-end turnaround time for negative tests in the community setting ranged from 2.0-2.1 days while median end-to-end turnaround time from referral to communication of a positive result was 2.3-2.8 days. I do acknowledge that the system has come under strain in recent weeks, with a very significant increase in demand experience last week which resulted in some delays. There was a record of 13,000 referrals to community testing on Monday last week alone, and demand remained high for the week and into this week. As outlined above, additional capacity has been brought on stream quickly to meet this demand.  </p>  <p>  It is critical that parents and teachers continue to contact their GP if they or their child has any of the symptoms of COVID-19. The impact that the requirement to restrict movements has while waiting for a test and a test result is understood. But it is essential to prevent any further transmission of the virus, protecting other children and teachers in school and the community more generally. </p>  <p>  More generally, the HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out over the coming weeks to ensure that people can access a test quickly and get their result quickly. Transition to the new model is underway and will continue through the Autumn.</p></reply>

Since then, the Authority has taken the lead role in co-ordinating the cross-Government response to checking workplace compliance with the Protocol. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has advised that as part of the cross-Government approach, inspectors from the Environmental Health Service (HSE), the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are also involved in checking compliance against the Protocol. They have also advised that the Authority is continuing to keep under review and reprioritise its inspection resources so that we can maximise numbers available for field inspection to check compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol and also to ensure the Authority&rsquo;s existing legal obligations are met across all of our many mandates. The Health and Safety Authority continues to complete inspections across high risk sectors, checking compliance with occupational safety and health statutory requirements and compliance with the return to work safely protocol. In addition, the Authority&rsquo;s inspectors carry out reactive inspections across all sectors where they have been assigned accidents or complaints, which may include businesses such as pubs and restaurants.</p>  <p>  The number of inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine deployed to monitor whether pubs are adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines is a matter for my colleague the Minster for Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible. In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review.</p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulation's articles.</p><p>In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription. </p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue. </p><p>In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>. </p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022. </p><p>In accordance with existing national legislation, from January 2022 antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and Licenced Merchant's. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to supply them in the future, however, from January 2022 onwards, a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them. </p><p>Livestock based agriculture is critically dependent on the availability of effective veterinary medicines.  Increasing resistance to veterinary medicinal products threatens their availability in the future.  It is imperative to protect the drugs we have available currently as it is not envisaged that any new drugs are imminent.  </p><p>In recognition of the challenges posed to numerous stakeholders by the new rules my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group chaired by the CVO.  Licenced Merchant and Co-Op representative bodies are members of this group. Two meetings have been held to date and a programme of work involving over 30 antiparasitic related projects is currently being developed. This group will examine all the issues with two principal objectives</p><p>- Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p><p>- Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers</p><p>A 5 week Public Consultation process on the Regulations, hosted by the Department, closed in late July with in excess of 100 submissions received. </p><p>My Department is considering these submissions, and is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products. There is a dedicated email address allowing communications on the new Regulation: vetmedregs@agricuIture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

I have demonstrated my commitment to the industry by increasing the budget allocated to Horse Sport Ireland from &euro;2.5m in 2018 to &euro;3m in 2019 and a further &euro;1m increase to &euro;4.0m has been allocated in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to assist in the promotion and development of equine breeding and production systems in the country. This is achieved through working closely with Horse Sport Ireland. The sector has had tremendous successes in the Eventing discipline over many years with the Irish Sport Horse Studbook being first in the world rankings for 22 out of last 25 years.  In recent years there have been major successes for our young horses in the show-jumping discipline in World Studbook championships with these horses excelling at international venues like Lanaken in Belgium. Building on the key principles of good breed improvement programmes and development of breeders to access young horses early and produce them early for their appropriate market, Horse sport Ireland have proposed the National Equine Production Pathway as part of their Strategic Plan. This programme supports horse assessments, health screening, young horse production and educational days for breeders. This is clearly a programme I can support.</p>  <p>  My hope for the sector is for Ireland to be in the top division of the World Breeding Federation of Sport Horse Studbook ranking for show-jumping in 10 &ndash; 5 years, producing horses that fit with market demands, properly produced for that market.  I will continue to work closely with Horse Sport Ireland so that this can be achieved.</p></reply>

In this regard the recently published Brexit Readiness Action Plan confirms that further measures to support affected sectors will be considered over the coming months. I also welcome the Multi-Annual Financial Framework agreement reached in July by Heads of State and Government, which includes a &euro;5 Billion Brexit Adjustment Reserve for those Member States and sectors most affected by Brexit. We will work to ensure that the agri-food sector gets an adequate allocation from that funding.  </p>  <p>  My officials and I are continuing with our Brexit readiness work, within a whole-of-Government effort, to ensure the best possible outcome for the agri-food and fisheries sectors. Over the coming months, this will include increased engagement and more focused communication with stakeholders around readiness for whatever outcome emerges from the ongoing future relationship negotiations. </p>  <p>  Whatever that outcome may be, things will change, and agri-food businesses need to be preparing accordingly.</p></reply>

The agri-food supply chain stretches from rural and coastal areas all across Ireland to the UK, Europe and further to markets in the Americas, Asia and Africa. In 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s food and agri-foods products were exported to over 180 markets worldwide and valued at &euro;14.5 billion, a 63% increase from &euro;8.9 billion in 2010. </p>  <p>  While the sector faces significant challenges such as COVID-19, Brexit, and trade uncertainty in general, environmental concerns, and future CAP and CFP reform; the sector also has many opportunities to develop further and prosper. We have a strong international reputation as a supplier of safe, nutritious and sustainably produced food. International consumers seek out our food and beverage products in what is a very competitive international market. We should be proud of this and work to build and enhance that reputation for the benefit of our farmers, fishers and all other stakeholders within the sector.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of ten-year strategies to guide its development and we have committed in the Programme for Government that this should continue with the preparation of a new strategy to 2030. A Committee of sector stakeholders has been working since late last year on this new strategy. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. </p>  <p>  Last week, I met with the Chair of the Committee to discuss progress and spoke with the Committee members also, and I am satisfied that their work will  make a very important contribution to ensuring the future viability and development of the agri-food sector.  The Programme for Government has committed to publishing the strategy within six months of Government formation. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, work continues under Food Wise 2025, the current strategy for the agri-food sector. Food Wise identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.The implementation process for Food Wise is driven by a High Level Implementation Committee. I look forward to chairing my first meeting of that Committee this week, where the focus will  be on our ongoing response to COVID and Brexit.</p>  <p>  In the meantime I will ensure that my Department continues to assist the Sector through the provision of significant financial support from the CAP, the CFP and National funding.  I will also ensure that its Agencies continue to provide support for research and innovation, for marketing and for investment where this is needed.</p></reply>

I am determined to ensure notwithstanding the challenges facing the agri-food sector, especially in the current context of the Covid 19 pandemic that opportunities for the dairy sector to build on this performance are maximised. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a global leader in the dairy sector in terms of the safety, sustainability and traceability of our dairy production on family farms, of our processing in facilities that range from global household names to niche cottage industries, and on our justified and hard earned reputation for quality. The quality of Irish sourced milk is a key competitive advantage in our promotional effort and allows the Irish dairy sector to compete successfully in demanding international markets.</p>  <p>  Looking at the future prospects for Irish dairying, opportunities for growth in butter, cheese and yogurt are positive and are largely being driven by innovation in new flavours, product varieties, portion sizes and pack formats to meet changing consumer demands. Increased focus on health issues will be a critical factor for the future, and Irish dairy products will be well placed to meet consumer demand for healthy and sustainable food.  </p>  <p>  In terms of environmental performance, Ireland is rated as having the most carbon efficient dairy production per unit of output in the European Union, primarily attributable to our predominantly grass-based systems of production. Ireland&rsquo;s sustainability credentials, verified through Origin Green, are a key point of differentiation from our competitors. However, there is no room for complacency in this regard, and I know that there is a shared ambition from stakeholders in the sector for further improvement. </p>  <p>  The Irish dairy sector makes an important economic contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy, supporting not just Ireland&rsquo;s dairy family farms but also in employment through primary and secondary processing facilities as well as wider ancillary service providers. As Ireland&rsquo;s dairy sector continues to evolve in the coming years, I am confident that the Irish dairy sector will continue to provide economic and employment opportunities across the rural economy.</p></reply>

The Beef Data Genomics Programme, for example, has made a siginficant contribution to improving the overall environmental and economic efficiency of the beef herd. The BEEP-S (2020)  programme records the weaning efficiency of individual suckler cows, and also supports best practice in welfare management.  The Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) supports capital investment in measures such as low emissions slurry spreading equipment, an important part of the Teagasc Marginal Abatement Cost Curve. </p>  <p>  Ireland is rated among the top performing countries in Europe in terms of carbon efficiency per unit of output, for dairy in particular.

The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has played a role in this, since dairy herds, larger herds, and herds which introduce more cattle, are all more at risk of bTB breakdowns. 52% of all bTB reactors in 2019 were in dairy herds, while there were approximately 2.8 million farm-to-farm cattle movements last year.</p><p>These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes.  Cattle can become infected with TB in a number of ways such as  </p><p>- Close contact with other cattle which are infected, including residually infected cattle from previous breakdowns</p><p>- Contact with infected wildlife, such as cattle accessing badger setts and latrines at pasture, or badgers accessing unsecured cattle feed stores within the farmyard</p><p>- Moving infected animals into a previously clear herd;</p><p>- Contact with other infected animals in neighbouring herds, such as across fences;</p><p>- Sharing machinery or facilities between farms </p><p>We know the risks that contribute to increased herd incidence from many years of scientific research. Risks must be addressed both by national policy changes and by actions at farm level.  As we enter into the decade towards 2030 this is a pivotal year for Ireland&rsquo;s bTB Eradication programme and it is critical that, through working in partnership, all stakeholders take the necessary actions to reduce disease transmission, protect herds from new infections, and clear bTB from restricted herds.</p><p>Farmers have the power to reduce the risk of bTB spreading to cattle and can take a number of steps to protect their herd from disease along with protecting themselves from the stress and financial difficulties of a bTB breakdown.

Bord Bia has indicated that half of this growth has come from markets outside Europe. </p>  <p>  Trade missions play a key role in market and trade advancement.  In recent years, successful visits have taken place to Turkey, China, Japan, South Korea, Algeria and Egypt, among others. Increased market access has been achieved with these visits, including through the abolition of the age restriction on beef exports to Japan, through additional beef plant approvals for export to China and through the progression of beef access in South Korea. Destinations are selected strategically and in keeping with the Bord Bia market prioritisation exercise of December 2017. </p>  <p>  The Government's focus on, and commitment to, new market development has been illustrated by its appointment of my colleague, Martin Heydon T.D., as Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task. In addition, my Department's international trade activities are being reorganised and further developed, as we deal with the twin challenges of Brexit and the Covid 19 pandemic. </p></reply>

The Strategy recommends some 70 strategic actions, which my Department is taking forward.</p>  <p>  The Animal Health Surveillance strategy sits within the National Farmed Animal Health Strategy.  The aim of the strategy is to ensure Ireland maintains its international reputation as having a high animal health status whilst improving national on-farm productivity.  State resources and infrastructure are deployed to  enable effective and optimum monitoring and control of existing diseases and to minimise the potential impact for exotic diseases.</p>  <p>  Food products placed on the marketplace are covered by a range of legislation designed to ensure that products supplied to consumers are of the highest safety standards.  My Department plays a part in the enforcement of this legislation along with other Government departments and State Agencies such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and the Health Service Executive. The FSAI is the body responsible for enforcement of regulations governing traceability, labelling and provision of food information to customers.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Authorities is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail. </p></reply>

Following a decline in the average income level in 2018, largely due to extreme weather, there was a recovery in average FFI in 2019. However, this recovery was uneven, with the average FFI concealing differences across the various farm types.</p>  <p>  Family farm income varies considerably by farm system. Dairy farms are consistently the most profitable farms. However, it should be noted that almost all dairy farms are classified as full-time farms, with farms requiring 0.75 of a standard labour input being defined as full-time and those requiring less as part-time. Most cattle farms and the majority of sheep farms are classified as part-time in terms of labour input requirements, even though in many cases the farmers may not have off-farm employment. Around two thirds of all farms are classified as part-time.</p>  <p>  Direct farm payments are a very important part of FFI, with an average payment per farm of &euro;18,452 in 2019, or 77% of the average FFI. There are noticeable differences between farm types; estimates for dairy farms show that the direct payments account for 31% of income, while cattle and sheep farms are very reliant on direct payments and many would be operating at an economic loss without them.</p>  <p>  A significant change in the methodology in the 2012 Teagasc National Farm Survey saw farms below &euro;8,000 of Standard Output (SO) no longer included in the survey sample. Up to 2011 the threshold for inclusion of farms in the survey field had been &euro;4,000. As a result, a straightforward comparison between the 2012 results and those of preceding years could easily lead to an incorrect interpretation of intervening changes. A further small methodology change occurred in 2018 based on data from the 2016 CSO Farm Structure Surveys and results from 2016 and earlier years are not directly comparable.</p>  <p>  However, looking at the results between 2012 and 2019, and bearing in mind the methodology change, FFI has fallen over this period with average FFI down 6%. Dairy farms have seen FFI increase by 35%, while cattle and sheep farms have seen FFI fall by about 20%. Tillage farms have fallen back close to the average of 6% across all farms.</p>  <p>  The CSO&rsquo;s publication, &lsquo;Output Input and Income in Agriculture&rsquo; shows that aggregate farm income or operating surplus has risen over the past decade from &euro;1.8 billion in 2010 to over &euro;3 billion in 2019. Operating surplus is defined and calculated by the CSO by subtracting compensation of employees from farm income accruing from farm output.  The figure is comprised of the operating surplus earned by farmers and that earned by agricultural contractors. It is an estimate of income before deductions for interest payments on borrowed capital, land annuities and rent paid by farmers to landowners for the use of their land. It does not include income from non-farming sources and may not be equated to household income.</p></reply>

A Committee of sectoral stakeholders has been working since late last year on this new strategy. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. </p>  <p>  Last week, I met with the Chair of the Committee to discuss progress and spoke with the Committee members also, and I am satisfied that their work will  make a very important contribution to ensuring the future viability and development of the agri-food sector.  The Programme for Government has committed to publishing the strategy within six months of Government formation. </p>  <p>  The Origin Green programme, which provides proof points of environmental sustainability, from farm level to the processing industry,  can contribute to securing a premium position for Irish food and drink in the market place.  </p>  <p>  In addition, at EU level, the EU Quality Policy aims at protecting the names of specific products to promote their unique characteristics, linked to their geographical origin. Protecting products with a Geographical Indication ensures fair competition for producers and provides consumers with reliable information on the place of production or specific characteristics of a product and can facilitate  increased market value.  My Department will be working to assess all opportunities for possible new Geographic Indication applications for Irish products.</p></reply>

The closure of food service during the lockdown had a severe impact on certain agri-food sectors.  I am satisfied that the wide range of supports provided across Government, and by my Department in particular, have helped to alleviate the worst economic impacts for farmers, fishers and the food and drinks industry. </p>  <p>  With specific regard to artisan producers, my Department provides funding through the LEADER Food Initiative operated by the Department of Community and Rural Development for artisan, small and micro food businesses. Eligible funding includes the renovation and extension of production facilities, the purchasing of processing equipment, as well as support in areas such as market development, competitiveness, and innovation. </p>  <p>   In addition, Bord Bia has been very active in developing some specific supports for small Irish food and drink suppliers impacted by Covid19 to develop their businesses. Some examples include: </p>  <p>  - a series of podcasts / Webinars for businesses</p>  <p>  - in terms of engagement with Irish retailers, a new initiative in collaboration with one retailer, whereby Irish suppliers in challenged sectors (fulfilling certain conditions and screening), will be fast tracked for immediate national listing </p>  <p>  - collaborating with retailers on specific promotions of Irish Quality assurance produce, for example,  farmhouse cheeses, horticulture produce </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the important role that the artisan food sector has played in supplying locally sourced products during these difficult times and I encourage producers to engage directly with LEADER,  Bord Bia and their Local Enterprise Office for the supports that are available.</p></reply>

We have also introduced a single consent system for forestry road planning.</p>  <p>  My Department has a history of continually developing and educating forestry professionals, which is an essential part of improving the quality of applications.  This is borne out by the advice and guidance issued in forestry circulars and supporting documentation.  Forestry professionals are also obliged to attend formal mandatory training sessions, usually held annually, however these are currently on hold during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Department funds the Continuous Professional Development programme run by the Society of Irish Foresters and the Department keeps under continuous review the training needs of professional foresters.</p>  <p>  I recognise, of course, that it is very important that the Mackinnon Review is fully implemented and that is why I am currently examining the appointment of an independent chair to oversee the process.  The intention is that this person will report on the feasibility of implementing the Mackinnon recommendations for us to consider further.  A review of the Forestry Programme Implementation Group is currently underway to enhance representation so that the membership of the Group is best selected to help advise the Minister and the Department on the implementation of the National Programme. </p>  <p>  There is currently a huge amount of activity in forestry, especially on the reform of the planning and appeals processes and the introduction to the House shortly of a Bill to amend the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001.  Nonetheless, I understand that implementation of the Mackinnon Review is also a priority and I expect to be making further announcements on this issue soon. </p></reply>

There is also good cross-Departmental cooperation on banking matters with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and the Department of Finance. In recent years there have been a number of initiatives undertaken, primarily through the publicly-owned Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to address gaps in the market. Currently, liquidity and working capital needs can be addressed through the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and longer-term investment needs by the Future Growth Loan Scheme</p><p>Last week, with my colleagues the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance, I launched the &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the largest of its kind in the history of the state. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to economic activity.  Following discussions early in the pandemic, the banking sector announced a three-month period of flexibility for customers, including provision of payment holidays or emergency working capital facilities. This was subsequently extended to six months and will expire in October. As the recovery begins, many COVID-impacted businesses will require additional liquidity and working capital facilities. The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is designed to incentivise finance providers to continue to support economic activity by providing liquidity and finance agreements to businesses.  The Scheme is targeted towards businesses which have experienced an adverse impact of minimum 15% in actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID 19 and have difficulties in accessing credit. </p><p>The CCGS will provide an 80% State-backed guarantee on bank lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The CRS will be administered for the State by the SBCI and SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks. The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. It will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers, i.e. farmers and fishers.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme supports strategic long-term capital investment by SMEs, farmers and fishers. The Scheme was developed by DAFM and DBEI, in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF). It is being delivered through participating finance providers and made &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. The loans are competitively priced (an initial maximum loan interest rate of 4.5% for loans less than &euro;250,000), are for terms of 8-10 years and support strategic long-term investment. A minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 applies up to a maximum of &euro;3,000,000 per applicant. Considering the needs of Irish farmers, a specific minimum of &euro;50,000 has been secured for them.</p><p>This is a financial product that was previously unavailable in Ireland. The unique characteristic of the Scheme is that loans up to &euro;500,000 are unsecured making it a viable source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Food companies, too, have identified long-term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. The effects of his product will be felt all along the food production chain from primary producer to processor. The Future Growth Loan Scheme has been open for loan eligibility applications through the SBCI website since April 2019. The scheme has been a success with very strong demand for investment loans.  As part of the Government's Covid-19 response, a second tranche of &euro;500 million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector including farmers, was launched on 30<sup>th</sup>July 2020. </p><p>Food business operators can also avail of the Brexit Loan Scheme and COVID19 Working Capital scheme. Further information on any of these loan schemes can be found on the SBCI website (<i>www.sbci.ie</i>).</p></reply>
