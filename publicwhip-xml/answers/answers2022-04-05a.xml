In addition, annual work programmes are published, which will allow for priorities to be updated in light of emerging opportunities and challenges.  Within these work programmes, the 150 overarching measures in the Policy have been broken down into individual actions for delivery.</p><p>The First Progress Report, which was published in February, provides updates on a total of 216 actions contained in the 2021 work programme for delivery right across Government. It should be noted that significant progress has been made to date across actions and implementation is ongoing. In terms of completion, just under 80% of actions to be carried out by the end of 2021 were completed by end year. </p><p>A new work programme for 2022 is currently being finalised in conjunction with Departments and I expect to publish this shortly.  However, I can say that it will demonstrate continued commitment to realising the ambitions of Our Rural Future, including the development of some new actions under the policy.</p><p>Many of the 2022 actions are already underway, and updates on these will be provided in further Progress Reports to be produced every six months, as per the commitment in the Policy. </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the momentum we have established in the first year of <i>Our Rural Future </i>is maintained, and that we can continue to deliver on the Government's commitment to and vision for rural Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-05a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022040500062#WRA01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 81 together.</p><p>As part of <i>Our Rural Future</i>, the Government is committed to ensuring that the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) is funded into the future. The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland. </p><p>The scheme was reintroduced in 2017, following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  Since then, my Department has allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes. These works have benefited over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p><p>I launched the 2021 scheme with an initial budget of &euro;10.5 million. I sourced additional funding last year from savings within my Department's vote, effectively doubling investment to bring the total for 2021 to &euro;21 million.</p><p>I was pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year. I announced the details of the 2022 scheme earlier today, including the details of the individual allocations to each county this year. These details will be available in the accompanying written reply to the Deputies and are available on my Department's website. </p><p>I am sure this investment will be warmly welcomed.</p><p>I will keep the position in respect to the availability  of further top-up funding under review. </p><p>I have also recently written again to my colleague, Minister Eamon Ryan, T.D., to explore whether funding may be available from the Department of Transport to support the scheme.  I believe a cross-Government approach might reap dividends in dealing with the backlog of applications on hand and I will continue to keep all options open in this regard. <table>    <tr>       <th>COUNTY</th>       <th>2022 LIS ALLOCATION</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>&euro;371,140</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>&euro;582,690</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>&euro;879,099</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>&euro;716,560</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>&euro;958,831</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>&euro;704,030</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>&euro;390,790</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>&euro;485,970</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>&euro;340,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>&euro;351,880</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>&euro;380,760</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>&euro;456,990</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>&euro;358,030</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>&euro;644,070</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>&euro;92,910</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>&euro;358,320</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>&euro;431,760</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>&euro;384,390</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The aim of the webinar was to provide as much information as possible to stakeholders on the national response and encourage and support co-ordination of responses being provided by stakeholders, while also seeking to ensure complementarity with relevant national and local government initiatives and provide central Department contact points for issues and queries. </p>  <p>  New Community Response Fora are also being repurposed in each local authority area. These will enable all those involved at a local level to work together to support the integration of Ukrainian refugees. The role of each Forum will be to coordinate the community-led response in the provision of assistance and support to Ukrainian refugees as they are accommodated around the country. </p>  <p>  Ukrainian arrivals in to the country who are seeking accommodation are being accommodated through the International Protection Accommodation Service.  My Department will continue to liaise with them and offer any assistance we can &ndash; this is a fluid situation which will require a flexible approach. </p>  <p>  The response to COVID-19 showed what we can achieve by working together: national government, local government, and community, voluntary and local development sectors. My Department is coordinating with all our stakeholders, including Local Development Companies, LCDCs, Volunteer Centres, Community Volunteers, and Public Participation Networks, to maximise the effectiveness of the response.</p></reply>

Work on the policy is underway and my Department has now completed bilateral meetings with all relevant Government Departments. These bilateral meetings have provided an opportunity for detailed discussion of the issues raised by island communities and for Departments to assess how they might help address the various issues raised.</p>  <p>  A number of islands have requested that a consultation meeting be held in person on the island in order for the community to have an opportunity to have an input into the policy.  Due to Covid-19 it was not possible for officials to visit islands and these islands did not wish to engage with on-line meetings.  The Department has now agreed to these meetings and I understand that they will be held after Easter.</p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Islands, participating Departments reviewed progress on the policy development and agreed the next steps to be taken. It was agreed that the various Departments would submit a list of action points that they could undertake to further enhance the future development and sustainability of communities on our offshore islands. </p>  <p>  Work has begun on an initial draft of the policy document and I understand that, based on the development work to date, a draft is expected to be ready for my consideration by the middle of this year.</p></reply>

This represents a whole of Government policy and aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres.  It contains 33 actions, which will give our towns the tools and resources required to become viable, vibrant and attractive places to live, work, and socialise.</p>  <p>  The policy is underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), Cro&iacute; Conaithe (Towns) Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS).</p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme prioritises the renovation of derelict and vacant buildings in our rural towns and villages, with a view to bringing these buildings back into use as remote working hubs, multi-purpose community spaces, and/or for residential occupancy. I increased the maximum grant available through the Scheme last year to &euro;500,000 and I will be announcing the details of the 2022 scheme shortly.</p>  <p>  The RRDF is also now open for applications until the 29th April 2022 for Category One projects i.e. those that have full planning and other consents in place and are ready to commence at the date of application. This call has a strong focus on supporting projects that will assist in revitalising our rural towns and villages through planned, sustainable regeneration and development including addressing vacancy and the re-use of heritage and other existing buildings. </p>  <p>  Neither of these scheme funds projects located in metropolitan areas. Supports for such areas are available through the URDF operated by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

We set out our priorities for the Taskforce in 2022 and beyond, and we made it clear that the   new Taskforce will be expected to tackle some of the more complex and longer-term issues that are standing in the way of better mobile and fixed connectivity.</p>  <p>  On foot of that meeting, Minister of State Smyth and I tasked our officials with engaging with all Taskforce members bilaterally to produce a proposed work programme for 2022, to include multi-year actions. These actions will, by their nature, require multiple bodies to work together in cooperation in order to resolve them.</p>  <p>  To date, senior officials from our two departments have met with 11 organisations, including representatives of industry, local and central government. These meetings have resulted in a draft work programme that draws together multiple members working on shared actions to deliver  real, lasting impacts on the way we roll-out communications infrastructure in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The date for the next meeting of the Taskforce has been provisionally set for the end of April. At this meeting we will finalise the terms of reference and work programme for the Taskforce.

It will support Town Teams to develop their own Town Centre First Plans to chart the future direction of their towns and to address issues of vacancy and dereliction. Some 26 towns have already been allocated funding of &euro;100,000 to produce their Town Centre First Plans, including Skibbereen in Cork. Additional towns in Cork and across the country will be supported to also develop plans as the policy is rolled out.</p><p>The implementation of the actions in these plans will be underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), the Cro&iacute; Conaithe (Towns) Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. This will include funding through these schemes to address the regeneration of vacant and derelict buildings as identified in the Town Centre First plans. </p><p>The local Town Team drawn from local community and business representatives will work with local stakeholders to progress drafting of the plans and to identify challenges, actions and integrated responses across a number of key themes </p><p>The policy also includes funding for new Town Regeneration Officers, who will support Town Teams and local stakeholders to implement Town Centre First, tackle vacancy and dereliction challenges, and bring vibrancy back into our town centres. </p></reply>

This is a key element not just of national policies, such as the National Planning Framework, but also in the achievement of sectoral strategies, for example the rural development policy, Our Rural Future and Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, a five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) have been established in all local authority areas to bring about a more integrated approach to local and community development including on our islands and in our coastal areas. They provide a local forum where strategic, multi-agency approaches are implemented. LCDCs bring together representatives from the community, local government, State agencies and local development bodies to develop and agree coordinated responses to locally agreed priorities. Local Economic and Community Plans are used by LCDCs to facilitate a more joined-up approach. These plans are being implemented across the country with local authorities and LCDCs now positioned as key drivers of local economic and community development.</p>  <p>  It is important that we continue to support the LCDC structures as the primary vehicle for collaboration between all national public service providers at local level. For example, LCDCs and the Local Economic and Community Plans (LECP) provide a governance, planning and evidence based framework for the co-ordination and management of local funding including EU supported community-led local development funding to 2027. The Public Participation Network (PPN) also augments the LCDC and Local Authority supports for community led projects around the country.</p>  <p>  In relation to energy generation projects, the Climate Action Plan 2021 sets a clear goal of having at least 500 MW renewables delivered through local community-based projects. These projects will be delivered through the dedicated Community category in the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) as well as through the forthcoming Microgeneration &amp;amp; Small-Scale Generation schemes. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, through the SEAI, has provided initial seed funding of &euro;200k to support the establishment of the Community Enabling Framework under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). A further &euro;2m in capital funding has been allocated to support the development of Community projects in 2022. The funding allocation this year will allow SEAI to rollout a trusted advisory service and enabling grants that are vital supports to enable the growth of the nascent community renewable electricity generation sector. </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Clean Energy for EU Islands initiative, our rural island communities can be part of the clean energy transition of the more than 2,200 inhabited European islands. We also currently have 12 of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore islands as member communities across the Sustainable Energy Communities Network.</p></reply>

With the &euro;70 million already provided for 2021 and 2022 under the Transitional LEADER Programme, a total of &euro;250 million will be made available for the 2021 - 2027 period, thus maintaining the level of funding provided for the 2014-2020 programming period. </p>  <p>  The draft CAP Strategic Plan, which includes LEADER, was submitted to the EU Commission by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the end of December 2021. This is in line with the timelines set by the EU Commission. </p>  <p>  The process of negotiating and agreeing the plan with the EU Commission has thus commenced.  The timeline for implementation of the new LEADER Programme is closely linked to this process.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, my officials will continue to work closely with colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the EU Commission over the coming months with a view to obtaining approval for the CAP Strategic Plan, as a matter of priority.  </p>  <p>  Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023-2027 are underway and my officials are also engaging with stakeholders in this regard.  Decisions relating to all aspects of the programme including the distribution of funding at county level, will form part of the new programme design phase.</p>  <p>  The ongoing engagement and consultation combined with the funding allocation ensures that the LEADER programme from 2023 will continue to support and further develop our rural communities and businesses.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department has offered every flexibility to Local Development Companies, freeing around 600 Community Development Workers to help support arrivals from Ukraine into their locality. In addition, organisations supported under the Community Services Programme can include Ukrainian arrivals in the target groups for their services. In some cases, exceptional additional funding for staff resources is being provided by my Department to organisations providing volunteer support in frontline reception hubs.</p><p>My Department has committed to meeting regularly with key national stakeholders from the Community and Voluntary sector and recently hosted an information webinar attended by over 160 participants from organisations involved in the Ukraine response effort. The webinar provided information, disseminated key messages and encouraged communication and co-ordination.</p><p>I recognise that the capacity, willingness and expertise exists at local level to co-ordinate responses, signpost services, and link voluntary and statutory efforts. Huge efforts were made by volunteers during the pandemic, and dedicated volunteers across the country are already working again to help people from Ukraine arriving in Ireland. Government is working to ensure that local capacity, resources and knowledge are brought to bear on the overall humanitarian response and will work closely with Local Authorities to ensure a well-co-ordinated and seamless approach.  </p><p>Building on structures developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Response Fora are being repurposed in each local authority area. The role of each Forum will be to coordinate the community-led response in the provision of assistance and support to Ukrainian refugees as they are accommodated around the country.  </p><p>In this regard, my Department, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has prepared a Community Response Framework to guide that work. It sets out a national template for arrangements to be put in place in each area to enable all involved at a local level to work together to support the integration of Ukrainian refugees to our communities, under the stewardship of the local authorities. </p><p>Local Community Development Committees<b></b>(LCDCs) are strategically well-placed to assist with the local responses, linking in with state bodies represented on the LCDCs and with other local authority services and initiatives. In this regard, both the Chair and the Chief Officer of the LCDC are members of the relevant Community Response Forum.  </p><p>Public Participation Networks<b></b>(PPNs) in many local authority areas are serving as networking and information hubs for community and local member groups in their area. PPNs are providing information and resources on how people can assist or donate aid, and coordinating information from those responding to the crisis.</p><p>Our volunteer support programme, which includes Volunteer Ireland and the network of volunteer centres, is heavily engaged in sourcing volunteers to address the many requests for specific volunteer roles emerging across the country.  These include reception centres, provision of basic supplies, integration services, access to information, etc. The Community Volunteers pilot programme is also providing a way for local communities to offer support to those in need. Developed based on lessons learned about volunteering during COVID-19, the programme is funded by my Department, coordinated by Volunteer Ireland and Volunteer Centres, and supported by the Local Authority in each area. </p><p>The response to COVID-19 showed what we can achieve by working together: national government, local government, and community, voluntary and local development sectors. My Department is coordinating with all our stakeholders, including LCDCs, Volunteer Centres, Community Volunteers, and Public Participation Networks, to maximise the effectiveness of the response. </p></reply>

I would encourage potential applicants to engage with their local authority or LEADER Local Action Group to discuss the investment programme that is most suitable to their needs. </p><p>As regards the specific project referred to by the Deputy, the CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding under a number of different measures for small-scale infrastructural projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population over a defined period. Applications are currently being accepted via local authorities for funding up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for  community facilities, including car parking,  under Measure 1 of the CL&Aacute;R programme. However, I understand that the location referred to by the Deputy may not be located in a CL&Aacute;R area.</p><p>The 2022 Outdoor Recreation Scheme was launched on 18<sup>th</sup>February last and provides funding to support access to outdoor infrastructure. Funding for car park access may be considered under that scheme where it improves access to recreational infrastructure and where it is part of the wider development of the linked outdoor amenity.</p><p>Funding may also be available through the LEADER Programme for the type of project referred to by the Deputy.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. </p><p>Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes, including Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation.  This theme focuses on driving continued local economic development, including diversification of the rural economy, and the creation of employment opportunities for the local community. </p><p>In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant LAG, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups</i>.</p></reply>

These facilities have been onboarded to connectedhubs.ie, the shared online platform that handles bookings and payments for member hubs and their users.</p>  <p>  It is expected that, in time, the National Hub Network and the connectedhubs.ie platform will include more than 400 facilities. </p>  <p>  I have been clear throughout my tenure as Minister for Rural and Community Development that balanced regional development, sustainable and thriving communities, and indeed the wider national economy will all benefit from workers and employers embracing the remote working revolution.</p>  <p>  At this stage of the development of the hub sector, particularly in rural areas, there is still a strong focus on the individual remote worker. Pricing plans are constructed with affordability for the worker in mind and bookings are, in general, made by the individual.</p>  <p>  However, and as the Deputy will be aware, there are significant opportunities for employers of all sizes to leverage the National Hub Network directly. More workers than ever are expressing a preference for remote work and more employers, noting the strong professional performance of so many remote workers, see their own interests reflected in the those of their employees.</p>  <p>  The connectedhubs.ie team have for some time been developing a corporate service to engage with and support corporate clients interested in using our nationwide network to accommodate their employees, but also to gain access to the vast pool of talent that Ireland has to offer, whether those talented people live in our cities, towns, villages or rural parishes.</p>  <p>  I will monitor the development of the corporate service with interest, as I believe this represents another great step forward for the National hub Network. </p></reply>

The need for reliable, high-speed broadband has been recognised by the government and, accordingly, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) has commenced.</p><p>Notwithstanding delivery of the NBP, which is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, my department has, through a number of schemes and initiatives, supported the development of Smart Communities, Villages, Towns and Cities for several years. </p><p>For example, the Broadband Connection Point (BCP) initiative is, by its very nature, a Smart Community programme of significant scale. When complete, 300 publicly accessible and broadband-enabled community hubs will make onsite connectivity available to enable a range of initiatives in areas such as the delivery of  digital skills training and remote work and study.</p><p>Since early 2020, officials at my department have been investigating opportunities to further develop the smart offering at BCPs and have, to date, rolled out eHealth, arts and culture, digital skills training (including for older people) and remote work / study pilot programmes. These pilots will be expanded and scaled up over 2022 and into 2023.</p><p>The Smart Villages concept underlines the need for a greater focus on empowering communities at local level if rural areas are to thrive in the coming decades. </p><p>The LEADER Programme is one of the key interventions of <i>Our Rural Future</i>, the Government&rsquo;s policy for rural development. Given its reach and history, the LEADER programme can play an essential part in the Smart Villages concept in terms of mobilising and empowering local communities, in developing their capacity to design and implement community-led initiatives and promoting innovation and experimentation.</p><p>Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023-2027 are well underway and support for the development of Smart Village Strategies will be strongly encouraged as part of that programme.</p></reply>

I would encourage potential applicants to engage with their local authority or LEADER Local Action Group to discuss the investment programme that is most suitable to their needs. </p><p>More details would be required in respect of the specific project referred to by the Deputy before indicating the most appropriate investment programme. The CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding under a number of different measures for small-scale infrastructural projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population over a defined period. Applications are currently being accepted via Local Authorities for funding up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for  community facilities, including car parking,  under Measure 1 of the CL&Aacute;R programme. However, I understand that the location referred to by the Deputy may not be located in a CL&Aacute;R area.</p><p>The 2022 Outdoor Recreation Scheme was launched on 18<sup>th</sup>February last and provides funding to support access to outdoor infrastructure. Funding for car park access may be considered under that scheme where it improves access to recreational infrastructure and where it is part of the wider development of the linked outdoor amenity.</p><p>Funding may also be available through the LEADER Programme for the type of project referred to by the Deputy.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. </p><p>Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes, including Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation.  This theme focuses on driving continued local economic development, including diversification of the rural economy, and the creation of employment opportunities for the local community. </p><p>In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant LAG, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups</i>.</p></reply>

This publications represents a major new policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres.  It contains 33 actions which will give our towns the tools and resources they need to become more viable and attractive places in which to live, work, socialise and run a business.</p><p>  Action 3 of the new policy refers to the provision of Town Regeneration Officers (TROs). The TROs will be appointed in local authorities to drive the implementation of Town Centre First (TCF). TROs will be crucial to managing the implementation of the policy at a local level and ensuring the development and implementation of TCF plans. The role of the Town Regeneration Officers is outlined in the policy.</p><p>I was delighted to secure additional funding of &euro;2 million for these posts in Budget 2022. As a result, it is envisaged that a TRO will be appointed in local authority areas across the country.  </p><p>A National Town Centre First Office will drive the delivery of many of the recommendations outlined in the policy and support the co-ordinated roll-out of the policy by local authorities, Town Regeneration Officers, and Town Teams.  </p><p>My Department has agreed the structure and funding for the national implementation office and the Town Regeneration Officers with local authorities. The first step is the recruitment of the head of the National Implementation Office which will be progressed shortly, and the recruitment of Town Regeneration Officers will follow on from this in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

My Department and Pobal are monitoring the situation closely, particularly as it affects the CSP Programme.  Organisations funded under the CSP can include Ukrainians who have fled the war among the target groups for their services.  Arriving Ukrainians are provided with an immediate right to work, and so are entitled to obtain a PPS number and to take up vacancies in CSP funded organisations.</p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department has in recent days received a request for additional staffing in one of our CSP supported organisations in County Clare, which is currently being used as the central community hub to co-ordinate the local response.  I am pleased to advise that an additional Full Time Equivalent position in the organisation was approved by my Department on 29 March with a start date of 1st April, to support the response effort.  </p>  <p>  Any further requests for such support under the CSP Programme will be dealt with by my Department on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

My Department recognises that for this to be achieved it is essential that investment is made in the maintenance and upgrading of island infrastructure. To this end, I have increased the allocation available for capital works on the islands from &euro;2.64m in 2021 to &euro;4.64m for 2022.</p>  <p>  This will enable me to approve an expanded works programme this year, which will include the annual programme for Minor Capital Works on the offshore islands, co-funded by the relevant Local Authorities.  So far this year, I have approved works to the value of &euro;2.09m on non-county roads on Donegal islands. </p>  <p>  Additionally, island projects set out in Project Ireland 2040 are being progressed this year.  These include three major harbour projects, namely: improvement works to piers on Inis O&iacute;rr and Inis Me&aacute;in in Co. Galway and at Machaire Rabhartaigh serving Oile&aacute;n Thoraigh in Donegal.

SICAP aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality.  It is delivered in both rural and urban areas by Local Development Companies (LDCs) who work with the most disadvantaged and the hardest to reach in communities.</p>  <p>  SICAP staff have valuable experience and knowledge of supporting migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in their areas and will continue to ensure the emerging needs of their locality are responded to also.  Every flexibility is being offered by the Department in relation to SICAP and approximately 600 Community Development Workers have been tasked with prioritising work around supporting people arriving from the Ukraine into their locality.</p></reply>

The Programme is an investment in local leaders to help them address the challenges experienced in those areas.</p>  <p>  The P-BLD programme will strengthen the capacity of those already working hard to improve the quality of community life in Darndale and Drogheda. The programme will encourage and facilitate collaboration that will positively impact the culture of the area. It will build new community leaders to empower communities to address the issues they face. This approach will make a lasting impact and bring forward the solutions required.</p>  <p>  I hope that the Place Based Leadership pilot programme will open up new perspectives and possibilities and provide opportunities for mutual learning that can be built upon and expanded to other communities in Ireland going forward once we see the results from Darndale and Drogheda.</p></reply>

The regime is designed to accommodate the arrival of non-EEA nationals to fill skills and labour gaps for the benefit of our economy, in the short to medium term. The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of Ireland, the European Union and other EEA states. Employment opportunities which arise in Ireland should, in the main, be offered to suitably skilled Irish and other EEA nationals and should only be offered to non-EEA nationals who possess those skills and where no suitable candidate emerges from within the EEA to fill the vacancy. This policy fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU.</p><p>In order to safeguard the employment opportunities of Irish/EEA nationals, restrictions exist on the granting of employment permits. Among the safeguards is the requirement for an employer to satisfy a Labour Market Needs Test before a General Employment Permit can be issued to a non-EEA national. Further protections in place include proof of an employer/employee relationship and minimum remuneration levels. Employment permit holders have exactly the same protections under Irish employment law as any other worker in the State.</p><p>Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce. In order to meet this demand, the Government is committed to building and retaining a highly skilled workforce to serve the needs of the economy and has introduced a series of initiatives focused on workforce upskilling of new workforce entrants and those made redundant by the pandemic.</p><p>My Department and I recognise the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has implemented an action plan to reduce processing times built up over the past year.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.  Internal processes have been streamlined, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of permits awaiting processing. </p><p>Waiting time for Critical Skills Employment Permits (CSEPs) have been more than halved in the past seven weeks.  The Department plans to maintain processing times for all CSEP applications at approximately its current level for all of Q2, on the assumption that demand remains at current levels.  </p><p>All flexible resources have now been redeployed to other permit types with a view to expediting the reduction in the current backlog of applications in Q2. Further progress will be delivered after the completion of approximately 3,000 one-off applications we are currently processing for the meat and horticulture sector, which should take approximately six weeks to clear, in addition to normal processing workload.  The Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times from mid-May, with waiting times considerably reduced by end Q2.  </p><p>In Q3 the Department will continue to drive down waiting times across all permit types.</p><p>As of 4 April 2022, my Department are processing applications received on the following dates for the specific types of applications:</p><p><b>Critical Skills Employment Permit Applications</b></p><p>Trusted  Partner21 February 2022</p><p>Standard07 February 2022</p><p><b>New Applications (All other permit types excluding Critical Skills Employment Permits)</b></p><p>Trusted Partner29 November 2021</p><p>Standard08 November 2021</p><p><b>Renewal Applications (All renewable permit types included)</b></p><p>Trusted Partner01 December 2021</p><p>Standard05 November 2021</p></reply>

Ireland was the 19th country in the world to publish such a plan in response to the endorsement of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by the Human Rights Council in 2011.</p>  <p>  The implementation of this whole-of-government plan was overseen by an implementation group comprised of representatives of Government, civil society and business. Both the plan itself and the programme for Government committed to a review of implementation. This review was undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with stakeholders during 2021. The Government noted the finalised review at its meeting on 3 December 2021. It is published on the Department of Foreign Affairs' website: www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/ourrolepolicies/humanrights/Review-of-Implementation-of-National-Plan-on-Business-and-Human-Rights-2017-2020---for-website.docx.pdf</p>  <p>  As regards a further National Plan, my Department will actively contribute to this important project, including in respect of Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence in line with the Programme for Government reference with regard to whether there is a need for greater emphasis on mandatory due diligence.  </p>  <p>   On the 23rd of February the European Commission published a proposal for a directive on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDD). The proposal sets out obligations for companies regarding adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising from their operations, their subsidiaries and their value chains. Among the provisions is a requirement for relevant companies to integrate due diligence into their corporate policies and put in place a specific due diligence policy in relation to human rights, climate change &amp;amp; environmental issues. The due diligence measures must identify actual or potential adverse impacts and prevent/mitigate such impacts within a company&rsquo;s own operations or those of their subsidiaries and from within their value chains.  My Department is currently examining this proposal in detail. </p></reply>

Building on the National Remote Work Strategy launched in January 2021, my Department fully supports the move to a blended working environment. In finalising our longer-term policy, and transitioning to it, my Department will be informed by the Civil Service Blended Working Policy Framework published on 31 March 2021. This will inform the development of the Blended Working policy for my Department, which will be finalised and issued within the coming weeks. </p><p>In this context, my Department will build upon the learnings from our successful experience of remote and blended working in the past two years. We developed a ConnEcTEd Teams Action Plan ConnEcTEd Teams Action Plan - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie) during this period and it supports our teams in a blended working environment.</p><p>The &lsquo;ConnEcTEd Teams&rsquo; programme established behaviours that support effective remote/ blended working for teams.  The programme targets five key areas:</p><p>1. Maintaining team/ organisation-wide connectedness and trust;</p><p>2. Ensuring effective and efficient information flows;</p><p>3. Enabling continued on-the-job training and coaching activities;</p><p>4. Facilitating remote collaboration and innovation; and</p><p>5. Supporting employee wellbeing.</p><p>Our remote working options will evolve over time as we pilot blended working options including working from home two or three days per week while ensuring business needs are met. We will continue to survey staff and to work with our leaders, staff and unions to implement the optimum blended working policy that best serves my Departments delivery for the citizen.</p></reply>

They also provide increased possibilities for Member States to support regions facing transition or structural challenges. </p><p>The RAGs require each Member State to have a map identifying areas where Regional Investment Aid can be granted.  The RAGs also set out the criteria that Member States must use to identify areas on a Regional Aid Map eligible for regional investment aid. </p><p>The Commission approved Ireland's Regional Aid Map on 22 March 2022 and the Map identifies areas eligible for regional investment aid. The Map also establishes the maximum aid intensities that apply in eligible area. Aid intensity is the maximum amount of State aid that can be granted per enterprise, expressed as a percentage of eligible investment costs.</p><p>The aid intensity rate that applies to an area on the Map depends on the criterion of the RAGs under which that area has been approved for inclusion on the Map.  The base rate of assistance for an area eligible under Criterion 1, of the relevant section of the Guidelines, is 15%.  The base rate of assistance for an area eligible under Criterion 5 or Criterion 3 (islands), is 10%. The base rate applies to all enterprises, irrespective of their size. The maximum aid intensities can be  increased by 10% for investments made by medium-sized enterprises and by 20% for investments made by small enterprises, for their initial investments with eligible costs up to &euro;50 million. </p><p>While the Map identifies areas where Regional Aid can be granted, inclusion of an area on the Regional Aid Map does not in itself mean that Aid will be granted in that area, furthermore, an enterprise operating in an excluded area can still be supported in a number of other of ways by Enterprise Ireland, IDA or other State Agencies or Departments. </p><p>A full

They are required, as each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.    The National Peatlands Strategy acknowled`ges the tradition of burning peat in Ireland, but also recognises that the associated emissions to the air contain a range of pollutants. Research undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency also demonstrates that the contribution of peat to air pollution levels is significant.</p>  <p>  Turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands, and while measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, these traditions will be respected. </p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to accommodate those with rights to harvest sod peat, no ban on its cutting or burning will be introduced, but a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the placing on the market, sale or distribution of sod peat. This approach will facilitate those with turbary rights to continue to cut and burn sod peat for their own domestic purposes, while also reducing the use of sod peat in urban areas.</p>  <p>  As such, persons who have turbary rights will continue to be permitted to extract peat to heat their own dwelling, but will not be permitted to place it on the market for sale or distribution to others.</p></reply>

Under the scheme 50% grant funding was available for homes that carried out retrofit to an A rating and replaced fossil fuel heating systems with heat pumps and renewables, with 95% support available for people at risk of energy poverty. The pilot has provided detailed information on the types of upgrades and technologies suited to particular homes, the costs associated with deeper retrofit, post works energy performance of homes retrofitted as well as customer and contractor experience of undertaking deeper retrofit projects. A key requirement of the scheme was that applications came from service providers rather than homeowners and involved at least 5 homes.</p><p>The following table gives the details of the number of projects approved, the total and average funding per project, the number of homes on each project approved and the average grant per home. They are assigned to the year in which the grant agreement was issued to the applicant. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of projects approved</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total funding approved (&euro; million)</td>       <td>1.55</td>       <td>7.98</td>       <td>13.61</td>       <td>2.73</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average approved funding per project (&euro; million)</td>       <td>0.26</td>       <td>0.22</td>       <td>0.24</td>       <td>0.21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of homes on approved projects</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>252</td>       <td>275</td>       <td>66</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Average Grant per Home</td>       <td>&euro;36,900</td>       <td>&euro;31,700</td>       <td>&euro;49,500</td>       <td>&euro;41,400</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The deadline for applications to be submitted was 19th July 2019.

Approximately 4,700 PFAS have been identified to date. PFAS are a significant concern in the EU and globally as they can cause long-lasting environmental damage and potentially adverse health impacts. In this regard it is important that they are strongly regulated at an EU level.</p><p>  In recent years the EU has set in place a number of new strategies aimed at strengthening chemical legislation to ensure that chemicals are safe and sustainable by design, and that the most hazardous chemicals are banned. My Department actively engages with the EU in this matter and strongly supports the initiatives being undertaken. These include:</p><p>  - EU Farm to Fork Strategy: The Commission is currently revising food contact materials legislation to improve food safety and public health. The proposed revisions are to be published by end of 2022.</p><p>  - EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability: The Commission is proposing a set of actions to address the use of, and contamination with, PFAS. This includes a commitment to address PFAS with a group approach and to only allow PFAS use where it is proven to be essential.</p><p>  In addition, the European Commission-led review of the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive is ongoing and may include measures to deal with compostable packaging, mandating recycled content in plastic packaging, reuse, prevention, and restricting substances of concern. I am committed to ensuring that Ireland plays a lead role in pushing the level of ambition for proposals emerging from the review.</p></reply>

A consultation on the MAC assessment regime for Relevant Projects concluded in February.   Alongside this, my Department have been drafting the terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). Owing to the specific scale and nature of typical offshore wind farms, dedicated auctions are initially required to support the longer-term potential of this technology in Ireland. At least three offshore RESS auctions are currently planned for this decade. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the new framework for Ireland&rsquo;s future offshore electricity transmission system, approved last year, provides for offshore grid development, operation and ownership.

SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance. The Scheme offers unprecedented grant levels, increased from around 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump.</p><p>Following Government approval, the SEAI registration portal opened for companies to apply to be a One-Stop-Shop. The SEAI advise that there are currently 19 companies going through the important registration process, at various stages, from Stage 1 pre-qualification review to having their OSS appointment letter issued. Of these, there are two One Stop Shops registered by the SEAI with one  more to follow imminently. Once the One Stop Shops are registered, homeowners will then be able to make applications for upgrades under the new Scheme. </p><p>The One Stop Shop approach is one of a number of SEAI Schemes available for home energy upgrades, details of which can be found on their website at </p><p>Homeowners can familiarise themselves with the scheme details on SEAI&rsquo;s One Stop Shop webpage covering the benefits of engaging a One Stop Shop, the ranges of services on offer and the grant amounts available per energy efficiency measures installed: www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/</p><p>SEAI have also produced a homeowner guide to advise homeowners through the various steps to completing a whole house upgrade under the One Stop Shop Service:</p><p>National_Home_Energy_Upgrade_Scheme_-_Homeowner_Guide[1].pdf</p><p>SEAI are focused on engaging organisations capable of professionally managing all aspects of a One Stop Shop service.

While all options are on the table as we strive to achieve carbon neutrality, we must ensure that if policies like this are pursued that they are evidence based and that viable alternatives exist for people to continue to make their journeys.</p><p>My Department published the <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study </i>in December 2021, pursuant to Action 81 of the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>2019. The purpose of the Study is to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city. The Study focused on addressing four main challenges facing our cities: decarbonisation, air quality, congestion, and, improving the overall urban environment. The Study is evidence-based using insight from an extensive international best practice review, national and local stakeholder engagement and supported by detailed qualitative (Phase 1) and quantitative (Phase 2) appraisal - available to view at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c6571-five-cities-demand-management-study/</p><p>While the Study has identified that the introduction of congestion charges can prove effective, the Study also found that there are a variety of alternative measures that can be pursued with greater effect. The three priority measures that have been recommended for implementation across the five cities are:</p><p>- Develop and embed the concept of 15-minute neighbourhoods through national and local plans and strategies, providing resources to incentivise their implementation through national funding/grants schemes.</p><p>- Enhance delivery of the National Planning Framework.</p><p>- Public Parking Controls.</p><p>Importantly, the Study has also made clear that there is no single solution to tackling the challenges facing our urban environments. Utilising an integrated Travel Demand Management approach to policy development, planning and delivery of our land use and transport systems will be fundamental to addressing these challenges in the coming years.</p><p>In line with our Climate Action Plan commitments, my Department, NTA and the Regional Assemblies are engaging to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025.</p></reply>

It has put in place a number of measures including establishing a senior management taskforce; stepping up recruitment efforts; redeployment of staff where possible; opening security lanes on a 24/7 basis, and enhancing communications with passengers. These measures made a difference last weekend compared to the previous weekend, with 95% of passengers through T2 on Sunday having a queue time of less than 30 minutes and 100% less than 45 minutes. The comparable passenger queue times for T1 on Sunday were 82% at less than 30 minutes and 97% at less than 45 minutes. </p>  <p>  The company has also recruited over 100 new security staff recently and this should assist in the alleviation of the excessive queue times over the coming period.

The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years, to facilitate the expansion of EVs in the Irish car fleet. A draft national charging infrastructure strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  As regards existing apartment buildings and shared residences, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.</p>  <p>  As per the draft strategy, for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective. This will provide a safe and accessible charging solution for those without access to a driveway without the use of cable extensions running from the house over pathways. </p>  <p>  Residential charge points should replicate the home charging pattern of charging vehicles at night, during off peak periods, and at a low cost. There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point. It is expected that as growing numbers of people switch to EVs, there will be an increased need for publicly accessible and on-street charge points to cater for those who do not have access to private off-street parking and cannot charge their vehicles at home.</p>  <p>  Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland will provide co-funding to support Local Authorities in developing local area network plans for EV infrastructure, comprising both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points at Local Authority facilities.Local Authorities will then be able to apply for funding from a new Residential Charging Scheme which will replace the Public Points Scheme.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 945,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required. </p>  <p>  A positive policy environment has been fostered with a generous suite of financial and taxation incentives in place for those buying an EV as well as an extensive publicly accessible recharging infrastructure network. Presently, there are approximately 53,000 EVs on Irish roads; a significant step-up is required if Ireland is to achieve its Climate Action Plan EV target.  </p>  <p>  The former Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 175,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. In its report, published in September, the Group noted that the UK second hand EV market is an important vector for vehicles entering the Irish fleet. </p>  <p>  Matters relating to VRT &amp;amp; other taxation is a matter for which my colleague the Minister for Finance has primary responsibility, and with whom I will be engaging on these issues in preparation for Budget 2023. </p>  <p>  I am supportive of all appropriate and proportionate supports for the EV industry providing momentum towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s emission reduction commitment.</p></reply>

I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence. </p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for certain other operators also, fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. </p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods. </p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 9 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum. </p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. </p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 9 March, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. However, we must accept that it will not be possible to insulate citizens and businesses from the full impact of these fuel price increases.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. </p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost of waiving public transport fees for persons in possession of a student leap card. to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

In that regard I very much welcomed his announcement of increased thresholds under the existing scheme as part of the July Stimulus 2020. The increases are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government in relation to the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to &ldquo;widening the eligibility of the Bike to Work scheme&rdquo;. To advance this commitment, my department in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development, introduced a pilot initiative last year for the provision of high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes for those on low incomes and the most marginalised and disadvantaged, via the Community Services Programme.</p>  <p>  Funding of up to &euro;1m per annum (&euro;3m in total) will be provided by my Department over a three-year period and will be made available through the Community Services Programme, which is managed by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development. Five applicants were approved for support under this pilot initiative.</p>  <p>  Bikes will get a second life, and the people building them will provide a vital service in their communities with these pilot projects. This scheme keeps valuable materials in circulation, builds local expertise, and will shorten the turnaround time for those who have come to rely on the bicycle as a convenient way of getting around.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend eligibility for the scheme further. </p></reply>

The core body of the Merchant Shipping Acts date from 1894 and consists of over 30 subsequent Merchant Shipping Acts. The Irish Maritime Directorate (IMD), made up of the Divisions across the maritime sector within my Department, has a wide-ranging legislative work programme in place covering safety standards for vessels, ship and port security, seafarer certification, seafarer working conditions, marine environment/ship-source pollution prevention, marine recreational safety matters, ports and harbours, and marine casualty investigation. The legislative programme is informed by international, European and domestic requirements. The implementation of this legislative programme is framed over a ten-year period 2019-2029.</p><p>In February 2021, the IMD published its Strategy for the period 2021-2025. The Strategy includes key actions to be undertaken in relation to our legislative work programme having regard to a new analysis of requirements at domestic, international and EU level and emerging requirements for the maritime sector.  As part of our action plan under the IMD Strategy, officials from my Department received training from the Law Reform Commission and produced a finalised consolidated text of the Merchant Shipping Acts , and .  This is the first step towards the progression of a future modern Merchant Shipping (Consolidation) Bill scheduled for development in the latter part of the legislative work programme.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.</p><p>The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p><p>While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p><p>Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  </p><p>This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p><p>The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p><p>Regarding the issue of whether the public can make a formal submission to the consultation process in relation to the primary medical certificates, the methods and structure of the NDIS working group is a matter for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. I cannot comment on any possible changes in advance of proposals arising from the review.</p><p>The number of applications for a Primary Medical Certificate and the number of those that were successful are a matter for the HSE. The below table outlines the number of appeals heard by the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and of those, that were successful and unsuccessful for the years 2019 &ndash; 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022*</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New appeals</td>       <td>684</td>       <td>204</td>       <td>382</td>       <td>102</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Appeals Assessed</td>       <td>424</td>       <td>116</td>       <td>148</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Successful Appeals</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of Unsuccessful Appeals</td>       <td>415</td>       <td>112</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*2022 figures are to 28.03.2022</p><p>**307 appeals outstanding at 01/2019***Appeal hearings were lower than usual for 2020 due to both public health considerations and the Supreme Court Case in June 2020.

The Programme for Government 2020 outlined a commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The need to make significant emissions reductions in the transport sector is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s policy around Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and Motor Tax; the systems are designed to facilitate the uptake of EVs and to address the increasingly harmful environmental and public health effects of vehicle emissions.</p>  <p>  The VRT system has been modified in recent Budgets to strengthen the environmental rationale of the regime, and is structured to provide a reduced rate for EVs of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%. The &euro;5,000 VRT relief for electric cars and vans were due to end on 31st December 2021 but was extended for two years in Finance Act 2021 to end in 2023. As the rate of VRT charged for EVs is already very low, many purchased in the next two years will pay no VRT at all.</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I legislated for a carbon dioxide-based benefit-in-kind (BIK) regime for company cars from 1/1/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new carbon dioxide emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with carbon dioxide-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p>  <p>  The current &euro;50,000 BIK exemption was extended in Finance Act 2021 with a tapering mechanism that represents a value for money consideration.  This forms part of a broader series of generous measures including the preferential rates of VRT and Motor Tax, the VRT relief, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging; all designed to achieve national targets around EV uptake. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this Government continues to provide a generous set of supports to achieve national targets regarding the transition to low and zero emission vehicles.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exempt from VAT.  </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may be interested to know about the margin scheme, which is used as a means of reducing the possibility of double taxation on the sale of second-hand goods. It operates by allowing taxable dealers who deal in margin scheme goods, pay VAT on the difference between the sale price and purchase price of certain second-hand goods.  Broadly speaking, for the purpose of the margin scheme, second-hand goods are moveable goods which are suitable for use either as they are or after repair.  The VAT rate which applies to a sale of goods under the margin scheme is, with some exceptions, the same rate of VAT which is normally applicable to the particular good. The scheme is optional however, so if a taxable dealer chooses not to operate the margin scheme, then normal VAT rules will apply.  </p>  <p>  Further information on the margin scheme can be found on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

Examples of revenue offences include tax or duty evasion, fuel fraud, supply or sale of illicit tobacco products.</p>  <p>  Because of the intrusive nature of the powers which it confers, the Act delimits clearly the circumstances in which they may be used and lays down the authorisations and approvals which must be obtained before they may be utilised. I know that Revenue is committed to ensuring that the powers conferred by the Act are used only in appropriate circumstances and in full conformity with the provisions and requirements of the Act.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s operation of the Act is overseen by a High Court Judge designated by the Government. The designated Judge has access to all official documents or records associated with authorisations under this Act. The Judge ascertains whether Revenue and other agencies are complying with the provisions of the Act and reports annually to the Taoiseach on any matters that are considered relevant. The designated Judge&rsquo;s Reports are published on the Oireachtas website.</p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides that it is an offence to disclose any information in connection with the operation of the Act or reveal the existence of an application for the issue of an authorisation. I am advised by Revenue that accordingly it does not disclose details of surveillance operations in which it may be engaged.</p>  <p>  I am assured by Revenue that it would not place a person or persons under surveillance for reasons other than the investigation of a revenue offence.

No stamp duty charge of that amount applies in respect of other types of bank account.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that there is no Government charge for closing a credit card account. However, and for the reason outlined above, on the assumption  that the question relates to section 124 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 which provides for an annual stamp duty at the rate of &euro;30 to be charged on credit card accounts, I can confirm that the charge under section 124 is applied where a credit card account is maintained with a financial institution at any time during the 12-month period ending on 1 April in any year.</p>  <p>  The &euro;30 charge applies to the account and not to the card - the number of cards issued to that account are not relevant. Stamp duty is charged to the account on 1 April each year in arrears unless the account is closed during the year. If the account is closed during a year and the card is cancelled, this will result in the &euro;30 charge to stamp duty being applied on the date of closure.  </p>  <p>  Where an account is closed and a stamp duty charge is applied, the financial institution should provide the account holder with a letter of closure, provided he or she has paid the &euro;30 charge.  In such circumstances, if the account holder opens a new account with another financial institution, he or she will not have to pay a stamp duty charge on the 1 April following the account closure if he or she presents this letter to the new financial institution.</p>  <p>Revenue has published guidance on stamp duty on credit and other financial cards on its website, which is available at Stamp Duty on financial cards (revenue.ie).</p>  <p>  On the wider matter of bank charges, the charging of fees is a commercial decision for regulated entities, within the parameters of the regulatory framework. This requires, under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended), that credit institutions must notify the Central Bank if they wish to: </p>  <p>  - Introduce any new customer charge for providing certain services; or</p>  <p>  - Increase any existing customer charge for providing certain services.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, I do not have a direct function in the operations of any bank.

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee.</p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p>  <p>  Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle-to-Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, including:</p>  <p>  - The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. </p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer.</p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.</p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle-to-Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.</p>  <p>  The Cycle-to-Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where college are employed in a full or part time capacity and their employer is willing to participate in the Scheme, they may participate in the scheme.  However, where the employer-employee relationship does not exist, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Cycle-to-Work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.

The proposals being considered aim to better position credit unions to grow as a key provider of community banking</p><p>In developing these proposals, Minister Fleming and officials have conducted extensive stakeholder engagement, meeting with the representative bodies, collaborative ventures, service providers, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the Registrar of Credit Unions and individual credit unions. The information gained from this engagement has helped inform the proposals which will be considered by Government shortly. </p></reply>

In addition, the legal rights and terms and conditions of a customer&rsquo;s mortgage agreement, including in relation to the interest rate, remain in place following a loan sale/transfer. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 if a loan is transferred or sold, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be regulated and must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers whose loans are sold or transferred, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also advised that it&rsquo;s supervision of any bank that withdraws from the market will be focused on ensuring that its customers are treated fairly, that it remains in compliance with the letter and spirit of regulatory requirements.  The Central Bank has clearly communicated the requirement for a customer-focused approach to be taken in all aspects of their business throughout the period of change and that they ensure that customers understand what the withdrawal means for them. </p>  <p>  Within the regulatory and contractual framework as outlined above, it is a commercial matter for individual banks and other lenders to set their lending interest rates. Neither I nor the Central Bank have a  role in prescribing or setting interest rates on individual loans.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, on 25 June 2021, the Central Bank issued an industry letter regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. These expectations reflect the Central Bank's assessment of possible risks to consumers during periods of change and reinforce previously communicated expectations, based on it's experience of prior events. The Central Bank also expects that by clearly outlining its expectations, this will inform regulated entities&rsquo; actions and decisions to ensure that customers&rsquo; interests are protected and potential risks are mitigated.</p></reply>

The gain attributed to that 7-year period will not attract CGT.

The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors as direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.</p><p>In order to ensure distribution of profits for taxation at the level of the shareholder, REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of property profits annually to shareholders.  REITs are obliged to operate Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT), at the standard rate of 25%, on distributions to shareholders. The DWT is available as a credit against the shareholder&rsquo;s tax liability.</p><p>For Irish investors:</p><p>- Individuals are liable to tax at their marginal rates on dividends received, with credit for the DWT deducted;</p><p>- Corporates will be liable to tax at 25%, with credit for DWT; and</p><p>- Institutional portfolio investors are liable to tax on REIT dividends at 12.5%, this being the rate generally applicable to trading income.</p><p>Foreign investors are also subject to the DWT at 25%. Those resident in treaty-partner countries may be able to reclaim some of this DWT under the relevant tax treaty. Tax treaty rates on dividends vary from treaty to treaty, but the most common rate applicable to small shareholdings would be 15% - this means that Ireland would retain taxing rights of 15% on dividends paid from Ireland.</p><p>Excluded investors, such as pension schemes or charities investing in the REIT, may receive distributions gross, subject to completion of appropriate declarations. Such entities are more generally exempt from tax or subject to gross roll-up regimes in view of their own purposes or objectives.</p><p>To avoid a double layer of taxation, a REIT (or a group REIT) is ordinarily exempt from corporation tax on income from its rental property business and chargeable gains accruing on disposal of assets of their property rental business.</p><p>Due to Revenue&rsquo;s obligation to protect taxpayer confidentiality, and there being fewer than 10 REITs, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the net tax revenue which would accrue if REIT companies were subject to corporation tax, rather than the current regime of taxation at the level of the shareholder. </p><p>However, REITs are required to be publicly listed companies and therefore publish information such as annual accounts online, which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p><p>In addition to the above, it should be noted that REITs are not entirely exempt from tax and there are a range of circumstances in which a REIT may accrue a direct tax liability, including the following:</p><p>- Any non-rental property profits are subject to corporation tax and capital gains tax in the normal manner. </p><p>- As REITs are designed to encourage long term property investment, there are anti-avoidance rules to prevent REITs being used as property development vehicles. If a REIT acquires an asset and following that acquisition, develops the asset to such an extent that the cost of development exceeds 30% of the market value of the asset at the time the development commenced, and the asset is then disposed of within 3 years of development, the corporation tax and capital gains tax exemptions will no longer apply.</p><p>- To prevent indefinite deferral of tax at the shareholder level, a REIT will be charged to corporation tax under Case IV of Schedule D if it distributes less than 85% of its annual property income. </p><p>- A REIT (or a group REIT) will also be charged to corporation tax under Case IV of Schedule D if it pays a dividend to a shareholder who holds more than 10% of its shares or if, in computing the profits available for distribution, it has taken a deduction for any amount which is not wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of:</p><p>- the property rental business, where it relates to the property rental business of the REIT, or</p><p>- the residual business where it relates to the residual business of the REIT. </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that gross REIT DWT collected in 2021 amounted to &euro;15,361,133. Revenue processed &euro;3,218,997 of REIT DWT refunds in 2021. </p></reply>

The Act requires the Commission to obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before reaching an agreement with any person in relation to rates of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights. In practice, this means that the Commission advises on matters relating to resourcing, grading and terms and conditions of employment and submits proposals for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration and agreement.</p>  <p>  In that regard, and as the Deputy is aware from a previous reply, there is a process underway at the Workplace Relations Commission dealing with the issues.

The OPW has produced an individual FRMP for each of the 29 River Basins including the Shannon Upper &amp;amp; Lower River Basin. The focus of the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is on the Shannon River Basin District.</p><p>The Government has committed &euro;1.3 billion to the delivery of flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2030 to protect approximately 23,000 properties in threatened communities from river and coastal flood risk. Since the launch of the FRMPs in 2018, as part of a phased approach to scheme delivery, this funding has allowed the OPW to treble to nearly 90 the number of schemes at design and construction at this time. </p><p>Today, work by the OPW is complete or underway to deliver protection to 80% of properties to be protected by this significant investment programme.</p><p>In the Shannon River Basin District, along with the 13 already completed schemes (see Appendix 1), a further 36 flood relief schemes will be delivered under the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1.3bn investment in flood relief measures over the lifetime of the NDP.</p><p>The OPW and the Local Authorities have been engaging pro-actively on the arrangements and structures to be put in place to advance the implementation of the Tranche 1 schemes. </p><p>Of the 24 Tranche 1 schemes currently being progressed (see Appendix 2), 2 schemes (Athlone and Springfield) are at construction. Engineering Consultants have been appointed for a further 13 schemes which are progressing through Stage 1 - Option Assessment, Scheme Development and Design including Kings Island which has received planning permission.  Construction is expected to commence in Q3 2022 with a completion date of approximately two years thereafter. </p><p>Work is ongoing to progress the other 9 schemes in the Shannon River Basin District.  8 of the schemes will be progressed directly by the relevant Local Authorities with full funding from the OPW.  The OPW is progressing the scheme for Rahan.</p><p>While the other 12 schemes recommended in the FRMPs have not yet commenced, it is planned that they will be underway in the lifetime of the NDP (see Appendix 3). </p><p>The Government has noted the study by the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group that supports a programme of strategic maintenance to help mitigate flooding along the River Shannon and a further study on the removal of a series of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; through the Shannon Callows that can help to delay flooding in the area. The Government has agreed that the OPW will provide &euro;7m for all of these works, of which &euro;4m relates to the removal of &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; through the Shannon Callows.  </p><p>Work is advancing to progress the project for the removal of the &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; in the Shannon Callows between Athlone and Meelick Weir.  A Steering Group has been established to oversee this project and a brief has been developed for the appointment of a consultant to carry out the initial analysis and design work.  It is anticipated that the tendering process for this service will commence during Q2 2022.  Waterways Ireland, on behalf of the Shannon Group, will act as the Contracting Authority for this project.  </p><p>The works can only commence following the completion of the appropriate environmental assessments which are expected to be significant.  In addition, planning consent will be required to progress the project.  This is a time intensive process and there are a range of variables outside the control of the Shannon Group that may impact on the overall timescale for the delivery of this project. </p><p>Should the Deputy require any further information, the OPW will be glad to provide the specific details.</p><p><b>Appendix 1 Completed Flood Relief Schemes</b> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">Completed Flood Relief Schemes </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1</td>       <td>Sixmilebridge, Co.

The review of the statutory framework that I have initiated and to which the Deputy&rsquo; question refers is the first step in meeting this commitment. </p><p>In brief, this review is examining:</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s existing ethics legislative framework;</p><p>- The recommendations made by the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) based on its operation of the current regime; </p><p>- International best practice; and</p><p>- The views of stakeholders including through a public consultation.</p><p>It will also consider the outstanding recommendations of the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals and take account of more recent developments such as: </p><p>- The &lsquo;Hamilton Report&rsquo; recommendations on preventing economic crime and corruption, published in December 2020; and</p><p>- The Council of Europe&rsquo;s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) recommendations on reform of our statutory framework for ethics.</p><p>The review&rsquo;s tasks have been underway since September 2021: formal stakeholder engagement commenced in November and a public consultation exercise based on a detailed proposed policy approach closed in mid-January 2022. I envisage that this process will be completed by end June 2022 and a report published. The outcome of the Review will then inform proposals for legislative reform that I intend to bring to Government later in 2022. In this, my ultimate goal is a fit-for-purpose, easy to understand and user-friendly statutory framework that contributes to the quality and effectiveness of our public governance and by so doing enhances trust and confidence in public officials and democratic institutions.</p></reply>

However, instead of restoring the PSSB to the D&aacute;il Order Paper, I asked my Department to undertake a review of the statutory framework in advance of bringing new proposals for reform back to Government. In this, my intention was to take account of any developments since the PSSB was last considered in the D&aacute;il, such as, for example, further potential gaps in the ethics framework that have arisen as matters of public debate, as well as relevant recommendations of the Review of Structures and Strategies to Prevent, Investigate and Penalise Economic Crime and Corruption (the &lsquo;Hamilton Report&rsquo;), which was published in December 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Ethics Review has been underway since September last, and I expect that the process will be completed by the end of June. The Review's outcome will then inform proposals for legislative reform that I intend to bring to Government later in 2022. In developing these fresh proposals, my Department will take as its point of departure the policy approach that was developed for the PSSB, given that it represents best practice on a number of fronts, and addresses many of the long-standing recommendations of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) and the Standards in Public Office Commission for reform of Ireland's statutory framework for standards in public life.</p></reply>

The original design for the Irish War Memorial Gardens included a bridge across the Liffey linking the northside of the river with the gardens. This element of the gardens has not been realised to date.</p>  <p>  At present, the current access point to the Irish War Memorial Gardens from the South Circular Road is confusing and ill-defined, with many visitors have trouble locating the gardens. </p>  <p>  In May 2019, the Office of Public Works (OPW) and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) announced a competition to design a new commemorative bridge at the Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Dublin. Sixty one submissions were received from nine countries. The winning design was submitted by Ian Ritchie Architects based in London.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the new commemorative bridge and entrance plaza linking the Irish National War Memorial Gardens to Cunningham Road and Phoenix Park will provide a formal entrance to the Gardens, will improve visitor experience and provide a significantly enhanced pedestrian and cycling access to the Gardens. The bridge will also support the development of  blue way and greenway cycle infrastructure in this part of the city by providing a clear connecting route across the river.</p>  <p>  To date there has been high-level engagement with key stakeholders including Dublin City Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, The Irish National War Memorial Garden Trustees, University College Dublin and local stakeholders including the various boat clubs based in the vicinity of the gardens. The development of this bridge is included in the Dublin City Council Development Plan 2022-2028. </p>  <p>  The OPW is now working closely with Ian Ritchie Architects, who won the architectural design competition for the commemorative bridge, to bring the original concept design to full planning permission. All appropriate baseline studies have been completed including the Feasibility Study, Ecological studies and a Business Development Strategy. A variation to the local area development plan to support this type of development was approved by DCC councillors in 2021.  It is anticipated that a planning application will be lodged later this year. Funding has been approved to planning permission stage.</p>  <p>  Subject to further availability of funding, a full procurement process will be undertaken and it is hoped that works will commence on site before the end of 2023.</p></reply>

The complex has had a long history of continuous use spanning three centuries and is considered to have special architectural, military, historical, social and archaeological interest. The Magazine Fort came into the care of the Office of Public Works (OPW) in the 1980's from the Department of Defence. It is a Protected Structure in the Dublin City Council Development Plan 2016 &ndash; 2022.</p>  <p>  Over the years, the OPW has undertaken certain works to protect the site and provide some minimal public access but is now embarking on a more substantial programme to conserve the Magazine Fort. The condition of the buildings and rampart walls is poor due to a series of interventions over the centuries. The OPW has commissioned a team of experts to progress the restoration and conservation of this unique fortification.</p>  <p>  This is a complex conservation project which will be addressed in a phased manner. The first phase of the project will focus on the stabilisation and structural repairs to the Rampart walls; roof and structural repairs to the Vaulted Magazine Store Buildings; conservation refurbishment works to the Bakery and minor drainage works surrounding the Magazine Store Buildings. This first phase of works will be tendered in May and it is anticipated that works will commence on site later this year. These works will be funded from within the OPW vote and total costs for this phase will be in the region of &euro;5million. </p></reply>

Over the last number of weeks, the number of Ukrainian refugees arriving into Rosslare on ferry services from Cherbourg have been steadily rising from about 30 to around 200 at present. As a result of the increasing numbers, it was clear to the port authorities that new facilities were urgently required to provide for the care and comfort of refugees as they waited to be brought to suitable accommodation, while also meeting the needs of the various departments and agencies interacting with them on their arrival.  </p>  <p>  The Port authorities therefore obtained the agreement of the Revenue Commissioners to vacate, on a temporary basis, an area normally used by them to facilitate the location of a mobile hub &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for the processing of Ukrainian refugees arriving into Ireland seeking safety and support. The Revenue Commissioners relocated their operation to their other facilities just outside the port at Kilrane. </p>  <p>  Following a request for assistance on 24th March from the Department of Transport, officials from the Office of Public Works immediately visited the site and identified an appropriate solution involving the installation of a large Marquee, a portacabin and toilet facilities. The installation of these units commenced on Sunday 27th of March and the works were completed last weekend. As a result, new arrivals, predominantly women and children, can now access suitable facilities at the port to meet with relevant officials from a number of organisations to quickly complete the immigration process and immediately apply for access to relevant services. The facility also contains an open lounge area with seating for 110 people, which will be manned by a humanitarian team. Refugees will be provided with food and drinks and can also access a storage area where they can select essential items such as clothes, sanitary items and toys for the children provided by charities and local communities before being brought to their assigned accommodation. In addition to the main space two adjacent tents are being managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with vets available to examine any pets coming through. Toilets are also available just outside the marquee.</p>  <p>  These facilities will ensure that refugees can be provided with temporary protection and immediate access to essential services on arrival in a timely and efficient fashion with minimal delay after a long and arduous journey to reach Ireland. </p>  <p>  The cost of the installation of this new infrastructure, including the initial month&rsquo;s rental payment, is &euro;165,000. The overall cost will depend on how long it is necessary to keep these units in place which is dependent on the flow of new arrivals at the port seeking international protection. While it is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the likely numbers over the coming months, I can assure the Deputy that the government is fully committed to maintaining these services at the port for as long as they are needed. The overall cost that would arise if the facilities remain in place for the rest of the year is estimated at &euro;650,000 inclusive of the initial installation cost.</p></reply>

Since the inscriptions of Hurling, my officials have met with both organisations on a number of occasions to discuss how best the Department can support them in safeguarding and raising awareness Hurling as an ICH practice. These discussions are ongoing and as with all elements on the Representative List, my Department is conscious that practitioners are the custodians of their practice and therefore safeguarding and transmission of same are led by the practitioners themselves.</p>  <p>  By achieving recognition of these practices on the UNESCO Representative List the practices are safeguarding for future generations. Inscriptions also serve to acknowledge and celebrate the work of the generations who have kept these traditions alive and provide a platform to highlight and share these cherished aspects of Irish culture with others. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Ireland submitted its periodic report to UNESCO to outline the legislative, regulatory and other measures undertaken for the safeguarding of ICH. The preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s report focused on the broad surveying of and engagement with relevant stakeholders including the GAA and The Camogie Association. The findings of the report will help inform and guide plans and priorities for ICH safeguarding over the coming years, while incorporating the Vision, Mission and Principles outlined for ICH in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with its Expert Advisory Committee to examine how it can most effectively work with ICH practitioners and existing agencies to raise awareness of and safeguard these practices for generations and looks forward to continuing to work with both the GAA and The Camogie Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to funding it should be noted that Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. This includes the allocation of funding across a variety of funding schemes to the GAA and The Camogie Association. In 2021, the GAA received in excess of &euro;2.3m and The Camogie Association received in excess of &euro;435,000 which assists with the wide promotion and engagement with Hurling.  In addition, in December 2021, Government allocated Covid-19 funding under five separate streams to help sports organisations to recover and grow post-pandemic, support our grassroots networks of clubs and local sports partnerships, and ensure that people of all ages and abilities could return to sport and physical activity.  This included &euro;20m allocated to the GAA, primarily to offset losses from the lack of spectators at matches, with &euro;6m being ring-fenced to support GAA, LGFA, Camogie &amp;amp; Handball Clubs.</p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.

This is the highest number of applications ever received.   </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8 million were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. </p>  <p>Currently my Department is assessing appeals from unsuccessful applicants. The deadline for submission of appeals was Monday 4 April 2022. Of the record &euro;150 million made available for capital projects, &euro;6 million has been kept in reserve for any successful appeals. </p>  <p>  When the appeal process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.

A total of 52 pools has been completed under the LASPP and three swimming pool projects (Lucan, Buncrana and Edenderry) remain in the programme with the Lucan project currently under construction. Since 2016, &euro;11.1 million has been drawn down under the LASPP.</p><p>My Department's capital support for any new swimming pools is now being provided through the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027. </p><p>The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4 million has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects as follows:</p><p>1.Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool [Allocation &euro;300,000]</p><p>2.Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park [Allocation &euro;300,000]</p><p>3.Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, [Allocation &euro;1,443,750]</p><p>4.Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure [Allocation &euro;646,659]</p><p>5.Wicklow: Wicklow Swimming Pool and Leisure Centre [Allocation &euro;864,177]</p><p>6.Louth: Dundalk Leisure Centre [Allocation &euro;300,000]</p><p>7.Galway: Galway Regional Aquatic &amp;amp; Fitness Centre [Allocation &euro;8,003,415]</p><p>8.Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2 [Allocation &euro;5,000,000]</p><p>The priority in the short term is to advance all LSSIF projects, including these swimming pools, to  construction stage. To date, none of the funding in respect of swimming pools has been drawn down. </p><p>In relation to future swimming pool funding, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals. The review work is at an advanced stage and is expected to be finalised shortly.</p><p>In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement a National Swimming Strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors. Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard. It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to take forward the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.</p><p>The outcome of these reviews and strategies will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations.</p><p>The overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations requires that all works should be carried out:</p><p>- Using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p><p>- With a proper standard of workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.</p><p>- By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.</p><p>The primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Interpretation of the legislation is, ultimately, a matter for the Courts and implementation of the Building Control system is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.  </p><p>Following a review undertaken by an independent fire expert, my Department published the 'Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in dwellings where concerns arise' in 2017. The framework which is available on my Department's website at <i>gov.ie/en/publication/2d9a3-framework-for-enhancing-fire-safety-in-dwellings-where-concerns-arise/ </i>contains the following:</p><p>- an explanation of the statutory provisions in respect of fire safety and the respective responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, occupants, local authorities;</p><p>- a range of actions that may reduce risk and improve the level of fire safety where deficiencies arise in dwelling houses, apartments and /or the common areas of apartment buildings; and </p><p>- a fire risk assessment methodology for professional advisors to prioritise the remedial actions, if any, that may need to be carried out on a dwelling.</p><p>The Framework is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. In addition to owners and occupants, the Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable the continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.</p></reply>

Local authorities submitted their Plans to me in December 2021. Preparation of these Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication by local authorities before the Summer. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing nationally.</p><p>Funding is being made available by Government to assist local authority of affordable housing delivery, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund, and Approved Housing Body delivery and the Cost Rental Equity Loan. </p><p>The first local authority affordable purchase homes to be completed will be at Boherboy Road in Cork City next month, where 22 two and three-bed dwellings are expected to be delivered at discounts of up to 20% on market value. These homes will range in price from &euro;218,000 to &euro;243,000. </p><p>Affordable purchase homes will also be delivered at Dun Emer in Lusk, Co Dublin by Fingal County Council in three phases this year. These two and three bed dwellings are expected to be delivered at an average discount of 25% on market values, ranging in price from &euro;166,000 to &euro;258,000.  In addition, South Dublin County Council recently advertised 16 affordable purchase homes in Kilcarbery, all to be delivered this year, that will cost between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300.</p><p>The LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s owned lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites. In the longer-term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which brings essential long-term stability to the Irish housing market. </p><p>There are 7 sites that the LDA are currently engaged in which are at advanced stages of pre development with an addition three at the early stages of pre development. </p><p>The Government's Housing for All Strategy identifies a further 20 sites, in addition to the LDA's initial sites, with the potential to yield up to 15,000 units over time. These lands will transfer to LDA ownership as soon as practicable. The LDA, in consultation with the relevant Department, will undertake the process of due diligence on these lands, which will determine the appropriate residential yield for each site and other issues arising such as relocation of services.</p><p>The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme by the end of Quarter 2 this year.  It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. This measure, targeted at First Time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. It will be available nationwide.</p><p>Other measures to allow buyers to access newly-constructed housing affordably such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.  Information on these schemes is available at the following links: <i>revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx</i>and<i>localauthorityhomeloan.ie/.</i></p></reply>

This is the successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme. It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for people on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. It is available for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The Local Authority Home Loan can also be used for the purchase of homes through State schemes such as the Tenant Purchase Scheme and Affordable Housing Schemes, with the exception of the First Home Scheme. </p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan assists borrowers in securing an affordable, long-term fixed rate mortgage to purchase a home of their own. The Scheme supports homeownership amongst lower to moderate income households by reducing the cost of mortgage finance and increasing the level of financing available, particularly for single applicants in urban areas. </p><p>Under the Local Authority Home Loan scheme the income ceiling for a single applicant seeking to purchase a home in counties where the scheme's house price limit is &euro;320,000 (Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow) has been increased from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000. In the rest of the country, where the scheme&rsquo;s house price limit is &euro;250,000, the income ceiling for a single applicant will remain at &euro;50,000. The income ceiling for joint applicants remains at &euro;75,000.</p><p>A 'Fresh Start' principle also applies to the Local Authority Home Loans scheme. This means that people who are divorced, legally separated/separated or the relationship has ended and have no interest in, or any financial obligation for any borrowings in respect of the family home are eligible to apply under this scheme.

This included the Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities &ldquo;Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing&rdquo; to planning authorities which aimed to prevent multiple units being sold to a single buyer. In addition a 10% stamp duty levy was introduced for the cumulative purchase of 10 or more residential houses in a 12 month period. This policy was aimed at ensuring a level playing field for traditional family home buyers, including but not limited to first-time buyers, while facilitating vital investment in high density apartments.  </p>  <p>  These Section 28 Guidelines aim to provide an &lsquo;owner-occupier&rsquo; guarantee by ensuring that new &lsquo;own-door&rsquo; houses and duplex units in housing developments can no longer be bulk-purchased by institutional investors in a manner that causes the displacement of individual purchasers or social and affordable housing, including cost-rental. </p>  <p> In addition, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 (No. 40 of 2021) came into effect on 17 December 2021. Section 7 provides that the housing strategy prepared by a local authority shall take into account the need to ensure that home ownership as a tenure type is provided for and estimated in its housing strategy. This amendment supports the implementation of Housing Policy Objective 1.10 and introduces the principle of home ownership, as a specific tenure type within a local authority&rsquo;s housing strategy, with particular regard to developments comprising houses and duplexes and gives further legislative effect to the provisions of the Section 28 Guidelines issued in May 2021. </p>  <p>  Initial data indicates that this policy has been impactful. Industry analysis suggests that, with changes made in 2021 in relation to the bulk purchase of single family residential units, the proportion of such purchases fell from 11% of residential deals in 2020 to 2% in 2021. In addition, more than 30% of the 46,000 homes purchased in 2021 were bought by first-time buyers.</p>  <p>  As we approach one year on from the introduction of these measures, I wrote to the Chief Executives of all 31 Local Authorities and the Chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 11 February requesting information on the number of units that have been permitted with a planning condition to prohibit multiple sales to a single purchaser arising from last year&rsquo;s Section 28 Guidelines and accompanying circular, as well as any information on compliance with the conditions and enforcement.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently collating and reviewing the data received and following this analysis, I intend publishing the data.</p></reply>

Part V allows local authorities purchase a percentage of land at less than the enhanced market value, with such land used thereafter to deliver social and affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  In line with Government commitments, the Part V provision was increased, via the Affordable Housing Act 2021, from 10% for social housing to a mandatory 20% for social, affordable and cost rental housing requirements.  The link to a specified percentage need in the Housing Strategy reflected in the Development Plan objectives was removed, ensuring the full share of the planning gain could be captured for the State on all applicable sites. The amended Part V provisions now require at least half of the planning gain to be applied to social housing provision, with the remainder to be applied to affordable housing, which can be affordable purchase, cost rental or both.</p>  <p>  The amendments came into effect on 3 September 2021 and apply to land purchased before 2015 and on or after 1 August 2021. Transitional arrangements have also been introduced and provide that the previous 10% Part V requirement will continue to apply to extant planning permissions and land purchased between 2015 and 2021. Near term supply will not be affected by these changes; however, this will change in 2026 when the 20% Part V requirement will apply to all land.</p>  <p>  This approach taken is balanced and fair, allowing supply to come forward at pace while also ensuring the State derives as much benefit as possible for social and affordable purposes.</p></reply>

The pipeline for Cost Rental delivery is being developed and delivery is expected to increase incrementally over the period to 2030, with the target of an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year or 18,000 in total. </p>  <p>  The introduction of Cost Rental will provide a more affordable and more secure form of long-term rental housing in Ireland. Rent levels for Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to market driven movement.</p>  <p>  Once tenanted, rents will increase only in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms, while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs for the properties.  Cost Rental schemes delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and local authorities will target cost-covering rents of at least 25% below comparable open market rates.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by AHBs, supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, along with funding for Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund. The Land Development Agency will also deliver Cost Rental, either on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  A Housing Delivery Action Plan prepared by each Local Authority will underpin delivery of cost rental homes to 2026. Each local authority submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each and the final Delivery Action Plans are expected to be published in Q2.  </p>  <p>  To date, funding support has been provided to deliver almost 900 Cost Rental homes.  The first 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, with funding from the CREL scheme covering up to 30% of the capital costs in each of the two developments. Both developments also delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open market prices.</p>  <p>  The tenanting process is currently underway for a further 44 new Cost Rental homes at the Parklands development in Citywest, also supported by CREL funding and being delivered by the Tuath AHB. Projected rents are &euro;1,264 per month for two-bedroom apartments and &euro;1,297 per month for two-bedroom duplexes. Tenants have been moving into a further 50 Cost Rental homes since the 14th of March 2022 at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside. These Cost Rental homes were delivered by the Tuath and Respond AHBs, in collaboration with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The cost-covering rent for these two-bedroom apartments is &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a very significant discount on market prices in the area (c. &euro;2,000).</p></reply>

The designation of all existing RPZs has also been extended until 31 December 2024. The Act provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p>  <p>  The Act also introduced measures to better protect tenants with affordability by prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for February 2022 shows HICP inflation of 5.7% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. </p>  <p>  In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. </p></reply>

This provision respects the landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected rights to terminate a tenancy in accordance with section 34 of the Acts.</p>  <p>  Only new tenancies commencing on or after 11 June 2022 must be on the basis of an unlimited duration, but naturally over time, all &lsquo;Part 4 tenancies&rsquo; will be of unlimited duration. </p>  <p>  As existing Part 4/further Part 4 tenancies terminate/expire over time or are renewed, it will involve the creation of a new tenancy of unlimited duration in respect of any such dwelling, should it remain in the rental sector.

Building on the significant amendments already made to the scheme in 2017, the 2021 Review, which was published on the 24 January 2022, examined the impact of these changes and what further changes would benefit those in need of the scheme. While the scheme is performing well, it was assessed that some further enhancements were needed to enable more households in need of State support with their long-term housing needs to avail of this scheme.Four broad categories of actions are identified in the review, including:</p><p>a) broadening eligibility criteria;</p><p>b) improving the scheme process, structure and financing;</p><p>c) increasing communication and awareness raising; and</p><p>d) responding to developments around mortgage arrears solutions.</p><p>As part of the enhancements to broadening the eligibility criteria to ensure more households will be eligible for the scheme there is a new amendment to allow flexibility where the household concerned is over accommodated (i.e. has more than 2 spare bedrooms above the current needs of the household). Flexibility on over accommodation may be allowed where:</p><p>a) the borrower or one of the joint borrowers is aged 65 and over</p><p>b) the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property has been significantly and permanently adapted to their needs</p><p>c) the borrower, one of the joint borrowers or one of the borrower&rsquo;s dependents has a disability and the property is specifically suitable to their needs without adaptations</p><p>In the case of (b) and (c) above, the household must also qualify for Social Housing Support on disability, medical or compassionate grounds in line with the local authority&rsquo;s allocation policy. Such flexibility is subject to the local authority or AHB (as appropriate) reserving the right to accommodate the household in more appropriate accommodation, if available, in the future.</p><p>This is one of a number of changes outlined in the 2021 Review and has been implemented under the scheme since 14 February 2022.</p><p>Full details of the recommendations and associated actions are outlined within the 2021 Review of the Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme for people who have borrowed from commercial private lending institutions and this review is available on the Department's website under Publications: www.gov.ie/en/publication/ed57b-2021-review-of-the-mortgage-to-rent-scheme-for-borrowers-of-commercial-private-lending-institutions/</p></reply>

The Government approved a number of amendments on foot of the review and these came into effect on 1st February 2022.</p>  <p>  The amendments include a reduction in the minimum reckonable income required to be eligible under the scheme from &euro;15,000 to &euro;12,500. This means older tenants, whose only income might be the contributory or non-contributory State pension, may qualify to buy their homes if they have the financial means to do so. The time an applicant is required to be in receipt of social housing supports to be able to apply under the scheme has also been revised. This has been increased from one to ten years. </p>  <p>  Further changes to the scheme are currently being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda.</p></reply>

Through <i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland,</i>the Government&rsquo;s strategic housing plan to 2030, the Government is committed to taking action to prevent entries into homelessness in the first instance and to help those experiencing homelessness to exit into secure and sustained tenancies.  It also includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of the Housing First programme, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided for homeless persons.</p><p>Under <i>Housing for All</i>, my Department has committed to actively participate through the newly established European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH) to advance the Lisbon Declaration on Combatting Homelessness signed in June 2021. Under EPOCH, Ireland has committed to &ldquo;promote the prevention of homelessness, access to permanent housing and the provision of enabling support services to the homeless&rdquo;. <i>Housing for All </i>outlines how the Government will work towards ending homelessness by 2030, detailing 18 distinct actions tailored to achieve this target. This includes increasing access to supports for both individuals and families.</p><p>Ireland has committed to support EPOCH policy measures with adequate funding and, when appropriate, make use of EU funding as a lever to improve the way the EU address homelessness. Budget 2022 made provision for &euro;194 million in funding for homeless services. This funding in 2022 reflects the priority the Government is giving to homelessness. </p><p>Under EPOCH, Ireland has committed to share good practices in combatting homelessness. I recently attended a ministerial level meeting of EPOCH, whereby I discussed the most pressing issues in homelessness today with my European colleagues, and where the work programme of the Platform was adopted.</p><p>As provided for in <i>Housing for All</i>, the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC) was established in Q4 2021. The first meeting took place in December 2021 and the second took place in February of this year. The work of NHAC is informed by <i>Housing for All</i>. The overarching objective of NHAC is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in the Plan, along with bringing better coherence and coordination of homeless-related services in delivering policy measures and actions to address homelessness. It is intended that meetings of NHAC will take place quarterly, with the third meeting due to be held in April. Details in respect of NHAC and a note of its meetings are published on my Department&rsquo;s website on an ongoing basis</p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a Youth Homelessness Strategy and this is articulated in <i>Housing for All</i>. It was agreed at the first meeting of the NHAC that the development of this Strategy would be one of the first priorities of NHAC.  </p><p>The aim of this Strategy is to help young people who are aged 18 &ndash; 24 and who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.</p><p>A 3-week Public Consultation ran from 22 February and further consultations will take place in the next month. My Department, with the support of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, is also consulting directly with a number of key stakeholders. The Strategy is currently being developed and is intended for publication later this year.</p><p><i>Housing for All</i>also committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The new Plan outlines the targets for each region and in each year.</p><p>The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the criminal justice sector (the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service) and Local Authorities, in conjunction with NGO partners. Each partner is committing the necessary resources and supports to implement the programme. A new Housing First Directorate has been established, and is based in the Housing Agency. The newly appointed Director is responsible for managing the implementation of the new Plan. </p><p>To aid in the further expansion of the Housing First approach, and in line with commitments made in <i>Housing for All</i>, it is planned to extend outreach and intensive engagement services to every region in the country ensuring that those most in need of the intense supports provided by Housing First will be able to avail of them.</p><p>To support this commitment The Housing Agency, in partnership with the HSE and in consultation with key Departments and agencies, is developing a good practice manual for the operation of assertive outreach services. This manual will assist regions in expanding outreach services into those urban areas in which rough sleeping is understood to be a concern. This manual is to be published by mid-2022.</p><p>Resources are being made available to expand outreach services. As part of their homelessness expenditure programmes for 2022, which are supported by Exchequer funding, local authorities were invited in November 2021 to submit proposals to my Department for additional outreach services in their annual expenditure programme for 2022.</p></reply>

The Fresh Start principle extends the supports available under both Affordable Purchase schemes and the Local Authority Home Loan scheme to applicants who are divorced, legally separated, or where the relationship has ended and where they retain no beneficial interest in a home. The Fresh Start principle will also apply to those who have previously purchased a residential property but have been divested of this through personal insolvency or bankruptcy arrangements, proceedings or other legal processes.</p><p>Specifically in relation to the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme, the Fresh Start principle has already been accommodated under Part 2, Section 10 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021. This scheme assists first-time buyers (as well as those eligible under the Fresh Start principle) purchasing Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations setting out the detailed eligibility criteria for the scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.</p><p>Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the First Home scheme, which will act in a similar way to the Local Authority-led scheme, though it will apply to homes purchased through the private market. Under both schemes, an equity stake corresponding to the level of support provided is taken in the market value of the home. The supported home-owner will have an option to achieve full ownership by buying-out the equity stake in the purchased property at a timing of their own discretion. An equity buy-out will be required in circumstances where the home is sold or passed on, or ceases to the primary residential residence. </p><p>The First Home scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications, including those eligible under the Fresh Start principle, in the second half of this year. This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.</p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan is a Government backed mortgage scheme for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build.</p><p>The &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle applies for applications to State loan schemes such as the Local Authority Home Loan. The following categories of persons are eligible to apply for the Local Authority Home Loan under the Fresh Start principle:</p><p>- Applicant(s) that previously purchased or built a residential property, but is divorced and has left the property and divested themselves of their interest in the property are eligible. </p><p>- Applicant(s) that previously purchased a residential property, but have been divested of this through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, are eligible to apply.

The Report considered what measures could be undertaken to ensure that a substantial portion of the increase in land value attributable to the decisions of public authorities, could be secured for the benefit of the community.</p><p>A commitment was included in the Programme for Government to review how such community gain proposals could be captured and the principle of Land Value Sharing was subsequently adopted in <i>Housing for All</i>.  Land Value Sharing involves securing a share of the difference in land value before zoning or designation and the point at which planning permission is granted.  Land Value Sharing will apply in the first instance to all newly-zoned residential land, and to Urban Development Zones which are also proposed in <i>Housing for All</i>.  Urban Development Zones will provide for a coordinated plan-led approach to the development of areas with significant potential for residential and urban growth, where Land Value Sharing will also apply and will involve land assembly provisions to ensure that land critical to the provision of infrastructure can be secured.</p><p>In line with Housing Policy Objective 12.1 contained in <i>Housing for All</i>, my officials are now in the process of developing Land Value Sharing Mechanisms.  </p><p>A General Scheme for a Heads of Bill was approved by Government in December 2021 outlining the general provisions for the establishment of Land Value Sharing obligations.  Work is now progressing on the more detailed aspects of how this legislation may be implemented, including all necessary due diligence and scrutiny.  A detailed economic appraisal of the proposed measures, involving an assessment of the potential implications in different locations and circumstances, is being undertaken to determine what uplift in value would be reasonable for the State to secure. This includes independent expert advice. This research and expert advice will provide the basis for the detail of these measures.</p><p>A key aspect of this work will include stakeholder engagement, including with representatives of Local Authorities and State agencies, through a working group to ensure a workable set of measures is progressed. Proposals for engagement are currently being finalised in parallel with the economic appraisal, with detailed drafting of the Bill to commence in Q3 2022 and the enactment of the legislation proposed for Q4 2022.</p></reply>

The Residential Zoned Land Tax was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2021. The purpose of the proposed measure is to incentivise the activation of land which is zoned and serviced for residential development, but remains undeveloped. It is primarily intended to influence behaviour towards increased housing output, rather than to raise revenue. The tax will replace the Vacant Site Levy. </p>  <p>  The significant benefit of the tax is to incentivise the development of suitably zoned land across the State which has been the beneficiary of costly investment in servicing for housing construction. This includes lands in cities, towns and village centres which are vacant or idle where zoned for mixed use including residential. The tax measure, in conjunction with the ongoing review of development plans throughout the state to identify and zone housing land needed to meet statutory Housing Supply Targets will ensure that delivery of housing on zoned and serviced land is progressed. The tax will, when it comes into effect in 2024, be applied at an annual taxation rate of 3% of market value of the land to encourage use for appropriate development.  </p>  <p>  The tax will apply to all land zoned for residential or a mix of uses including residential and which are serviced throughout all 31 local authorities, with certain lands excluded from scope, as set out within the legislation. The role of the local authorities is to identify the lands in scope via a mapping process commencing November 2022, which includes appeal provisions where the relevant landowner considers that a parcel of land does not meet the criteria for falling within the scope of the tax.  </p>  <p>  The tax will be managed by the Revenue Commissioners. After the publication of the final maps in December 2023, the maps will be reviewed annually by local authorities to ensure they are up to date. The tax will remain as a charge on the land, will be applied annually and will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners, incentivising the development of the land-bank by the owners, or the sale of the land to those who will undertake development.  </p>  <p>  Existing dwellings and their gardens, while they will be included in the maps, are not included in the scope of the tax.  </p>  <p>  Landowners may also make submissions to local authorities during the public consultation periods on the maps in 2022/23 only to amend zonings to remove their lands from the scope of the tax. In considering these submissions and the potential for varying the adopted development plan as a result, the local authorities must take into account the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and the need to zone sufficient land to meet the statutory Housing Supply Targets.  </p>  <p>  My Department notified all local authorities of the introduction of the tax measure on signing of the Finance Act 2021. My Department is preparing guidance on the mapping process and the management of rezoning requests and will liaise with stakeholders through a working group.  Financial support and assistance to the local authorities will also be provided on this matter to ensure that the maps will be published as required by the legislation. My Department will bring forward separate transitionary legislation to repeal the vacant site levy arrangements and this will take account of lands that might otherwise fall out of the full scope of the Vacant Site Levy, that are currently subject to the Vacant Site Levy. </p></reply>

The overall aim of this new housing plan for Ireland is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.</p><p>Aligned with the overall objective for compact growth, vibrant, liveable cities must offer options for both owner occupiers and renters in cities, at all income levels.  A key focus of <i>Housing for All</i>is to ensure that those who wish to purchase a home, have sufficient location choice.  This is particularly the case for the core of our cities, towns and villages.</p><p>The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe<b></b>fund as outlined in <i>Housing for All</i>, is intended to ensure that aligned with the objectives of the National Planning Framework, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres.It will do this by expanding home ownership options, where the choice is currently limited:</p><p>- In urban areas, for apartment living over a certain height/density threshold</p><p>- In towns, where options for building new private dwellings has been constrained by the lack of serviced sites.</p><p>It is clear that in higher density locations, there is insufficient apartments being built for sale.  To overcome this viability challenge, and given the high level of unactivated permissions particularly for apartments in our urban areas, a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) fund is being established, which will ensure that these developments can be built more viably for sale to owner occupiers.  This measure is based on activating the planning permissions already in place for such homes over the coming five years.  </p><p>It will be managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of the Department, and will be operated on an open book accounting basis, to ensure that financial support provided feeds through in reduced costs to the home-buyers.It is also envisaged that measures in <i>Housing for All</i>to support greater construction productivity and reducing the cost of land through changes to planning legislation, will also encourage a more sustainable market for such housing thereafter. </p><p>My Department is currently working with the Housing Agency on finalizing the operational basis for the new fund and expect to engage prospective proposers in a call for proposals in Q2 2022.</p></reply>

The target for the HAA fund was to acquire 1,600 units over a four year period to 2020 with this target subsequently extended out to 2021. </p>  <p>  The HAA fund has enabled the Housing Agency to actively engage with banks and investment companies in relation to the acquisitions of properties. Through the provision of direct access to capital funding for the Housing Agency, the aim was to simplify the current acquisition process for vacant portfolio purchases; speed up the acquisition process and to encourage investors to make additional supply available. The HAA fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the Approved Housing Body (AHB) sector and the funds received are recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. </p>  <p>  This was intended to be a medium term initiative, targeting the vacant property portfolios of financial institutions and investment companies, in direct response to the social housing shortage that would be designed to complement, not displace, ongoing targeted acquisition activity by local authorities and AHBs. </p>  <p>  As at Q3 2021, 888 units were delivered under the Housing Agency Acquisitions fund programme and an additional 562 properties were acquired by the Housing Agency Acquisitions team on behalf of local authorities. The number of homes acquired though the HAA fund and made available to AHBs under Caretaker Lease are included in my Department's overall quarterly reporting which is available at the following link: </p>  <p>www.housing.gov.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.  </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency continues to engage with financial institutions and it is clear that the supply of properties that the fund was established to acquire has substantially declined. </p>  <p>  Under the commitment in Housing For All, my Department has completed a review of the HAA fund, which investigated the challenges faced by the HAA fund and explored opportunities that centred on potentially repurposing the fund to support other initiatives within Housing for all.  This review was recently submitted to me for consideration. It will also be necessary for the conclusions and recommendations of the review to be discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of possible amendments to the original sanction for the fund which they provided. </p></reply>

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 allows local authorities to offer less than 100% refund and to vary the level of refund for vacant properties at its annual budget meeting.  Since the introduction of the Act, a number of local authorities have taken the decision to reduce the percentage refund of rates available. In agreeing budgets for 2022, 19 local authorities made the decision to offer less than 100% refund to vacant properties, ensuring in those local authorities that some rates are paid on vacant commercial properties, helping discourage prolonged vacancy.</p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernised the legislation governing commercial rates<b></b>and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties.<b></b>Section 9 of the Act provides that the Minister may specify the maximum vacancy relief to be applied and that schemes can be made to provide abatement to a specific class or classes of vacant property.  The main objective of section 9 of the Act is to discourage commercial vacancy and incentivise occupancy by ensuring all vacant properties pay some rates. This marries with the main objectives in &ldquo;Town Centres First&rdquo;. </p><p>Amendments are required to address key issues in the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019.

Action 19.13 of Housing For All commits to commencing section 9 of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019. Guidance for elected members on the making of schemes under section 9, and on the flexibility and potential provided by the provision, will be key to empowering them to make schemes that will affect improvements locally to commercial vacancy. It is expected that guidance in this regard will issue to local authorities concurrently with the commencement of the legislation and taking effect of associated regulations.</p></reply>

My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). </p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.  </p><p>With regard to the specific project to which the Question refers, I can confirm that the project received conditional CALF funding approval in 2018. The most recent update from both the AHB and Local Authority is that they are currently working collaboratively to progress the project to Tender stage, which is anticipated shortly, with expected final delivery in 2023.</p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.

These new homes will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, and Local Authorities, funded by the Affordable Housing Fund. The Land Development Agency will also deliver Cost Rental, either on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 allocated &euro;70 million to the CREL scheme for Cost Rental delivery by AHBs in 2022. Over 900 homes have been approved for funding under the scheme to date, with a total of almost 4,000 CREL-funded homes being targeted for delivery over the 5 years to 2026.</p>  <p>  Under the Second Call for Proposals for CREL funding, issued to AHBs in October 2021, I approved in principle the allocation of &euro;53.6 million for the provision of 521 Cost Rental homes across 11 sites in 7 Local Authority areas. Details of the funded projects, including locations, unit types and cost-covering rents will be released when the relevant AHBs have completed necessary financial and commercial arrangements.</p>  <p>  With regard to the CREL scheme, the Government provides loans to AHBs to finance up to 30% of the capital costs for new Cost Rental homes. The CREL loans will be for a 40-year term, with simple rather than compound interest, fixed at 1% for the loan term, and will not require any repayment until the end of the loan term. CREL funding will reduce the financing costs of AHB projects and will therefore directly reduce the cost-covering rents to be charged to tenants. While AHBs may invest their own equity, it is anticipated the majority of remaining capital costs will be primarily sourced from long-term commercial debt funding. To this end, the Housing Finance Agency has indicated 40-year loans will be made available for CREL-approved projects, with very competitive interest fixed for the first 30 years and variable rate for the remaining 10 years. The decision to grant CREL funding will always be taken on the basis of value for money.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, an open Rolling Call will be established under CREL this year. This will facilitate ongoing applications from AHBs, as projects present themselves, will assist with applications for Cost Rental and social housing, through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility, on the same sites and will facilitate longer-term developments, where AHBs can purchase land and undertake design and build contracts directly.</p></reply>

The Land Development Act 2021 was signed into law in July 2021. Following the recent commencement of relevant provisions of the LDA Act and the dissolution of the interim LDA entity, the LDA has now been established as a wholly commercial state body, with all functions and staff of the interim LDA entity transferred to the new LDA Designated Activity Company (DAC). This LDA DAC was incorporated by the Company Registration Office in December 2021.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding of &euro;7.1 million has been allocated to the LDA DAC Commercial Agency in 2022 to cover expenditure associated with their non-commercial functions.

The LDA drew down &euro;10m of capital funding and &euro;6.6m of current funding overall during 2021. It should be noted that Covid related safety restrictions impacted the progression of the LDA's projects during 2021. From a 2021 Exchequer funding perspective, there was not a distinction between commercial and non-commercial activities for the recently dissolved Interim LDA entity under its 2018 Establishment Order.</p>  <p>  Under the LDA Act, equity investment funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion will be made available to the LDA for the purposes of its economic activities through transfers from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (&ldquo;ISIF&rdquo;). The LDA will also have the ability to borrow up to &euro;1.25 billion to fund these activities. In accordance with Section 25(2) of the LDA Act, an initial &euro;100 million of the LDA&rsquo;s &euro;1.25 billion ISIF investment capital has now been transferred from ISIF by the National Treasury Management Agency to the LDA DAC.</p></reply>

A key objective is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. </p><p>The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund as outlined in Housing for All, is intended to ensure that, aligned with the objectives of the National Planning Framework, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres. </p><p>In higher density locations, the number of apartments being built for sale poses a challenge. There is a high level of unactivated permissions, particularly for apartments, in our urban areas. A Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) fund is being established which, through a competitive bid process, will seek to deliver developments at a viable cost for sale to owner occupiers, targeted principally at activating the planning permissions already in place for such homes over the coming five years. The fund will be managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department. My Department is working with the Housing Agency in finalising the operational basis for the new fund and expect to engage prospective proposers in a call for proposals in the near future.</p><p>  Different challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply. There is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high. A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025. The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is currently under consideration and it is expected that a call for proposals will issue to local authorities shortly.</p><p>The specific General Government Balance impacts of Exchequer Investment from the voted expenditure provision for both schemes is a matter that would fall to be determined by the Central Statistics Office.</p></reply>

CAS funding also supports other important and emerging areas of housing need including the development of refuges for victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, housing for care leavers (people exiting State care at the age of 18), and de-congregation (people with a disability being enabled to move from large institutions (congregated settings) to their own homes in the community with the support they need.</p>  <p>  Exchequer funding of &euro;96 million in 2021 delivered 352 units of independent living accommodation for a range of priority categories of housing need and 150 bed spaces for single homeless individuals although it should be noted that delivery of new accommodation units does not always arise in the same year as expenditure and projects may cross a number of payment periods. At the same time, CAS accommodation delivery can range from atypically large units for people with physical disability to group homes for people with intellectual disability to domestic violence refuges and the cost of delivering additional CAS housing will depend on which categories are involved. While the cost per bedroom under CAS build projects varies significantly, the average cost in 2021 was &euro;130,915.

However the advancement of individual projects against a range of milestones cannot be predicted in all cases; for example projects designed by the local authorities can be refused or altered as part of the Part 8 planning process.  Accordingly, it's important to allow as much flexibility as possible in local authority delivery across the range of programmes and for the range of individual projects and therefore, I have not allocated specific funding or targets to the individual delivery streams such as construction, PPPs, turnkeys, Part Vs or acquisitions; instead local authorities can draw funding as and when required which allows my Department to deploy the A3 funding where it is needed to ensure that social housing delivery in maximised in every budgetary cycle.</p>  <p>  I am keen that all local authorities advance their construction related activity as rapidly as possible and my Department will fully support them in this regard.</p></reply>

This scheme will support eligible first-time buyers to buy a new-build home in private developments by means of an equity share model, similar to that employed in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. This equity support will cover up to 30% of the price of a new home (or 20% if the purchaser also benefits from the Help to Buy incentive), subject to regional price ceilings which will reflect the median prices paid by first-time buyers for new homes.</p><p>First Home will be jointly funded on a 50:50 basis by the State and participating mortgage lenders, thereby increasing the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners. Subject to final approvals, it will operate for the period 2022 to 2025, deploying an anticipated funding of c. &euro;400 million and supporting an estimated 8,000 home purchases. Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44 million to my Department for First Home this year.  </p><p>A new First Home Scheme Ireland DAC, incorporated in December, will operate this scheme. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. Initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will be undertaken over the next months in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2 this year.</p><p>It should be noted that there is no 'subsidy' element in the support offered by the First Home Scheme. Through the First Home DAC, the State is making an investment in these purchases in order to enable people to achieve home ownership The DAC's equity interest in the homes will be redeemed in time and the State's share of the proceeds returned to the Exchequer. The benefit for purchasers is the opportunity to become a homeowner now at a reduced cost, with the ability to redeem the DAC's equity share at a future time of the homeowner's choosing, but with no obligation for redemption save for particular circumstances such as the sale of the home. </p></reply>

The Land Development Agency (LDA) is at the heart of this plan, advancing their remit to develop land, including public lands, for housing or other purposes.</p>  <p>  The LDA&rsquo;s Project Tosaigh is a market engagement initiative to unlock land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners due to financing and other constraints and use it to accelerate the supply of affordable housing. It allows the LDA to supplement the State lands it is already working on and accelerate the delivery of cost rental and affordable purchase homes by unlocking private land that is ready to be developed but where construction has stalled or not commenced.</p>  <p>  It is characterised by:</p>  <p>  - Activation of planning consents that have not commenced or are proceeding more slowly than optimal;</p>  <p>  - Achieving delivery both in the near term, as well as providing a 5-year programme of delivery;</p>  <p>  - An open and transparent process, compliant with procurement rules; </p>  <p>  - A focus on delivery of affordable homes with some social homes to be secured if conditions allow, while securing value for money for the State.</p>  <p>  Under this initiative, the target is to deliver 5,000 new homes by 2026 through cost rental or affordable purchase to eligible households.  I am advised by the LDA that the proposals they received on foot of their Expressions of Interest call for Phase 1 of Project Tosaigh related to delivery in 2022, 2023, 2024 and beyond. Negotiations with housebuilders for homes for cost rental and affordable purchase, with priority afforded to schemes with 2022 and 2023 delivery, are ongoing. While it is challenging to secure delivery at the targeted scale within 2022, the LDA is focussed on this through its negotiations and is clear on the Government&rsquo;s priorities in this respect. The LDA will be able to provide a clearer view on numbers and tenures as it gets closer to contractual commitments.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to affordable homes, using various funding streams available to help reduce the ultimate purchase or rental cost, Housing for All targets the delivery of 36,000 Affordable Purchase homes and 18,000 Cost Rental homes up to 2030. These homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and participating retail banks (the First Home shared equity scheme).   </p>  <p>  The CSO Wholesale Price Index shows the annual increase for building and construction materials to be 17.7% to the end of February 2022. The latest data shows that productivity in the construction sector remains below 2010 levels and is less productive than EU average.  Construction costs have risen considerably over recent years through a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits that the Government and relevant State agencies will advance methods to reduce residential construction costs, particularly the cost of apartment construction, by increasing the focus of existing and planned construction related initiatives on the residential construction sector, and by ensuring a coordinated, whole-of-government, approach to residential construction.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government will enhance the intended role of the new Construction Technology Centre, which is under development by Enterprise Ireland, beyond the standard remit of Technology Centres in general for its first three years of operation in order to prioritise residential construction, in particular by incorporating:</p>  <p>  - structures and funding to enable innovation in residential construction prior to the National Standards Authority of Ireland compliance processes, including demonstration, certification, standardisation and commercialisation as well as research and development;</p>  <p>  - a proactive role in strengthening the residential construction value chain;</p>  <p>  - promotion, development and support for innovation / modern methods of construction (MMCs) using digital and manufacturing technology;</p>  <p>  - support for SMEs to develop scale and to adopt MMCs and Building Information Modelling techniques for residential construction; and</p>  <p>  - support for digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction e.g. digitally controlled manufacturing equipment.</p>  <p>  This will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector. This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to temper price inflation.</p>  <p>  In addition the CSG supported by my Department are also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost (including cost of compliance) and increasing standardisation. It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government departments and industry.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Government policy, social and affordable housing construction projects (as with all publicly funded construction projects), must be procured in accordance with the Capital Works Management Framework. The Office of Government (OGP) is responsible for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly in relation to construction procurement.</p>  <p>  The OGP recently introduced the following interim measures to address the impact that the recent price increases in construction materials is having on public works tenders:</p>  <p>  - Reduced fixed price period duration to 24 months (previously 30 months minimum).</p>  <p>  - Permit mutual cost recovery within the fixed price period for material price changes in excess of 15% (previously 50%)</p>  <p>  - Introduction of a new mechanism to address the period between tender submission and award through limited indexation of the tender price</p>  <p>  The above measures relate to new public works contracts going forward.</p></reply>

Together these two schemes will support the purchase of 36,000 affordable homes under the Government's <i>Housing for All</i>strategy.</p><p>Both of these schemes will use an equity support model to assist eligible purchasers. In the case of Local Authority Affordable Purchase, this equity stake will be equivalent to the reduction in price from the full market value of the home and will be held by the Local Authority. In the case of the national First Home Scheme, the equity stake will be the funding provided to bridge the gap between someone's maximum mortgage under the Central Bank Mortgage Measures and the price of a new home (within regional price ceilings reflective of median first-time buyer prices). Subject to final approvals, equity under the First Home Scheme is to be funded by the State and participating mortgage providers on a 50:50 basis and will be held by a Special Purpose Vehicle (the First Home Scheme Ireland DAC). </p><p>For both schemes contractual arrangements will be put in place between the equity holder, be it a local authority or the First Home scheme, and the purchaser. These contracts will fully detail the rights and responsibilities of the signatories and will contain the necessary covenants to fully protect the State&rsquo;s interest. </p><p>The State&rsquo;s interest will be registrable as a beneficial interest in the Land Registry as an act of the homeowner affecting the dwelling. Under both schemes, the purchaser of the home can redeem or &lsquo;buy out&rsquo; this equity stake, in full or in part, at a time of their choosing. Since the equity stake will be redeemed at the current market price of the home, there is potential for its value to both rise and fall, though over the long term it is expected that market prices will rise. This brings both risk and benefit for the holder of the equity, but the potential risk is proportionate to the size of the equity stake in the home, and in the case of the jointly funded First Home Scheme the risk is shared 50:50 by the State and participating mortgage lenders.</p></reply>

This enables the accelerated delivery of housing on key development sites in Dublin and in urban areas of high demand. LIHAF is designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices. It&rsquo;s important to note that LIHAF projects involve complex, large scale public infrastructure developments which pave the way for associated housing development. This requires extensive design, planning, public consultation and procurement processes in advance of the projects moving to construction. With this in mind, construction of housing has started on a number of LIHAF projects across the country. </p>  <p>  Local Authorities have been requested by my Department to submit information regarding LIHAF housing delivery in 2021 and overall. A small number of Local Authorities are still in the process of collating total housing delivery figures for 2021 and will provide this information to my Department once they are finalised. </p>  <p>  Based on data provided by Local Authorities to my Department in September 2021, 494 units had been completed up to that point in 2021, of which 186 were cost reduced units. The overall total housing delivery under the LIHAF scheme at September 2021 is 3,348 units, which includes 1,592 cost reduced units. </p>  <p>  The Serviced Site Fund (SSF) provided for key enabling infrastructure to help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent.  The SSF has been replaced by the Affordable Housing Fund, however a number of projects approved under the SSF are progressing as planned.</p>  <p>  There were three SSF projects under construction in 2021 and the Covid pandemic has had an impact on the projected timelines for delivery of housing due to the closure of the construction sector in early 2021. Accordingly, no units were delivered in 2021, however the delivery of units has already commenced this year, with 50 cost rental units completed in March 2022.</p></reply>

These centres run events for the general public, offer visits for community groups such as senior citizens and scouts.  The Parks promote the importance of biodiversity and the natural world, to both primary and secondary school groups, through nature days and fieldwork.  This service has continued over the course of the pandemic, where appropriate, and my Department expects another busy summer for the Parks and Wildlife Centres as the numbers of people holidaying at home in Ireland are expected to remain at a high level this year.</p></reply>

The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p>  <p>  The Integrity Unit of the Passport Service was established in 2015 to improve all aspects of passport fraud detection and prevention. Significant resources have been invested in the Integrity Section with an increase in staff numbers and new and improved systems being put in place. A considerable investment in technology and structures has helped to improve the detection and recording of instances of fraud. These resources, along with new procedures introduced by the Passport Service, have prevented fraudulent applications from being submitted and have closed down avenues of access previously used by fraudulent applicants.</p>  <p>  The Integrity Unit has been staffed by an average of 22 officers in the grades of Clerical Officer, Executive Officer, Higher Executive Officer and Assistant Principal over the period of March 2019 to March 2022. All officers in the Integrity Unit receive training in various types of fraud relevant to fraudulent passport applications.  This training is conducted by in-house experienced officers and complimented by additional training from external experts.  Some officers concentrate on particular areas within the unit and become very proficient at uncovering certain types of fraud, which is of significant benefit to the work of the unit. In addition, Integrity Unit staff can be assigned to this critical area because of the expertise or experience they bring to their role.  </p></reply>

Over the last two decades, Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PfP has been of significant importance in the development of the peacekeeping capabilities of our Defence Forces and their interoperability with other potential peacekeeping contributing nations. This has allowed the Defence Forces to operate seamlessly alongside other countries on UN peacekeeping operations and other crisis management missions overseas. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s engagement at NATO is tailored in line with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military non-alignment and non-membership of military alliances. There is no membership fee to be part of PfP.  </p><p>In order to manage our partnership with NATO, Ireland maintains an office in a NATO building in Brussels, the rental and maintenance costs of which are directly payable to NATO. </p><p>Separately, Ireland has also made a number of voluntary contributions to NATO Trust Funds which provide capacity-building support to partners such as Ukraine, Jordan, Georgia, Tunisia and Moldova, as well as other UN Troop Contributing Countries. We have provided this support only where the activities supported by the Trust Funds align with Ireland&rsquo;s foreign and security policy. Irish contributions have primarily been in support of disarmament activities. </p><p>In 2021, Ireland made a contribution of &euro;100,000 to the NATO Trust Fund to build the capacity of African UN Troop Contributing Counties by the provision of medical training, communication training and countering improvised explosives device training by NATO experts. A member of the Defence Forces has also been seconded to the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in Uganda to provide expertise as part of the implementation of this wider UN-NATO package. Ireland also provided &euro;50,000 to the Trust Fund for Jordan in 2021.

On 9 March, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a disbursement of US$1.4 billion under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help Ukraine meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war. This follows a US$723 million package of support approved by the World Bank; a &euro;668 million immediate financial support package for Ukraine to be provided by the EIB; and a &euro;2 billion &lsquo;resilience package&rsquo; approved by the EBRD.</p>  <p>  In the absence of full funding by bilateral donors, debt cancellation or debt forgiveness by the IMF risks impairing the Fund's financial integrity which, in turn, could jeopardise future financing for Ukraine and other countries in need. Instead, the IMF&rsquo;s ability to provide debt service relief on its loans to members must be underpinned by donor grants for the repayment of those loans.  For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, the IMF used the donor-supported Catastrophe and Containment Relief Trust to provide debt relief totalling almost US$1 billion to cover debt obligations owed to the Fund between April 2020 and April 2022.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains steadfast and unwavering in its support to Ukraine, including through provision of humanitarian aid, the European Peace Facility package for Ukraine, and the EU's emergency macro-financial assistance operation of &euro;1.2 billion in the form of loans to foster stability in Ukraine.   </p></reply>

The Embassy of Ireland in Singapore, together with our European Union partners has actively monitored the case of Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, including calling on the authorities to halt his execution and to commute his sentence to a non-capital sentence.  We learned with grave concern that Mr. Dharmalingam's death sentence has been upheld by the courts in Singapore on 29 March.  On 30 March, a spokesperson for the EU's High Representative also issued a statement deeply regretting the execution in Singapore of Abdul Kahar bin Othman, who was the first person to executed in Singapore since 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland is unequivocal in its stance against the death penalty and the abolition of capital punishment is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities. My Department regularly conveys our stance on this matter to all countries where the death penalty is still in use. Our active participation at the United Nations Human Rights Council is a particularly important fora in which to raise our concerns regarding human rights. At the 48th Session of the Council, Ireland, as part of the EU27, co-sponsored the biennial resolution on the question of the death penalty which was adopted by vote. The resolution calls on those States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure transparency and respect for human rights. In our intervention at the last Universal Periodic Review of Singapore's human rights record in May 2021 Ireland called on Singapore to consider a moratorium on executions as a step towards abolition.</p>  <p>  I remain deeply concerned about the use of the death penalty and Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Singapore in this regard.   </p></reply>

Due to the pandemic, from March 2020, FBR staff were redeployed to assist in the delivery of essential services, which resulted in a pause in overall FBR processing for a total of 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. Despite this pause, 12,000 FBR applications were processed in 2020, and 7,000 applications were processed in 2021 as FBR staff continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons.</p>  <p>  Given the redeployment of staff from the FBR team to passport checking and other essential services during the pandemic the Passport Service does not have a monthly record of the numbers of staff assigned to FBR entitlement checking during that period. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the FBR Service in November 2021, there have been 17 staff assigned to FBR entitlement checking. Three thousand applications have been processed to date in 2022.  The Entitlement Team are currently processing applications for which supporting documents were received in January 2020.</p>  <p>  The processing of FBR will continue to gradually scale up in line with the recruitment of additional resources. Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. The FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. </p></reply>

All of the cancelled patrol days are due to members of a ship's crew contracting Covid-19.</p><p>The table below provides information on Naval Service patrols from January 2011 up until the end of February 2022.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Fishery Patrol Days</th>       <th>Non-Fishery Patrol Days </th>       <th>Cancelled   Patrol Days - Personnel reasons</th>       <th>Cancelled Patrol days - Mechanical reasons</th>       <th>Total days for year </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>1267</td>       <td>223</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1490</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>1086</td>       <td>172</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>1294</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>1238</td>       <td>111</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>1388</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>856</td>       <td>218</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1081</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>716</td>       <td>452</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>276</td>       <td>1444</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>1068</td>       <td>308</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>104</td>       <td>1480</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1091</td>       <td>317</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>1480</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1076</td>       <td>221</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>154</td>       <td>1504</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1036</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>1155</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>781</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>1088</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>786</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>196</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>1092</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To end February 2022</td>       <td>104</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>136</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The increase in cancelled patrol days in 2021 is mainly due to issues relating to Covid-19 as one of the ships, L&Eacute; Ciara could not go to sea given its inability, due to its size, to implement safely the necessary Covid-19 precautions.  There were also some unforeseen mechanical issues. In particular 47 scheduled patrol days were cancelled in 2021 due to a fire which occurred on board L&Eacute; Niamh in late 2020.  A shortage of suitably qualified and experienced personnel during the period in question was also a factor.</p><p>Notwithstanding the mechanical and staffing challenges being experienced, I am satisfied that the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupil had been availing of a school transport service up to the end of the 2019/20 school year, when Bus &Eacute;ireann were advised by family that the pupil would no longer require a transport service and therefore a ticket was not issued for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  This pupil has been approved for transport to this school for the 2022/23 school year.  Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s local office will liaise with the school authorities to ascertain if a school transport ticket is required for this pupil for the remainder of the 2021/22 school year and if a ticket is required, a ticket will be issued to this pupil.  A school transport ticket will also be arranged to be issued to this pupil in the 2022/23 school year in the Summer of 2022 if required.  </p></reply>

This scheme, which was developed in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, provides for ex gratia payments to be made to those who are eligible to apply and satisfy the criteria as set out in the Terms of Scheme.</p><p>The ex gratia scheme was originally established in 2015 and was put in place to provide those, who had instituted legal proceedings against the State in respect of day school sexual abuse and subsequently discontinued those proceedings following rulings in the domestic courts, with an opportunity to apply for an ex gratia payment.  The Scheme was paused in 2019 following a report from retired High Court Judge Iarfhlaith O&rsquo;Neill who, as Independent Assessor, reviewed a number of unsuccessful applications to the Scheme and was of the view that the criteria to qualify for a payment were too restrictive for this group of applicants.  The revised scheme opened for applications on 21 July 2021.</p><p>Ireland is committed to fulfilling its obligations in implementing the ECtHR ruling.  This means that the revised scheme is designed, first and foremost, to provide a remedy to those who had issued and discontinued their proceedings against the State prior to the ECtHR ruling in <i>O'Keeffe v Ireland</i>and who did not receive a payment under the 2015 Scheme.  However, the revised scheme goes beyond that group in that all others who issued legal proceedings against the State at a later date and up to 1 July 2021, whether they are still in being, were discontinued at any point, or who had settled with the State, may also apply for an award.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also mean a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  As outlined on the information issued at the time of the announcement, there is an appeals process. Schools will have an opportunity to have that decision reviewed. Details of how to make an appeal are on my Department&rsquo;s website: www.gov.ie/en/circular/7e7ca-deis-identification-2022-appeals-process-for-schools/</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p>  <p>  The most recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that over 76% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level have stable or decreasing projected enrolments for the period to 2025, whereas some 88% of the school planning areas at post-primary level are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2028, with most expected to reach a peak in the next two or three years.

Information is being kept up to date on www.gov.ie/Ukraine in English, Ukrainian and Russian. Children aged between 4 and 18 will be supported to access public primary or post-primary education.</p><p>Guidance has issued to schools on supporting students from Ukraine that enquire about enrolling. Where children of school-going age have arrived and require access to the school system, schools that have capacity locally will welcome those children in the usual way.  The information provided to schools informed them on how to respond if they don&rsquo;t have capacity in their school, so that we can make accessing a school as easy as possible for these families.  </p><p>My Department has set up a helpline and email address for Principals of schools where there is additional demand for places, details of which have been communicated to schools. </p><p>My Department has also established Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT) to support the needs of children from Ukraine arriving in Ireland. These teams will be hosted by the 16 regional Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and will be staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel working closely together to ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for children from Ukraine. </p><p>The REALT will support existing services and co-ordinate the following work areas:</p><p>- Align current school capacity with the placement of Ukrainian families, as much as possible.</p><p>- Identify additional capacity within their geographic areas to prepare for situations where demand may exceed available school capacity, and work with the Department and other organisations as necessary with a view to making this additional capacity available. </p><p>- Assist schools and families with accessing information on school places for children from Ukraine who have moved into the area.</p><p>- Assist schools and families with accessing resources and supports for additional capacity, wellbeing, language and educational needs. </p><p>- Assist with work in the area of staff supply, including where required, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) tutors who would assist with the English language needs of Ukrainian children, young people and their parents/guardians. </p><p>- Liaison with other local co-ordinating structures that may be established to coordinate the delivery of public services for families from Ukraine, including Community Response Fora.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. </p><p>These new schools include: </p><p>- A3 BER standard </p><p>- Fully evaluated natural ventilation strategy to all spaces</p><p>- 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations even thought it was designed pre 2019</p><p>- 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics</p><p>-Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable biomass heat to the school under the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), as the heat as a service area matures in Ireland. SSRH is a government funded initiative designed to increase the energy generated from renewable sources in the heat sector.</p><p>- A system that automatically shuts down power to nonessential electrical power outlets when the school is closed (eliminating energy use out of hours) </p><p>- Infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging </p><p>-Rainwater harvesting</p><p>- CO<sub>2</sub>monitors </p><p>- Excellent daylight </p><p>- Internal and external LED lighting </p><p>- Variable speed pumping </p><p>- Building Management System control of energy including energy metering </p><p>- Zone and individual room heating control </p><p>- Educational signage draws attention to environmental aspects of design </p><p>- Support will be offered to the school in terms of understanding energy usage and optimising controls.</p><p>The A3 BER in schools is achieved using a hybrid approach of: </p><p>- Maximising nature through passive solar design, quality daylighting and quality ventilation.</p><p>- Enhanced technologies including LED lighting and controls with daylight and absence detection, digital individual room heating controls, maximum water efficiency and rainwater harvesting systems, high quality air tightness and photovoltaic panels to produce an electrical renewable energy.  </p><p>- Schools have a system that automatically shuts down power to nonessential electrical power outlets when a school is closed (eliminating energy use out of hours). </p><p>In the interest of sustainability, the potential of renewables is maximised in school design, whilst ensuring that renewable applications are properly suited to needs and reflective of school opening hours and school holiday periods. It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s approach is also based on future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a just transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents to include:</p><p>- Direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems, in series at a base level, with controls.</p><p>- Optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, (note further enhancement of the external building fabric will result in overheating in Spring and Autumn, requiring air conditioning).</p><p>- Low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems.  </p><p>- Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable heat to schools using biomass boilers, with provision for the ESCO to provide, operate and maintain the boiler plant system and maximise the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.</p><p>The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. </p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. </p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.</p><p>The Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. A deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.  </p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme. </p><p>The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects. </p><p>The schools for the 2022 programme are:</p><p>- Ennis Community College</p><p>- Bishopstown Community School </p><p>- St Marys Secondary School Killester </p><p>- Our Lady of Consolation Killester </p><p>- Scoil Mhuire NS Abbeyleix  </p><p>- St Annes Primary school, Tallaght</p><p>The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies. </p><p>The Department recognises that transition to full decarbonisation raises the bar even higher in terms of requirements with feedback from our pathfinder projects as noted above indicating a greater depth of challenges at a significantly enhanced cost for primary and post primary schools. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published in January this year actions the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by end of 2022.</p><p>Work is ongoing on decarbonisation options for new schools with a focus on the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building and establishing the trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings while ensuring no delays to school accommodation delivery.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>The total budget for the Pathfinder programme of works from 2017 - 2022 is &euro;78m.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes (primary and post-primary), providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. Budget 2022 also provides for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places from September next. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. Both my Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that Minister Foley and I recently announced the establishment of a new special school in Cork together with an update on the expansion of existing special class and special school capacity in Cork and Dublin.</p><p>In line with the demographics and as part of forward planning, it is envisaged that special classes will be required at most, if not all, post-primary schools.  </p><p>A range of measures to meet additional SEN capacity demands have already been put in place including the utilisation of spare capacity in existing schools and delivery of additional SEN capacity within the scope of existing building projects. </p><p>Additionally, it is general practice to include a SEN Base in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless exceptional local circumstances indicate that it will not be required. The extent of provision made at these schools is informed by the level of demand in the area as well as the size of the school. </p><p>My Department, together with the NCSE, is monitoring the availability of places for students with special educational needs throughout the country as a priority issue and will continue to work with relevant stakeholders to ensure a supply of placements coming on stream to meet emerging demand.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children and young people are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. The enrolment policy of individual schools takes account of the school's own assessment of school capacity which is influenced by each school's own characteristics.</p>  <p>  The Department has data on potential capacity and under/over subscription at individual schools from its National Inventory of School Capacity based on schools&rsquo; annual enrolment returns, and utilises its Geographic Information System to facilitate spatial analysis of this and other data. On a national level, total primary enrolments peaked in 2018 and have been reducing since.  The net overall reduction in primary enrolments by 2022/23 was projected to be in the order of 25,000 pupils.  At post-primary level, demographics are generally continuing on an upward trend.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, at both primary and post-primary level there are significant variances in available capacity at local and regional level across the country, in both rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  I would also advise the Deputy that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area.</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area.</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department proactively engages with relevant school authorities to establish the true extent of enrolment pressures.  Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train.</p></reply>

Trauma informed approaches may form part of case work or part of the support and development work and NEPS psychologists work to build teacher capacity in this area. NEPS&rsquo; Support and Development work involves the provision of applied psychology services for teachers and school communities to build and maximise their capacity to respond to the needs of all students and those with particular needs. This includes trauma informed education. These professional learning activities may include the provision of training/formal professional learning opportunities including training in the delivery of evidence-informed approaches and early intervention, and working with school communities to develop supportive school structures and processes.  These activities are not recorded in a format that would allow the precise data sought by the Deputy to be reported. </p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists have engaged in extensive national training in the area of trauma in recent years to inform their practice and the development of professional learning opportunities for school staff.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. </p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36/2020 and 51/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. The Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.</p>  <p>  The Department is satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

My Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of continuing professional development and supports for teachers and principals. </p>  <p>  My Department ensures that a range of high-quality models of CPD is provided to teachers and school leaders through it's support services, (such as the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT)), the national network of Education Centres and appropriate groups, bodies and institutions who are empowered to design, develop and deliver CPD programmes. It is important also to ensure that valuable teacher student contact time is protected.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Public Sector Agreement 2010-2014 (The &ldquo;Croke Park Agreement&rdquo;) teachers were required to work additional hours (the &ldquo;Croke Park hours&rdquo; - 33 Post Primary/36 Primary).  A central purpose of these hours is to provide for certain essential activities, including CPD,  without reducing tuition time and closing schools. The use and timing of these hours was set out in Circular 0025/2011.  </p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of school management to identify, agree, and assign the usage of the Croke Park hours based on the needs of their individual school. It is expected there will be consultation at the school level on the use of the hours, but ultimately that is a decision for school management.</p>  <p>  The school may consider facilitating the training using their Croke Park Hours in separate blocks, one before the end of this school year and the other early in the 2022/23 school year. This may allow the school to use their Croke Park hours to complete the CPD programme while not impacting on planning and meetings.</p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) recognises the importance of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches in building safe and connected schools and trauma informed practice is part of the normal day to day work of the educational psychologists. Trauma informed approaches may form part of case work or part of the support and development work and NEPS psychologists work to build teacher capacity in this area. NEPS&rsquo; Support and Development work involves the provision of applied psychology services for teachers and school communities to build and maximise their capacity to respond to the needs of all students and those with particular needs. This includes trauma informed education. These professional learning activities may include the provision of training/formal professional learning opportunities including training in the delivery of evidence-informed approaches and early intervention, and working with school communities to develop supportive school structures and processes.</p>  <p>  NEPS has developed a series of Wellbeing and Resilience in Schools webinars, exploring the use of whole-school, compassionate and trauma-informed approaches to build safe and connected schools drawing on the existing practice of psychologists in this area. The &ldquo;Stress Factor&rdquo; the first webinar in the series for all school staff will be available to all primary and post primary schools after Easter in collaboration with the Education Centre network.  </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p><p>My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas including Dun Laoighre and Sallynooggin_Killiney_DLR</p><p>However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area.</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area.</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils.</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Dun Laoighre and Sallynooggin_Killiney_DLR to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in certain areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. The current status of both large-scale projects and projects under the Additional Accommodation scheme being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The list of post primary schools in the Dun Laoighre and Sallynooggin_Killiney_DLR school planning areas are as follows:</p><p>Dun Laoighre</p><p>- 60050E Oatlands College Christian Brothers</p><p>- 60081P Rockford Manor Secondary School CEIST</p><p>- 60130C Loreto Abbey Secondary School ETB</p><p>- 60180R Christian Brothers College Christian Brothers</p><p>- 81001I Newpark Comprehensive School Church Of Ireland</p><p>Sallynooggin_Killiney_DLR</p><p>- 60090Q Rathdown School &ndash; Patron Christian Brothers</p><p>- 60092U  Clonkeen College Patron -ERST</p><p>- 60240J Loreto College Foxrock &ndash; Patron ETB</p><p>- 60260P St Joseph Of Cluny Secondary School Le Ch&eacute;ile Trust</p><p>- 60262T St Laurence College Le Ch&eacute;ile Trust</p><p>- 91310E Cabinteely Community School ETB</p><p>- 91330K Holy Child Community School Le Ch&eacute;ile Trust</p><p>The following schools have been approved for capital funding in respect additional capacity:</p><p>- 60050E Oatlands College Christian Brothers. A project is ongoing for 2 x 15m2 resource rooms.</p><p>- 91310E Cabinteely Community School ETB. A project is ongoing for 2 classroom SEN Base.</p><p>- 60262T St Laurence College Le Ch&eacute;ile Trust. A new project has been approved for 3 Classroom SEN Base, 1 Music Room, 1 Engineering room and prep area and the conversion of existing 100m&sup2; ASD room to Textiles room.</p><p>The planned establishment of a new post-primary school in 2021 to serve the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR/Cherrywood school planning area was announced in 2018.  Further analysis has since been conducted on the necessity for the establishment of a new school in this planning area, taking into account a number of factors, including the pace of delivery of the expected additional residential development in the school planning areas, associated enrolments and the capacity in existing schools in the areas. My Department is satisfied that demand in the Sallynoggin_Killiney_DLR/Cherrywood school planning area can be accommodated at present by the existing and growing schools in this area. As a result, the establishment of the planned new school has been deferred. </p></reply>

The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special education needs over the summer holidays.  With regard to the range of years referred to by the Deputy, Special schools and schools with special classes were permitted to run the school-based programme over the years 2017-2020 inclusive. </p><p>In 2020 a significantly expanded summer programme was established as a response to COVID-19 with the eligibility criteria widened to include approximately 9,000 additional children with complex needs. </p><p>The programme aims were to ensure, in so far as possible, that these children could reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  As part of this expansion, the Department&rsquo;s existing Literacy and Numeracy camps for DEIS Primary Band 1 schools was included in the Summer Programme and extended to all DEIS Primary schools. Furthermore, DEIS post-primary schools were given the option of running an inclusion programme for the first time.  </p><p>In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the government announced a further expanded to the Summer Programme.  Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a 100% increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.  The range of programmes on offer built on the success of the expanded programmes that ran in 2020 and incorporated feedback from education stakeholders.  For the first time, all primary schools were given the opportunity to run a 2-3 week inclusion programme, an expansion to all post-primary schools that had been previously only been available in DEIS post-primary schools in 2020.  In addition, enhanced supports provided included measures to reduce the administrative burden, provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes, earlier payment to school staff and provision to recruit newly qualified teachers to work on the programme. </p><p>My Department is currently at an advanced stage of planning for the 2022 summer programme. Details of the programme will published as soon as possible.</p><p>Due to the different structures of July Provision and the Summer Programme, the information as requested by the Deputy is broken down to cover the years 2017-2020 and 2021 for the primary and post primary programmes,  as well as a separate breakdown of the DEIS Literacy and Numeracy/Campai Samhraidh over the period 2017-2021.</p><p><b><i>1. 2017-2020 </i></b></p><p>1a Schools offering the Special Class and Special School Programme <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>41</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Yearly   Totals</td>       <td>219</td>       <td>239</td>       <td>232</td>       <td>254<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>1b 2020 &ndash; DEIS Post Primary Schools offering the Inclusion Programme</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Number of Schools</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>72<br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b><i>2. 2021</i></b></p><p><b>2a.

The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to: </p><p>- Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century </p><p>- Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system</p><p>- Embed wellbeing and reduce student stress levels</p><p>The reforms I announced will include initiatives to spread the assessment load for students and do so in a way that enhances student wellbeing. In future years, I want to see language Oral examinations and the Music practical performance taking place during the first week of the Easter break of 6th year, in similar fashion to the Easter 2022 arrangements I announced last December. I have asked the State Examinations Commission (SEC) to advise me on the implementation of these changes on a permanent basis following an evaluation of the arrangements in 2022 by the SEC.</p><p>In 2022, as in 2021, the Leaving Certificate Oral examinations and the Music Practical Performance are scheduled to take place outside school time during the Easter period. This protects the school year and educational provision to students, reduces disruption, minimises substitution requirements and therefore eases current teacher supply challenges in this area. </p><p>These arrangements can also be managed at school level to manage any undue burden on individual students who may be taking Irish, more than one Modern Foreign Language and Music. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services to be provided by external suppliers in line with national and EU procurement legislation and this includes services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme.  Compliant tenders are evaluated against published award criteria. Successful tenderers are awarded a contract for up to five years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further.  </p>  <p>  Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.</p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are at unprecedented levels.</p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. </p>  <p>  The State currently spends in excess of 25% of its annual education and training budget (&euro;9.2 Billion) on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021/2022 school year.  Of these 1,524 special classes are in primary schools. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 announced details of &euro;9.2 billion in funding for education and includes funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022) to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022. This represents an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.  </p>  <p>  This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9,740 teachers were allocated.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides for the creation 980 new teaching posts in special education.  This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes; students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special school places and the needs of new and developing schools. </p>  <p>  The new allocation is broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  - 620 of the new posts will provide additional support for children attending mainstream classes including new and  expanding schools</p>  <p>  - 360 posts will facilitate the opening of 287 new special classes providing over 1,700 new places in 2022 and 140 new special school places</p>  <p>  A new model for allocating special education teachers in respect of students with special needs enrolled in mainstream classes was introduced in 2017.  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  The profile of each school takes account of enrolments and a number of other factors that are considered to be indicative of the level of need in each school. There is a commitment to update profiles on a regular basis with the last update being for the 2019/20 school. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a provision for schools to seek additionality through the Exceptional Needs Review process if there is a significant change in their level of need in between profile updates.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.</p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools.</p>  <p>  I have asked the NCSE to engage directly with the school in question.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,025,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p><p>I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties than can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy. I have recently met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss their proposal in detail. </p><p>Following the meeting I have asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland and to explore options to help alleviate these issues. Further meetings will be arranged once this exploratory work has been concluded.</p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.</p><p>It is also important to note that there are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act. </p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<b></b></p></reply>

Amongst the class B contributors are permanent and pensionable civil servants and Garda&iacute;, the class C contributors are commissioned army officers and members of the army nursing service and the class D contributors include permanent and pensionable employees in the public service other than those insured at classes B and C.  All civil and public servants recruited from 6 April 1995 pay social insurance at the standard class A rate.  </p>  <p>  Prior to 6 April 1995, civil and public servants did not have access to the full range of social insurance benefits as their terms of employment protected them against the main contingencies of illness and old age, and the risk of unemployment was not considered a factor due to the nature of their employment.</p>  <p>  Consequently, such contributors pay less in social insurance contributions in return for fewer social insurance benefits.  For example, class D contributors currently pay a contribution at the rate of 0.9% on their weekly earnings up to &euro;1,443 and 4% on weekly earnings over that amount and their employers pay a contribution of 2.35% on all employee earnings.  Class D contributors are currently entitled to widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardian's payment (contributory), occupational injuries benefits, parent's benefit and carer's benefit.</p>  <p>  In contrast, civil and public servants recruited from 6 April 1995 pay a class A social insurance contribution of 4% on their weekly earnings and their employers pay a contribution of 8.8% where employees&rsquo; weekly earnings are &euro;410 or less and 11.05% where their employees&rsquo; weekly earnings exceed &euro;410.

Consultations with a CWO are available via phone at our offices and a direct home visit appointment can be arranged depending on the customer&rsquo;s needs.  All applications for assistance are dealt with promptly by my officials.  </p><p>This change is a significant enhancement to the service offered to customers as it means that those who require community welfare assistance no longer need to visit an outreach location or wait to make a claim or wait to access the service.  The initiatives that I have put in place continue to ensure that the service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This means that people arriving from Ukraine under the Temporary Directive have been granted the status to avail of income supports from my Department. </p><p>The priority for my Department is the allocation of PPSNs and the provision of immediate financial supports.  A fast-track approach in processing these supports has been put in place which includes a simplified decision-making process and quick processing of PPSNs to allow access to public services.  People are eligible for financial support initially under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme and will be deemed to have satisfied the Habitual Residence Condition and their means are being assessed as nil.

In addition to these primary payments, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p><p>The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  </p><p>Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment from my Department.  Any decision to allow those who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the Living Alone Increase - and thereby establish it as a scheme - would have budgetary and administrative consequences and would have to be considered in the context of Budget negotiations.  </p><p>PRSI Class D provides social insurance coverage for permanent and pensionable employees in the public service, other than those who were recruited after 6 April, 1995, doctors and dentists employed in the civil service, Garda&iacute;, commissioned army officers and members of the army nursing service.  Public servants recruited on or after 6 April 1995 are liable to pay PRSI contributions at the ordinary Class A contribution. </p><p>The contributions payable by an employee at the modified rate of contribution determines the range of benefits and pensions towards which these contributors can build up entitlement.  Subject to having the required number of PRSI contributions, employees who paid Class D contributions accrued entitlement to the following payments:</p><p>a) Carer&rsquo;s Benefit</p><p>b) Guardian&rsquo;s Payment Contributory</p><p>c) Occupational Injuries Benefits</p><p>d) Parent&rsquo;s Benefit</p><p>e) Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This information includes personal details supplied on the application form by the child&rsquo;s parent / guardian; details of the additional care and attention required by the child as outlined by the parent / guardian and medical details provided by the child&rsquo;s GP or specialist.  Any additional information the parent/guardian considers relevant to the application is also reviewed (this could include consultant&rsquo;s reports, reports from a community health doctor, a copy of the needs assessment carried out by the HSE etc.).</p>  <p>  Eligibility is determined primarily by reference to the degree of additional care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability involved.  </p>  <p>  The percentage of any age cohort who are ultimately deemed qualified over any particular period of time will vary due to a number of factors, including the volumes of applications relating to that age group and the ability of the child, as they get older, to better cope with their disability without substantial additional care for another person. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that the same assessment criteria is applied to all applications irrespective of the age of child concerned. </p></reply>

Those who qualify for the payment are not required to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work which is generally the case for recipients of jobseeker payments.</p>  <p>  The benefit payment, which is not means tested, is provided under the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (Self-Employed) social insurance schemes in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.  </p>  <p>  One of the qualifying conditions for Benefit Payment for 65 year Olds is that a person must no longer be engaged in employment or self- employment.  However, customers may continue to work in subsidiary employment while in receipt of Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds, provided that the remuneration or profit from the occupation does not exceed &euro;7,500 per annum or &euro;144 on a weekly basis.  Subsidiary employment is defined as work that could have been done while a person was in full-time employment and outside their normal working hours.  Where a person has more than 117 contributions in the 3 years prior to becoming unemployed there is no income limit applied. </p>  <p>  A person with investment income subject to PRSI Class K over &euro;7,500 per year would not be eligible to any benefit payment from my Department.</p>  <p>  Class S Self-employed contributors pay PRSI on a wide variety of self-employment income.  These contributions help to ensure that individuals qualify for social welfare benefits, including pensions.  The qualifying conditions for Jobseekers Benefit (Self-Employed) include the requirement that a person has completely ceased self-employment.  For that reason, individuals who continue to pay Class S PRSI on a variety of income sources would not satisfy the conditions for Benefit Payment for 65 year olds as they are not regarded as having ceased self-employment; they continue to pay Class S PRSI and are to be regarded as being in insurable self-employment. </p>  <p>  A person with distributions from an Annual Retirement Fund of over &euro;7,500 per year would not qualify for the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds as they would be deemed to be in insurable employment. </p>  <p>  Any person aged 65 who does not qualify for the benefit payment may apply for the means tested Jobseekers Allowance.  The maximum rate of payment is also aligned with the weekly rate of payment for the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds, which is &euro;208 and increased allowances are paid for qualifying adult and child dependents.  A person can also be engaged in limited employment and may still qualify for a jobseeker's allowance payment subject to satisfying the scheme conditionality. </p>  <p>  The issue regarding Class S PRSI contributions arising solely from personal pensions has been raised with my Department and the matter is under consideration.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  To receive the fuel allowance payment an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and the household composition test. This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and those who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 and with immediate effect the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of Contributory State Pension representing a 20% increase and enabling more people to qualify for this support. </p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance operates as part of an overall system of social protection supports which provides assistance payments based on a system of means testing.  The means test ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash, property - other than the family home - and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure commitments or income tax circumstances. </p>  <p>  For most social assistance payments, deductions from gross income are permitted in the case of PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses. </p>  <p>  If net rather than gross income was assessed for Fuel Allowance, it would mean that changes in tax rates or tax reliefs could change the claimant&rsquo;s entitlement.  In addition, to deduct outgoings such as mortgage or rent payments would significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment.  It would also have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Core Funding aims to offer better financial sustainability to providers in return for a cultural shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State that reflects the public good dimension of ELC and SAC.</p><p>On 7th March I announced the rates and values for the Core Funding, and launched the online Ready Reckoner tool. The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. </p><p>Where providers are experiencing difficulties completing the Ready Reckoner, I would encourage them to engage with their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) who can provide support. </p><p>The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity - opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million).  The rationale for distributing Core Funding based on capacity is that capacity encompasses the primary characteristics that determine the service's costs of delivery. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity will support sustainability and stability for services, since they will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance.  </p><p>In addition to the &euro;183 million allocated on the basis of capacity, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. </p><p>Services whose provision is led by a graduate will receive this Graduate Premium, on top of their other funding. The Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding is paid as a top up on the number of hours of provision that is led by a graduate with a relevant qualification and three years' experience. The Graduate Manager Premium is paid as a top up on the number of hours of operation of a service whose manager is a graduate with a relevant qualification. An ELC Graduate Manager who also works as a Lead Educator can only attract one graduate premium. </p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP), with an increased allocation, from September 2022.</p><p>The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through Core Funding. It is important to state that no service will lose out because of Core Funding.</p><p>My Department has issued a funding guarantee to providers. All services will receive at least the same level of funding in Core Funding as they received from higher capitation and PSP in the 2021/22 programme year, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same</p><p>Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services, &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, substantially in excess of the average staffing costs for this type of provision.</p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector and that this additional investment is best allocated by linking the quantum of funding to services with their underlying costs of delivery. </p><p>This is the start of a multi-annual investment plan and is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the <i>First 5</i>target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. <i>First 5</i>and Core Funding recognise that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality ELC. Strong international evidence shows that children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model.</p></reply>

The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level.</p><p>- An <b>income-related subsidy</b>is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I announced two changes to the NCS which will result in more parents getting more subsidised hours of early learning and childcare in Tulsa registered services.</p><p>- The universal subsidy will be made available to all families with children under 15 years of age. </p><p>- There will be a change in the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to income-related subsidised NCS hours. This means that the full awarded subsidised NCS hours will be available regardless of whether children are in pre-school or school.</p><p>In addition, a new Core Funding stream will be introduced for ELC and SAC services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. Core Funding will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from the September 2021 rates. This means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS and ECCE Pre-school Programme, will be felt by parents.</p><p>Providers who do increase their fees will be required to revert to September 2021 levels on or before September 2022 in order to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a direct role in the provision of placements.</p><p>From a nursing and midwifery perspective, there are Local Joint Working Groups (LJWGs) in place across the country aligned to each HEI/University and the associated healthcare partner area. These LJWGs provide the governance for the undergraduate nursing and midwifery training and are composed of representatives from both HEIs/Universities and health service. The LJWGs meet regularly throughout the year and include discussions/negotiations on capacity to increase student intake. If agreement is reached between the partners to increase the intake, the information is submitted to the Higher Education Authority. The HEA and my Department will link with the DoH regarding the proposed increase in student intake. The Department of Health will subsequently liaise with the HSE in relation to required additional supports such as Clinical Placement Co-ordinators. In parallel, exercises are ongoing at LJWG level to source and develop new clinical sites to further enhance the capacity to accommodate additional students.</p><p>In the recently published report of the Expert Review Body on Nursing and Midwifery (2022), it is recognised that the projected increase in nursing and midwifery student numbers will require planning in relation to academic, clinical staffing and placements resources.</p><p>In relation to the Health and Social Care Professions, the HSE is required to facilitate practice education under<i>Section 7 (4)</i>the Health Act 2004.</p><p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and related issues, the HSE has identified critical shortages in practice placements for Health and Social Care Professional students.  The focus of the HSE is on supporting practice placement for the domestic supply.</p><p>The Health and Social Care Professional education programmes report significant challenges in securing sufficient practice placements for Health and Social Care Professional entry to practice programmes, without which Health and Social Care Professional students cannot complete their programmes, graduate and join the workforce.  </p><p>The HSE is working with key stakeholders to identify potential solutions and the resources required to address issues relating to sufficient supply of practice placements for Health and Social Care Professionals.  The priority of the HSE is to work with the Higher Education Institutes to enable the placements required for the progression of students through their educational programmes and to enable completion, graduation, and registration of the final year students to ensure timely supply of health and Social Care Professionals into the workforce.</p><p>My officials are actively engaging with the Department of Health on determining the medium and long term skills needs of the healthcare services, and the role which the further and higher education sector can play in meeting those skills needs.

The separate strand for international protection applicants who have been in the asylum process for a minimum of two years opened a week later on 7 February 2022.</p><p>There has been a very positive level of engagement with the scheme since it opened, with approximately 5,000 applications made to date to the two strands.  </p><p>My Department committed to making the online application process as simple and as straightforward as possible and because of this is now in a position to issue the first positive decisions just two months in.  Around 250 positive decisions have issued under the two strands in recent days and processing of all other applications remains ongoing. </p><p>Permission letters have started to arrive in homes across the country with life changing news for those receiving them and their families. I want to congratulate everyone who has received a letter and to thank them for trusting us and coming forward to regularise their position in the State.  </p><p>  This is just the start and we will see more decisions and permissions issuing in the coming weeks.</p><p>It is very important that people who are eligible do not miss out on the opportunity to apply to this scheme. To build on the early momentum and continue raising awareness of the scheme, my Department will run a targeted communications campaign in the coming weeks to reach out to migrant communities likely to benefit from the scheme to encourage them to consider applying.</p><p>My Department is also continuing to engage with the NGO community and other stakeholders who have played and will continue to play a key role in building confidence in the scheme among the more vulnerable members of those migrant communities. I hope seeing these first positive decisions issuing will encourage more people to apply for what is truly a once-in-a-generation opportunity to regularise their status in the State.</p><p>I encourage all undocumented migrants who are eligible to apply for the main scheme to do so before the closing date of 31 July 2022. Applications can be made online at: inisonline.jahs.ie.</p><p>  Further details regarding the qualifying criteria, the required documentation, and how to apply for the scheme are available on my Department's immigration website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/regularisation-of-long-term-undocumented-migrant-scheme.  </p><p>  The International Protection Office of my Department has written to approximately 4,000 potentially eligible applicants inviting them to apply.  Over 1,300 people from this cohort have applied so far. This strand of the scheme is open for applications until 7 August 2022.

The Irish Prison Service carries out cell occupancy census at regular intervals and the data from the latest published cell occupancy census carried out by the Service indicates that 54% of prisoners in custody are accommodated in single cell accommodation.</p>  <p>  The provision of single cell accommodation for all prisoners is not currently feasible due to the existing capacity within the prison estate, and current levels of committals.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that there are approximately 3,300 usable cells in the estate with approximately 3,980 people in custody at any point in time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that some prisoners are accommodated in multi-occupancy cells for reasons other than capacity and some prisoners, at committal stage, indicate a preference to share a cell with another person who may be known to them.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that all prisoners are assessed by prison management on committal with regard to their suitability for sharing a cell.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that Government continues to invest in the capital development of the prison estate. Later this year, the reopening of the Training in Mountjoy unit will provide an additional 96 spaces. The opening of new male accommodation in Limerick in late 2022 will result in an additional 90 prisoner cell spaces being available and the completion of a new standalone female prison currently underway in Limerick prison will provide 40 new female cell spaces later this year.</p>  <p>  The need to ensure the continued availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will be central to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023, against the background of the work underway as part of the Programme for Government commitment to develop policies and proposals to review policy options for prison and penal reform, including the effective and appropriate use of non-custodial sanctions.</p></reply>

The Taskforce is independently chaired by former Minister of State Kathleen Lynch. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce already had nine plenary meetings and has established three subgroups on  diversion,  capacity issues in the Prison Service and National Forensic Mental Health Services, and community issues, including care after release.  </p>  <p>  Each of the subgroups comprises of relevant experts, chaired by high ranking officials from the criminal justice sector, with the health leads represented and contributing to all. Each of these groups have met on at least ten occasions.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has engaged with a large number of relevant bodies and civil society actors, including meeting with the Mental Health Commission on 2 December 2021 and, more recently, with the Chairperson of the National Prison Visiting Committees Chairpersons Group and with the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has also received presentations from relevant stakeholders including the Mental Health Commission, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and Crowe Consulting on the comprehensive Health Needs Assessment embarked on by the Prison Service.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce submitted its interim report to myself and my colleague the Minister for Health on 22 November 2021. I also met the group before Christmas to get an update on their work. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the work of the Taskforce is continuing apace with the aim of finalising a report, including a high level implementation plan assigning responsibility and timelines for the implementation of its recommendations, early in Quarter 2.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work of the Task Force, this commitment is reflected in the provision of over &euro;2 million in additional funding for the Prison Service to improve mental health services under Budget 2022. This includes just over &euro;1 million for psychologists and specialist mental health nurses in prisons who can work with prisoners to address mental health issues for all categories of offender. </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding placement of these additional psychologists are currently being considered and will be based on the mental health needs and overall psychologist-to-prisoner ratio across the estate.  To this end, it is intended to recruit additional psychologists throughout 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, I understand that this year, the Prison Service intends to increase the mental health qualifications and skills within the Service's nursing workforce through recruitment, training and development.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service continues to work to enhance and improve its level of medical service delivery to prisoners.  The Service has embarked on a comprehensive Health Needs Assessment (HNA) to examine the broad range of health care services that are provided across the entire prison estate.

The Kildare DPSU referenced by the Deputy commenced operations in September 2020. </p><p>There is now a Divisional Protective Services Unit (DPSU) established in every Garda division across the country. This ensures that vulnerable victims of crimes, such as domestic abuse and sexual violence, presenting to Garda&iacute; are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance. This specialisation ensures that when victims of domestic and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, at perhaps their most vulnerable moment, they are met with professional and expert assistance.</p><p>  Under Budget 2022, an additional &euro;1m is being provided to AGS to refurbish and upgrade the Divisional Protective Service Units. This commitment will allow us to better support and protect vulnerable victims.</p><p>In addition, the Divisional Victim Service Offices (DVSO) and front line Garda&iacute; are also resources available to respond to domestic violence and support victims.</p><p>I was recently in contact with the Garda authorities to seek information on matters related to domestic violence training for the Service, both for those officers attached to DPSUs and to members generally. I thought it might also be useful to share that information in this reply as I know this is an area the Deputy is deeply invested in. </p><p>I am informed that significant investment in training for addressing instances of domestic violence and supporting victims has, and is, being made.</p><p>  I am advised that in 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na devised mandatory online training for its personnel in the area of Domestic Abuse. This is a comprehensive training package consisting of instructor led videos presented by subject matter experts from the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB).  It also includes periodic knowledge checks and supporting materials.  Furthermore, live webinar virtual classroom sessions in relation to the Domestic Abuse Risk Evaluation Training is currently being rolled out to Garda personnel on a phased basis, hosted by subject matter experts from GNPSB. </p><p>  A separate online course, which consists of instructor led demonstration videos on the correct use of PULSE in dealing with Domestic Violence Orders has also been launched.  </p><p>In addition, new content has been included on the Foundation Training Programme with a view to enhancing the learning for Garda Probationers during the course of their training.</p><p>While those assigned to the DPSU already receive specialist training, a review of this is currently underway and with a view to redeveloping the DPSU training to ensure an even more customised, fit-for-purpose and victim-centric training course is delivered to all DPSU members from Detective Garda to Detective Inspector.  </p><p>  To this end GNPSB have completed a nationwide canvass with a view to determining training needs and it has been established that there are 392 members of Garda, Sergeant and Inspector rank attached to Divisional Protective Services Units nationwide. Training was delivered in 5 individual modules titled as follows:1. Sexual Crime;2. Online Child Exploitation;3. Domestic Abuse;4. Human Trafficking and Victims;5. Court Process.</p><p>  The initial position in respect of the DPSU training requirement, is that anyone who has not completed all five modules of this training will be required to undertake the new training programme that will be ready for delivery by Q2, 2022. </p><p>  The proposed training programme is expected to enhance the skills of DPSU members, to ensure that each one can carry out the full range of specialist tasks frequently necessitated within their roles.</p><p>On foot of the Deputy's question, I contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek the specific information sought on the number of cases that the Kildare Protective Services Unit has dealt with in 2021 and to date in 2022. That information is presented in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Type </th>       <th>Jan to  Dec. 2021  (12 month period) </th>       <th>Jan 2022 to 30 March 2022  (3 month period to present) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DPSU Investigation </td>       <td>171 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>171 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Taskforce is independently chaired by former Minister of State Kathleen Lynch. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce already had nine plenary meetings and has established three subgroups on  diversion,  capacity issues in the Prison Service and National Forensic Mental Health Services, and community issues, including care after release. </p>  <p>  Each of the subgroups comprises of relevant experts, chaired by high ranking officials from the criminal justice sector, with the health leads represented and contributing to all. Each of these groups have met on at least ten occasions.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has engaged with a large number of relevant bodies and civil society actors, including meeting with the Mental Health Commission on 2 December 2021 and, more recently, met with the Chairperson of the National Prison Visiting Committees Chairpersons Group and with the Inspector of Prisons.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has also received presentations from relevant stakeholders including the Mental Health Commission, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and Crowe Consulting on the comprehensive Health Needs Assessment embarked on by the Prison Service.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce submitted its interim report to myself and my colleague the Minister for Health on 22 November 2021. I also met the group before Christmas to get an update on their work. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the work of the Taskforce is continuing apace and the aim is to finalise a report, including a high level implementation plan assigning responsibility and timelines for its recommendations, in early Quarter 2.</p></reply>

My officials have recently written to the applicant advising them of the current status of their application.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.</p></reply>

The Inspector's key role is to carry out regular inspections of prisons. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Section 31 of the Prisons Act 2007 provides that the Inspector of Prisons can at any time enter any prison or any part of a prison, request and obtain from the Governor a copy of any books, records, other documents kept in the prison. </p>  <p>  Governors, prison officers, other persons employed in prisons and prisoners are required by law, in as far as reasonably practicable, to comply with any request for information from the Inspector as they perform their functions. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service actively encourages prisoners at all times to engage with the independent bodies making inspections of prisons including the Inspector of Prison, the Prison Visiting Committees and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane Treatment. To assist prisoners in this regard, the Prison Service provides prisoners with information on these bodies via the Prisoner Information Booklet.</p>  <p>  In 2021, in response to the pandemic, and the need to monitor the situation within prisons for prisoners and staff, the Inspector of Prisons suspended her planned 2021 general inspection programme and instead embarked on a Covid-19 focused inspection schedule, designed to provide a human rights-based assessment of the response of the Prison Service to the pandemic.  Throughout the pandemic the Prison Service continued to facilitate access to prisons and prisoners for those organisations with a statutory role such as the Office of the Inspector of Prisons to ensure continued oversight during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  In general terms, in instances where, following an inspection, issues are raised by the Inspector, these are considered by the Prison Service and the corresponding responses from the Prison Service are set out in the Inspector's reports or associated documentation upon publication.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I am keen to ensure the Inspector of Prisons is adequately resourced and to this end, there was an increase in the 2021 budget for the Inspector of Prisons of just over &euro;0.75m, bringing the total 2021 allocation to &euro;1.954m and this has been further increased in the 2022 Budget where the Inspector&rsquo;s resources increased by a further &euro;0.4m bringing the total allocation to &euro;2.35m.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that upon her retirement in February the then Inspector of Prisons wrote to me to formally tender her resignation and to outline challenges she faced in carrying out her duties during her tenure.  I intend to engage further with the new Inspector upon appointment on these matters, and with the Prison Service itself, in the context of ongoing work to develop the independent prisons oversight and inspection function.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection from the State can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, I should firstly explain that anyone who wishes to make an application for international protection must proactively do so on their own behalf and on behalf of any of their minor family members. If they apply initially at their port of entry to the State they will still need to make a formal application at the Dublin offices of the International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department. There is no need to make an appointment. Everyone completes their preliminary interview under Section 13 of the International Protection Act 2015 on the day they first attend the IPO offices. Therefore, there are no applicants waiting for a preliminary interview.</p><p>Applicants will generally receive the Temporary Residence Certificate on the same day they complete their application if there is no language barrier and if the number of applications the IPO received on that given day is not excessively high. </p><p>If an interpreter is required to assist them or for other reasons beyond the control of the IPO, the applicant may need to be called back to complete their application. The call back appointment is usually arranged quickly, unless there is a difficulty with sourcing an interpreter for the required language. </p><p>In recent months, the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly with approximately 1,041 new applications received in the month of March alone. This has unfortunately impacted the IPO&rsquo;s ability to complete an application and issue TRC cards on the same day to applicants. There are currently approximately 1,200 applicants who need to return to complete their applications. </p><p>The IPO is identifying what practical efficiencies can be made to the process and is putting in place measures to ensure that the normal service is resumed as quickly as possible for the benefit of applicants.</p></reply>

The Deputy may wish to raise this matter directly with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Science and Innovation. </p><p>There is a coordinated whole-of-Government response to support people arriving in Ireland who have fled the violence in Ukraine. Government Departments and services are working together to implement Ireland's commitments under the EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), which has been activated for the first time to grant temporary protection to displaced persons from Ukraine.</p><p>  The Directive has legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p><p>  Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary.

Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting: fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p><p>Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: </p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee, </p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and </p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.</p><p>To date, 35 schemes have been approved for funding to a total of &euro;948,649.16.

The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. It is my intention to publish the Bill in May 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year. </p><p>This Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. It is expected the Bill will be enacted in 2022.</p></reply>

This was published on foot of the Government decision approving the geographies for the six regional health areas (RHAs). It details the geographies of the six regional health areas, including the hospitals, Community Healthcare Organisations and Local Health Offices contained within each.</p>  <p>  The RHA boundaries were decided following detailed population and health infrastructure analyses of patient service usage patterns across the country. This analysis examined patient flows to establish the extent to which hospitals in a given region are serving patients who live in that region. The regions are designed to be as self-contained as possible across the country. Available infrastructure and population demographics were considered extensively when they were being developed. There is no plan at this time to re-examine the boundaries as we have no indication that infrastructure or demographics have changed significantly in a way since then that would require a re-assessment. </p>  <p>  The scale of change required to regionalise our health service is significant. It will require careful and comprehensive design, planning, and implementation to achieve the objectives and benefits of Regional Health Areas while maintaining and improving the delivery of health services through the transition process. A detailed implementation plan will be finalised in 2022. The transition to RHAs will take place throughout 2023. It is expected that RHAs will be fully operational by Q1 2024.</p></reply>

I recognise that the DTSS, which dates from the 1990s, needs to be reviewed and aligned with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. Work on a substantive review of the DTSS Contract will commence by the end of Q2, 2022. </p>  <p>  I have also acknowledged immediate issues of concern with the Scheme, which I am addressing as a matter of priority. Officials from my Department and from the HSE have held three rounds of discussions with the Irish Dental Association, the most recent on 2nd March when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme.</p>  <p>  I have now given approval for significant fee increases to be paid to contracted dentists across a number of items, including the Dental Examination and Fillings. I have also approved the reintroduction of Scale and Polish for medical card patients on the DTSS. These new measures are designed to address access problems for patients, and address dentist&rsquo;s concerns about the viability of the DTSS, while aligning the DTSS more closely with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by private dentists for PRSI patients.</p>  <p>  These measures should amount to an additional investment this year of about &euro;26 million over what was spent on the Scheme in 2021. My Department and the HSE will work together to quickly implement the changes to the Scheme for the benefit of patients.</p></reply>

A mid-year progress report was published in September 2021 and an end-of-year Progress Report is expected to be published in the near future. Any legislation required as part of these work programmes are considered and progressed in due course. For example, legislation was enacted to facilitate the establishment of a new HSE board as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to Sl&aacute;intecare reform and to ensuring every patient receives the right care, in the right place and at the right time. &euro;1.235 billion was allocated to &lsquo;pure&rsquo; Sl&aacute;intecare initiatives in Budget 2021 enabling and supporting major milestones in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021-2023 to be reached and funding is continuing at historically levels in Budget 2022.</p></reply>

Some &euro;263m, of the &euro;350m fund made available via the 2022 WLAP, has been allocated to the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) this year to source additional outpatient (OPD), endoscopy (GI Scopes), diagnostics and inpatient daycase (IPDC) activity to achieve this.</p>  <p>  A substantial piece of work with Hospital Groups and CHI to identify the specialties and indeed procedures to target is nearing completion. In the meantime, the HSE and NTPF are collaborating to procure as much additional activity as possible using existing arrangements.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to prioritise the delivery of care based on robust clinical guidance. Ongoing monitoring will take place to identify evidence of unmet historical, clinically urgent demand. To the extent that these demands are displacing non-urgent waiting list activity, further efforts will be made to secure additional capacity.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will also progress work towards the achievement of intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the 2022 National Service Plan (98% of all patients on active waiting list will wait less than 18 months for their first Outpatients appointment and less than 12 months for their procedure).</p>  <p>  The 2022 Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready, will receive an offer of treatment via the NTPF.</p></reply>

Projections for 2022 show that over 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year. Many people stayed away from the health service during the pandemic and, as these people come forward for treatment it will place huge additional demand on health services. Under the Waiting List Action Plan, the Department HSE and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity to treat 1.7 million people as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In addition to reducing waiting list volumes and implementing reforms, the 2022 Plan will also progress work towards achieving maximum waiting time targets. The 2017 all-party Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report recognises the need to reduce waiting times for scheduled care services, especially for those with urgent and complex care needs. The Sl&aacute;intecare Report sets out the following recommended maximum waiting time targets for acute scheduled care to be achieved in the long-term that have been adopted as Government targets: no patient should wait longer than 10 weeks for outpatients/assessments; 12 weeks for inpatients / day cases; and 10 days for diagnostics.</p>  <p>  However, given the historically long waiting times for scheduled care and the impact of the pandemic, the numbers of people now waiting for treatment and diagnostics far exceed these stated targets. The 2022 Plan will progress practical work towards the achievement of these maximum waiting targets through a phased approach and the delivery of intermediate targets this year, while also seeking to improve and increase capacity and productivity to deliver an immediate and medium-term reduction in waiting list numbers. The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will progress intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the 2022 National Service Plan of: by end-December 2022,  98% of all patients on our waiting list will wait less than 18 months for their first outpatients appointment (OPD) and 12 months for their procedure (IPDC and GI scopes). The Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready will receive an offer of treatment via the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).</p>  <p>  In total, the 2022 Plan details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists. One of these actions is to develop and agree a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan to support the achievement of the Government maximum wait time targets. As part of this action consideration will be given to decisions relating to codifying such targets in legislation to complement the practical work already underway via other actions in the Plan to achieve these targets.</p></reply>

Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme team, those working in the STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community.</p>  <p>  The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. Commissioning an external review of the Strategy has been approved and will progress through standard procurement processes, which will commence shortly. It is envisaged that the procurement process will conclude by July, with the Review to take 3-4 months once commenced. When complete, the Report will be published on the Healthy Ireland website. Results will, in turn, inform future policy direction.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 22 July 2021, and commenced on 20th October, introduces further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care, which removes a disincentive for scheme participants against selling properties that might otherwise remain vacant. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7).</p>  <p>  My Department is actively collaborating with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other Departments in the development of a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people", as committed to in Housing for All action 19.8. Complex policy questions are currently being resolved in order to meet these criteria and mitigate the high risks and costs associated with unintended consequences, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this is complete. I expect to be in a position to bring legislation forward in the coming months.</p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p></reply>

This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted but there will be additional costs associated with delays and to date, &euro;963.75m of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>  There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p>  <p>  Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73bn. This includes investment in ICT, a new Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning.</p>  <p>  Brexit, the pandemic and recent geopolitical developments have severely impacted supply chains and NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise. </p></reply>

It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple.

While all issues impacting women's health in Ireland are not enumerated in detail in the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, I can confirm that the HSE and my Department are working with pace to improve the supports available to women with this condition. </p>  <p>  In relation to the cost and availability of medications needed in some cases of the treatment of Hyperemesis Gravidarum, important work in this area has commenced in the HSE and officials are engaged with the HSE to progress this work in line with the Ministers request for urgent consideration of this matter. This is a key first step in considering options which can better support women suffering with hyperemesis in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Medicines Management Programme (MMP) has submitted a clinical review and the HSE are now considering if there are potential reimbursement options based on the MMPs recommendations. I am hopeful that the HSE can achieve a positive outcome and my Department and the HSE are continuing to work closely together on this issue.</p>  <p>  Improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes is a key priority for me and this Government. We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023 is the first step to these important improvements. It is important to note that the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan is the first of its kind in Ireland. This plan starts and ends by listening to the women of Ireland. The life cycle of this first plan is of an 18-month duration, is ongoing and will respond to issues as they arise and developing consistently over its life course. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan sets forward a wide range of positive initiatives to support women&rsquo;s health, including maternal health, and provides a framework for further prioritisation as issues and needs arise. It does not enumerate every issue that impact a woman&rsquo;s health but instead spotlights certain issues raised by women in the course of 2019 and 2020 and sets out a framework for regular review to ensure a responsiveness to women on the issues they want to see addressed is embedded in how the plan is implemented. </p>  <p>  It is also supported by significant funding in Budget 2022, for example:</p>  <p>  - An investment of almost &euro;9 million additional funding to ensure continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy into 2022 and beyond, building on the significant investment in 2021,</p>  <p>  - Funding which will allow us to continue improvements in our gynaecology services by establishing a further 6 ambulatory gynaecology "see and treat" clinics, bringing the total to 20 clinics nationally.</p></reply>

We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter.</p>  <p>  This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p>  <p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. Noting that the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.</p></reply>

As a prerequisite to this, the existing paper-based Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) will be replaced with an electronic Self-Assessment Health History (SAHH) questionnaire.</p>  <p>  The IBTS announced that the first phase of these policy changes to began on March 28th of this year. This initial phase reduced the existing 12-month deferral period for MSM to 4 months. This next phase involving the replacement of the HLQ with the SAHH is expected to take place in Q3 of this year, with the individual assessment system to follow later in the year once the SAHH is established.</p>  <p>  The IBTS has advised that the 4 month deferral period is an interim measure to be kept in place until the Individualised Donor Risk Assessment can be carried out on all donors.The IBTS has determined that oral sex between MSM is one of a number of sexual behaviours which will be taken into consideration in this assessment,  and that this approach was previously taken by the UK Blood Services with the introduction of the FAIR system of individual assessment.</p></reply>

My colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for Skills and Further Education also attended this meeting.</p>  <p>  Day services for adults with a disability are developed in line with the New Directions policy. The ambitious change envisaged by New Directions is strongly linked to the implementation of the policy of mainstreaming that was a core part of the National Disability Strategy and is now a core part of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.</p>  <p>  The purpose of mainstreaming is to move from segregation to inclusion, by ensuring that persons with disabilities can take their place in mainstream society, that mainstream public services include people with disabilities and that mainstream public policies take into consideration their impact on people with disabilities. In terms of service provision, mainstreaming means that services for people with disabilities should be the responsibility of whichever Government department has responsibility for such services in general.</p>  <p>  The New Directions approach to adult day services embodies the policy of mainstreaming, and supports service users to access mainstream public services such as further education and training, rather than this type of content being part of the day service itself.</p>  <p>  Improved access to mainstream services is essential to let adults with disabilities participate fully as members of communities, and access to further education is key to enabling people to continue to learn throughout their lives.</p>  <p>  The twelve supports outlined by New Directions include support to access a number of services that are the remit of several government departments and agencies, including the Department for Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), Solas, and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).</p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the HSE on this matter. I have also arranged for my officials to contact Minister Collins&rsquo; office at DFHERIS to send on all information Kildare Down Syndrome Ireland had provided to me at the meeting, for appropriate attention within his Department as DFHERIS&rsquo; &lsquo;Adult Literacy for Life&rsquo; 10 year adult literacy strategy, as it may also be possible to progress programmes such as Latch On as part of this Strategy&rsquo;s work.</p></reply>

This approach helps to reduce geographical variation and ensure that children and young people have the same access to high quality community services regardless of where they live in the country.</p>  <p>  The HSE process involved appropriate engagement with senior officials from the Department of Health Disability Services Unit and subsequently the Minister was advised in January 2020 that the HSE was to introduce a revised standard operating procedure for the Assessment of Need Process and that the  purpose of this procedure was to ensure children with disabilities and their families, access appropriate assessment and intervention as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Its primary purpose is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among doctors.

Doctors register in one of five Divisions of the register, depending on the training they have completed, or are currently undertaking, and this should be commensurate with their status within the workforce. The Medical Council&rsquo;s register is a valid and complete list of doctors who are permitted under Irish law to practice medicine in the State and therefore is a comprehensive source of medical workforce intelligence. </p><p>The table below sets out the number of doctors registered for the first time by the Medical Council each year from 2014 to 2021 according to the location in which they obtained their Basic Medical Qualification (BMQ).  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>Total </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish BMQ</td>       <td>1,087</td>       <td>799</td>       <td>895</td>       <td>908</td>       <td>771</td>       <td>827</td>       <td>1,021</td>       <td>888</td>       <td>7,196</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>International BMQ</td>       <td>871</td>       <td>1,777</td>       <td>1,819</td>       <td>1,685</td>       <td>1,419</td>       <td>1,454</td>       <td>1,017</td>       <td>1,717</td>       <td>11,759</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total No. First Registered</td>       <td>1,958</td>       <td>2,576</td>       <td>2,714</td>       <td>2,593</td>       <td>2,190</td>       <td>2,281</td>       <td>2,038</td>       <td>2,605</td>       <td>18,955</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The reorganisation of care was reflected in the national cardiovascular strategy in 2010 which proposed the centralisation of cardiovascular services in order to maximise access, expertise and population coverage which formed part of the consideration of the current National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.</p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services with specific terms of reference is cognisant of recommendations in the Changing Cardiovascular Health 2010 &ndash; 2019.</p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 with Professor Phillip Nolan as Chair of the Steering Group. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme. The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services is a key enabler for future policy and its recommendations will inform the future provision of services. </p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on the progress of the review, as the Chair has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response, both as a member of the NPHET and Chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group. Work is now underway to progress the Review to completion over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group most recently met on 24/01/2022 and the next meeting is to be scheduled in April 2022.  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report.  The implementation process for the National Cardiac Services Review is also being developed as part of the process to finalise the Report.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. Gynaecology waiting lists are a priority area of focus of this plan. </p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>Waiting list reductions and maximum waiting time targets apply to all acute hospital scheduled care active waiting lists. The HSE is engaged with hospital groups in a process to focus on specialties and procedures towards which the waiting list fund needs to be specifically directed to ensure the targets are achieved by year end.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, outlines the number of patients waiting for a hysterectomy at the end of February 2022.</p><p>IPDC Hysterectomy Waiting List as at 24/02/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Count</th>       <th></th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-24 Mths</td>       <td>24+ Mths</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IPDC Hysterectomy Waits</td>       <td>464</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>522</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>464</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>522</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.The Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy Implementation Framework (IF) was launched in February 2019.</p><p>The overarching aim of the Strategy is the development of neuro-rehabilitation services to improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high quality, person-centred neuro-rehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway, and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary. These services are to be configured into population based managed clinical rehabilitation networks (MCRNs).</p><p>Funding was approved to support the introduction of a managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstrator project. The focus of the demonstrator project is the development of post-acute and community neuro-rehabilitation services across CHO 6 &amp;amp; 7. In terms of service provision, this is where the gap is most evident in terms of demonstrating a Network model.</p><p>Disability Services Community Healthcare area 6 are currently working on the recruitment process, capital funding for the service has already been received and the location for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team (CNRT) has been identified. Disability Services Community Healthcare area 7 are working with Primary Care to identify the location &amp;amp; governance for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team in this area.</p><p>There has been tangible progress with the focus and trajectory of the MCRN in the development of the post-acute and community neurorehabilitation teams and services. The implementation of a 10 bedded neurorehabilitation unit in Peamount has improved timely and early access to post-acute specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disability including those neurological complications associated with severe COVID infection from the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. These new beds introduce some 3,500 additional specialist rehab bed days per annum into the system and are expected to reduce the NRH waiting list by over 30%, and take direct referrals from AMNCH, SJH, SVUH, Beaumont &amp;amp; the Mater for patients with neurological conditions. </p></reply>

This will include a review of prescribing for all diagnoses and medications and will be based on an audit of case files. This has been agreed following discussions with the HSE. I have asked the HSE to complete the audit as soon as possible and I have asked them for an implementation plan. </p>  <p>  Alongside this, the HSE will expedite the development of clinical standards for prescribing practice in children with and without psychosis. Once these standards have been developed and implemented, an annual audit will be carried out to measure compliance against these standards (in line with recommendations in the Maskey Report).</p>  <p>  One of Dr Maskey&rsquo;s recommendations is that children and their families should be invited to be part of the governance structure of the CAMHS service. HSE are working to implement that recommendation and would also welcome the opportunity to meet with a representative group in the near future. HSE have reached out to the new representative group with a view to meeting them at an early date. Separately, the HSE is commissioning qualitative research to identify the experiences of children, young people and their families using CAMHS nationwide.</p>  <p>  This is on top of the audit of compliance with CAMHS operating guidelines and the separate and independent review being conducted by the Mental Health Commission.</p>  <p>  I met with representatives of the Kerry CAMHS Family Support Group at the beginning of March. The HSE will continue to meet as appropriate families or representatives at local level to keep them informed of developments. I will continue to liaise closely with the HSE to ensure that the above initiatives are progressed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the Act must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act, i.e., before January 2022.</p>  <p>  As I stated previously, the review will comprise a three-part approach to appraise the operation of the Act, with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation. Independent research commissioned to inform the service user and service provider strands will form key elements of the review.</p>  <p>  A final report will be submitted to me for consideration in late 2022, before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

It is also available in single ingredient, non-prescription products, as a cough suppressant. These authorised products are available without a prescription through retail pharmacy businesses (pharmacies) only.</p>  <p>  The Pharmacy Act 2007 and the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008 require that all medicines supplied through a pharmacy must be supplied by or under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and that all non-prescription medicines supplied must be the subject of appropriate counselling.</p>  <p>  The Pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) issued guidance to pharmacists on the safe supply of non-prescription products containing codeine in 2010. This Guidance was updated in 2015, in 2017 and again in October 2019. The Guidance covers the requirements set out above and in addition contains further restrictions which apply to the supply of codeine containing medicinal products. </p>  <p>  These restrictions include a requirement that codeine containing medicinal products are not available to the public for self-selection and should only be supplied when a pharmacist deems such a supply to be necessary and only when a non-opioid analgesic, e.g. paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen, has not proven sufficient to relive the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. The Guidance also states that medicines containing codeine should be used for the shortest time possible and for no longer than three days without medical supervision. Pharmacists must also ensure that patients are advised of the importance of adhering to the recommended dosage and duration of use as well as the risks associated with overdose and or/prolonged use. Patients should also be counselled in respect of potential adverse reactions or side effects.</p>  <p>The full Guidance document, along with information on current legislative requirements, is available on the PSI website: thepsi.ie/Libraries/Folder_Pharmacy_Practice_Guidance/01_3_Safe_supply_of_Codeine_to_patients.sflb.ashx.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working with relevant stakeholders in fully considering any policy changes that may be required regarding the regulation of codeine containing medicinal products.</p>  <p>  Any potential change to the prescription requirements for codeine containing medicinal products must be supported by sufficient evidence. Based on available evidence, we will consider taking any necessary further steps to support the safe and effective use of these medicines.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. </p><p>Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p><p>The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.</p><p>Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, Divigel was received by the wholesaler on 25th March and has been released for sale this week. An alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently gone short and is expected to resume supply in April. In the interim, the company is working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  <b></b></p><p>The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.</p><p>The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p><p>The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p><p>With regards to affordability, at present GPs provide consultations without charge to women who have a medical card or GP visit card. Approved prescribed drugs and medicines (including approved HRT), are available free to medical card holders, subject to the statutory prescription charge. </p></reply>

There are also standalone consultation events such as the Department of Justice consultation conducted prior to the adoption of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.</p><p>In Ireland&rsquo;s case, other than Northern Irish vessels under Voisinage Agreement, no EU Member State or Third Country has access to our 0-6 nautical miles zone.  Foreign fishing vessels are excluded from the 6-12 nautical miles zone on our North-west Coast, from Lough Foyle to Eris Head, and along the South-west Coast between Mizen Head and Sybil Point.  France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have access for specific species in various areas of the 6-12 nautical mile zone along Ireland&rsquo;s West, East and South coasts.  Ireland does not have access to any other Member States&rsquo; 6-12 nautical mile zones.</p><p>Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the CFP Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013).  I am seeking an extension of the 6 and 12 nautical miles zones out to 12 and 20 miles, respectively.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit.</p><p>Quotas for the various stocks are allocated for management areas - that is, an ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) area or a part thereof - and not Member States' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ).  Generally, most stock areas straddle more than one EEZ area. These stock areas can include Member States' EEZs, third countries' EEZs and international waters. </p><p>For example, the Total allowable Catch (TAC) area for the Hake Stock is ICES Areas 6 and 7 which stretches from the north of Scotland south to the north coast of Brittany, and into the English Channel.This area includes parts of the UK EEZ, the Irish EEZ, part of the French EEZ and some international waters.  Ireland's quota may be fished in any part of this area.Ireland's main Mackerel quota covers ICES Areas 6 and 7 stretching from north of Scotland to the north coast of Brittany and the full quota may be fished in UK waters of the northern North Sea.The access to the northern North Sea is economically important for our fleet.</p><p>The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, based on a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU.  The share out of TACs set in more recent years has also been mainly based on track record, the most recent of these of importance to Ireland has been boarfish. </p><p>The details of the stocks for which Ireland and other Member States have quota in the relevant management areas are set out in the TAC and Quota Regulation each year.</p></reply>

This package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops for this coming planting season through the Tillage Incentive Scheme. It is proposed to encourage farmers to grow more eligible tillage crops in 2022 versus 2021. </p>  <p>  Eligible crops include the cereal crops barley, wheat, oats, rye, oilseed rape, maize, and beet. A payment of &euro;400 per hectare is proposed. The proposed budget for the Scheme is &euro;10 million and is aimed at encouraging an additional 25,000 hectares of the eligible tillage crops.  </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the Deputy's question, I can confirm that under sown cereals are eligible under the scheme. However, farmers must establish the cereal, for example if barley is sown, as the primary crop and must be maintained to a good commercial standard. It is expected that the eligible crops are managed correctly in terms of crop establishment, nutrition, weed and disease control etc. In summary, once the eligible cereal crop is established and maintained properly grass seed may be under sown.</p></reply>

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20 March 2022.  The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. </p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security. In addition, the Commission in view of the particularly difficult situation in the pig meat sector has opened a new private storage aid scheme to assist in stabilising the sector.</p>  <p>  We are currently examining the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to the exceptional aid allocation to Ireland of &euro;15.8 million in EU funding,  and considering how it might be used to support the Irish agricultural sector. </p></reply>

The Appropriate Assessment procedures and subsequent mitigation measures in place today go beyond those envisaged in the NIS published at the end of 2014.</p><p>Policy documents such as &lsquo;<i>Environmental Requirements for Afforestation&rsquo;</i>and &lsquo;<i>Standards for Felling and Reforestation&rsquo;</i>published in 2016 and 2019 respectively underpin my Department&rsquo;s approach to protecting European sites, giving a baseline of good practice helping to ensure that the conservation status of qualifying interests will not be adversely affected by the forestry operations being proposed. Publication of &lsquo;<i>Forests &amp;amp; Water Achieving Objectives under Ireland&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021</i>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<i>AA Procedure Guidance Note &amp;amp; iFORIS SOP for DAFM Forestry Inspectors (2019)</i>&rsquo; are other important documents that help the Department protect European sites.</p><p>Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and associated technologies play a major role today in how my Department ensures that European Sites are protected when forestry operations are being carried out. This allows for all proposed projects to be assessed in terms of their proximity to European sites and their associated species and habitats. For example, Hydrological connectivity is assessed at individual site level and this assessment is aided by using the latest EPA GIS data which includes sub catchment data and rivers.  </p><p>DAFM's mitigations in relation to the Hen harrier are based on a protocol agreed with the NPWS. Datasets identifying High Likelihood Nesting Areas are regularly updated by the NPWS and the Department is able to immediately update its QGIS systems to ensure that the appropriate measures are applied to the latest data on breeding Hen harriers in SPAs designated for Hen Harriers. Ecologists assessing files have access to this dedicated Ecological QGIS system. Other datasets available in the QGIS system include the Semi-natural grassland survey layer, non-designated hen harrier areas and curlew breeding buffer layer. OSI&rsquo;s  prime 2 water body dataset was also added to the Departments GIS system within the last 12 months. </p><p>The Department's data requirements for both statutory and non-statutory designated sites are subject to continuous review and improvement. This includes NPWS data which is updated regularly. Almost 90 amendments have been made to datasets used by my Department since the Forestry Programmes NIS was published in 2014.</p><p>The Department has also strengthened its staff resource in the field of ecology, with a strong emphasis on Appropriate Assessment since the NIS was published. Currently, there are 36 ecologists employed by the Department where only one ecologist was employed by the Department when the Forestry programme NIS was written. There are over 40 Forestry Inspectors.  In 2018, the Forestry Inspectors and all Registered Foresters received Annex 1 habitat training, and further Habitat training is planned.  </p><p>The SEA environmental report concluded that with the adoption of the listed mitigation measures it was anticipated that none of the effects identified as adverse in the detailed matrix assessment will be of greater than negligible significance and ensure that, even without adoption of enhancement measures, the overall effect of the Forestry Programme is strongly positive. In keeping with the SEA obligations, my Department undertakes monitoring in relation to the implementation of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 in relation to all sites and not just those designated as European sites. This monitoring is carried out <i>inter alia</i>in order to be able to identify at an early stage any unforeseen adverse effects and to be able to undertake appropriate remedial action.</p><p>The monitoring programme is ongoing and includes the use of information collated in relation to projects approved under the programme. In this regard significant data is available on the Departments website including the Forestry Division Monthly reports detailing information about  afforestation, roads, woodland Improvement and Reconstitution and Underplanting of woodlands schemes.  Species composition is provided in the Forest Statistics Ireland annual publication also available on the Departments website. The Department&rsquo;s forest licence viewer provides access to view the location of public and private forests as well as proposed forests and proposed roads.  </p><p>The Department also monitor information provided by other sources, i.e. from other existing monitoring and reporting arrangements arising from EU legislation other than the SEA Directive and from national legislation or policies, and which can be indirectly used for purpose of monitoring for significant environmental effects arising from the implementation of the programme. Also, the reports required under Article 17 of the habitats Directive on &lsquo;The status of EU protected habitats and species in Ireland&rsquo; and the implementation of the measures taken under the Habitats Directive are reported upon to the European Commission every six years. The latest report was published in 2019 and recognises &ldquo;the improved consideration of the type and location of planting&rdquo;.</p><p>The EPA is the national competent authority for the Water Framework Directive and associated implementing Regulations. The national Water Framework Directive monitoring programme for Ireland for the period 2019-2021, undertaken by the EPA is comprised of 3,169 surface and groundwater bodies. My Department is listed as a relevant public authority under the First Schedule of the S.I. and the Forestry Inspectorate, accordingly, actively engage with the EPA. The EPA waterbodies and High-Status Objective Waterbodies layers are provided to the Forestry Inspectorate by the EPA, and form part of the consideration of licence assessments. The most up to date layer on WFD status and pressures was provided to the DAFM Forestry Division as soon as it became available on 28<sup>th</sup>February this year, and is being added to the IFORIS system where it will be a central part of the licence assessment process. In addition, the Forestry Inspectorate participate on several working groups and committees established under the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, including the National Technical Implementation Group, the Blue Dot Programme and all five Regional Operational Committees. The Department&rsquo;s Forestry Division is a participant of the largescale Waters of Life Integrated Project.</p></reply>

Each licence has a value particularly to the rural economy where the timber is harvested, transported and processed. </p>  <p>  Since the commencement of 2022 up until the 25 March, 2022 my Department has issued a total number of 867 felling licences of those 59% were Coillte licences. We are 85% on target for private felling licences  at this stage of the year, and we are fully committed to delivering the full 1,830 private licences by year end  as outlined in the Licensing Plan. </p>  <p>  The Department issued 2,877 felling licences last year which represented more than 8 million cubic metres of timber. This was the highest ever output licensed in volume terms in a single year.</p>  <p>  Last year, Coillte received 53% of felling licences and the other 47% going to the private sector.  Coillte currently supply around 75% of sawlog to sawmills</p>  <p>  Our plans for licence issue in 2022 are contained in the Forestry Licensing Plan with a target of 5,250 licences issues, which is a year-on-year increase of 30%.  This includes an increase of 36% in private felling licences to 1,830, while Coillte felling licences  at 1,530 will maintain the levels they achieved in 2021. The Licensing Plan 2022 may be found here gov.ie - Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 (www.gov.ie). </p></reply>

This support scheme provides a range of supports to assist homes and businesses, including farmers to develop renewable generation for self-consumption with the micro-generation enabling framework introduces payments to micro-generators for exported electricity for the first time. This scheme will support the deployment of an expected 380 MW of new micro (50 kW) to support the deployment of rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 recognises the important contribution of microgeneration to the decarbonisation of the energy system and commits to delivering a Microgeneration Policy Framework (see Action 105), led by my ministerial colleague Eamon Ryan. Specifically, this action will address the development and trialling of a streamlined grid connection pathway for installation sizes up to 50Kw.  I do believe that farmers can positively contribute to this energy transition and I continue to engage with ministerial colleagues in the Department of Environment, Climate Action and Communication in this regard and on other energy-related matters.</p>  <p>  To encourage on-farm renewable technology uptake and usage, grant aid is provided through TAMS in my Department to assist farmers in maximising their contribution to the production of renewable energy through the installation of Solar PV technology along with battery storage on Irish farms. The solar PV systems grant-aided under TAMS include Solar PV Panels and Solar PV Rechargeable Batteries and Solar Panels for water heating under the Pig and Poultry Capital Investment Scheme.

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. </p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. </p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20 March 2022. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.</p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. </p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security. In addition, the Commission in view of the particularly difficult situation in the pig meat sector has opened a new private storage aid scheme to assist in stabilising the sector.</p>  <p>  We are currently examining the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to the exceptional aid allocation to Ireland of &euro;15.8 million in EU funding, and considering how it might be used to support the Irish agricultural sector. </p></reply>

As you may be aware Project Woodland was launched in February 2021 and aims to improve the forestry licensing system as well as developing a shared vision for woodland creation in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The regulatory review is assessing the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. The review is also considering the issue of a single consent system and statutory timelines. The draft review was recently presented to the Project Board and the Project Woodland Working Groups and will be presented to the Forestry Policy Group this week.  </p>  <p>  The regulatory review is expected to be finalised following this stakeholder engagement. Once finalised, the review will be published and the Department will consider all recommendations the consultants have made.</p></reply>

Securing this consultancy service is a necessary precursor in line with the public works contract.  The tender competition closed on the 10th March and my Department has completed our assessment of tenders.  All tenderers were notified on 24th March and the process is currently in the standstill period required under public procurement policy.   </p>  <p>  The successful Consultant will complete the detailed design, manage the tender process for construction works, supervise the construction works, and in due course handover completed construction works back to my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department officials will promptly meet the Consultant after awarding the contract.

Furthermore, over the past three years, my Department has introduced extra controls on animal welfare during export by road, such as additional checks to prevent transport of animals during hot weather, an increase in the minimum space allowance for calves in trucks that is more than that specified in EU rules, and a requirement for drivers and attendants to undergo training every three years, rather than ten years as formerly.  </p>  <p>  Department officials and inspectors monitor compliance through a system of official controls, including advance checks of weather along the proposed journey, and veterinary inspection of lorries, livestock vessels and of all animals before they travel. Journeys must be notified to the Regional Veterinary Office two days in advance, and veterinary certification will only be provided where the journey complies with all animal transport and animal welfare regulations.

However, at farm level, the crisis is already impacting on the price of animal feed, fertiliser and fuel. Within the Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team, chaired by the Secretary General, to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis. I have established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee, led by Teagasc, and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. I have just launched a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, which together are worth over &euro;12 million in support to Irish farmers. The package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser. An emergency aid scheme for pig farmers of &euro;7 million opened for applications on 7 March. This will provide commercial pig farmers a payment of up to &euro;20,000 each. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. The Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is the key mechanism for ensuring food security throughout Europe. I have been engaged with EU Agriculture Ministers since the beginning of the crisis and on 23rd March the European Commission announced, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. A &euro;500 million package to support EU farmers most affected includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.  I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision. </p><p>I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis using all of the tools at our disposal. Last year, according to the Economist's Global Food Security Index, Ireland was ranked first in terms of food security across a range of indicators. While my Department are monitoring the situation closely, all indications suggest that Ireland will continue to be a food secure country.</p></reply>

The scheme encourages farmers to register with a relevant breed society and maintain registered purebred stock during the scheme's lifetime. Payment is made in arrears based on the monthly average livestock units of owned registered animals over the previous recording year.  It is envisaged that a grant of similar nature will be included in the new CAP programme.</p>  <p>  Similarly, a grant continues to be provided to encourage the maintenance of a number of herds of Kerry Cattle and the creation and maintenance of a sufficient reserve of purebred breeding stock in that regard. The Department also provides a small grant to assist organisations conserve and protect Irish rare breed farm animals.    </p>  <p>  In addition, the Genetic Resources Grant Aid Scheme (GRGAS) has been in place since 1996. The Scheme has an annual call for projects aimed at supporting the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources for food and agriculture. Funding has been provided for a diverse range of projects such as raising awareness and educating the general public in the importance of genetic resources, for participation in internationally recognised research and collaboration with European and other international partners in the field of animal genetic resources.  The effects of this grant aid are far reaching and play a vitally important role in fulfilling Ireland's international obligations in relation to the conservation of animal genetic resources.</p>  <p>  I believe these schemes show my commitment towards maintaining rare breeds as an important resource that need to be conserved into the future.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Galway County Council are responsible for the development of stage 3 of this project. </p>  <p>  As part of the preparatory works, the National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI) were instructed by Galway County Council to develop a model simulation for the harbour. Galway County Council are collating the technical specifications of the key vessels that use the harbour and this data will be fed into the simulation. It is hoped that the simulation will be completed, and tested with feedback given, by the end of August. </p>  <p>  To feed into this process, additional bathymetric studies are also to be carried out in the harbour to gather further data and it is hoped that these will be completed by the end of April. It is important to note that this timeline is dependent on weather and marine conditions. </p>  <p>  Once this work has been completed, Galway County Council will incorporate the findings into a draft business case. Following on from this, my Department will be in a position to evaluate the next steps in the process. </p></reply>

There are currently 223 hubs live on the platform with this number rising on an ongoing basis.  The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. The platform offers booking and hub management applications to network members. </p><p>In late February this year, I launched the Connected Hubs marketing campaign and mobile phone app. This will help to underpin usage by remote workers across the hub network and ensure that they remain as a viable option for workers across Ireland.</p><p>To date, these initiatives have delivered positive results. For example, the visits to ConnectedHubs.ie tripled from January to February, with visitors interacting with the website from as far away as the USA. The app has also seen some encouraging traffic.  For example, there has been a conversion rate of almost 90% from Android users who searched for the app and decided to download it. </p><p>While the marketing campaign and app are still at an early stage, and we will get more comprehensive data in the coming months, those early results are very positive and my officials continue to monitor developments.</p><p>To date our focus has been to develop the hub network. With the Connected Hubs marketing campaign now ongoing, the focus has shifted to raising awareness of the network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs/business owners and new hub users to drive use of this invaluable national resource</p><p>The establishment of a National Hubs Network is a key commitment in <i>Our Rural Future</i>and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery. </p></reply>

The initiative aims to support the development of wireless broadband by providing a high-quality internet service, free of charge, in public spaces such as main streets, public parks, libraries, museums and other public areas of high footfall. </p><p>Under the WiFi4EU scheme, local authorities applied through a competitive process to secure vouchers worth &euro;15,000 each to install Wi-Fi hotspots.  Local authorities could apply for up to 4 vouchers each throughout the lifetime of the initiative, and they must install a minimum of 10 access points per voucher. Depending on the location chosen, one or more access point may be required in that location. </p><p>In all, local authorities have secured 114 vouchers out of a maximum of 124 vouchers available, which makes Ireland one of the most successful countries to take part in the scheme. 30 of the 31 local authorities secured vouchers under the scheme. </p><p>My Department is providing co-funding of up to &euro;15,000 for each voucher secured by the local authorities, effectively doubling the value of the investment.  It is estimated that over 1,500 WiFi hotspots could be installed at locations across the country under the WiFi4EU initiative when completed. To date, 967 hotspots are live across 21 Local Authority areas and the county breakdown is attached in tabular form. </p><p>The EU granted extensions to local authorities due to Covid restrictions in place during 2020 and 2021 to allow time for local authorities to fully complete their projects.  The WIFI4EU scheme will be fully completed by December 2022 when it is expected that the remaining local authorities will have utilised the vouchers granted.</p><p><b>WIFI4EU Connections by County</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>County</th>       <th>Live Connections</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1.</td>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2.</td>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3.</td>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6.</td>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7.</td>       <td>DCC</td>       <td>108</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>9.</td>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10.</td>       <td>Galway City</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11.</td>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12.</td>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16.</td>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17.</td>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18.</td>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>20.</td>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>21.</td>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>56</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>22.</td>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23.</td>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>24.</td>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>25.</td>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>27.</td>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>28.</td>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>29.</td>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>967</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The policy will maximise our resources and strengths in the Green Economy to support employment opportunities for communities in other areas such as renewable energy, sustainable tourism, the bioeconomy and the circular economy. </p>  <p>  It contains over 150 policy measures for delivery, including a specific measure to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps across the country up to 2030. Delivery of this measure is being led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and SEAI.</p>  <p>  As part of the implementation monitoring process for Our Rural Future my Department produces progress reports on measures contained in the policy, with the first of these published in February.  This process has entailed my officials directly engaging with Government Departments in relation to the range of measures contained in the policy.

There are currently 223 hubs live on the platform, with this number rising on an ongoing basis. This represents significant progress within the first year of the existence of the network. </p><p>Details for the onboarded hub facilities can be obtained via the Connected hubs platform - www.connectedhubs.ie </p><p>I recently launched the Connected Hubs mobile app, which allow users to find their nearest hub facility and easily book a desk space using their mobile device. The Connected Hubs mobile app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store for iOS devices and the Google Play Store for Android.  </p><p>Last year, I allocated almost &euro;9 million to the 2021 Connected Hubs Fund, which supported over 100 hubs and Broadband Connection Points (BCPs), to add capacity and improve the quality of existing remote working facilities across the state.</p><p>In February this year, I launched the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, a &euro;5 million funding stream to further support remote working facilities, including BCPs, throughout the country and add further capacity to the National Hub Network.  </p><p>The National Hub Network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating the needs of different employers and employees across Ireland. To date my focus has been on establishing the network and on achieving the initial critical mass. Following strong progress on the establishment phase of the project, my focus has now shifted to the next stage of development. </p><p>To this end, my officials have been consulting with hub managers across the country, and with other stakeholders, to better inform the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network and of the connectedhubs.ie platform.  I also recently announced the commencement of a major promotional campaign which will serve to raise awareness of the services available on connectedhubs.ie and drive usage of this invaluable national resource.</p><p>This shift of focus will help to ensure that the network continues to provide the level of service that employers and employees need and expect.</p><p>I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery.</p></reply>

The landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) provides funding for the development and enhancement of amenities such as walking trails. </p>  <p>Last September, I announced the 'approval in principle' of 31 new trails to join the Walks Scheme. This fulfills the commitment in the Programme for Government and Our Rural Future to double the number of trails on the Scheme to 80 trails. These trails are being formally brought onto the scheme by Local Development Companies who deliver the Walks Scheme locally and who are developing work plans for each of the individual landholders involved. </p>  <p>The new trails added to the scheme were selected following a call for expressions of interest to join the scheme. I understand that no expressions of interest were received in respect of trails in the Dublin Mountains.</p>  <p>Trails that are eligible for inclusion in the Walks Scheme are those that are registered with Sport Ireland and covered by the Sport Ireland trail insurance policy. For example, I understand that the Dublin Mountains Way is registered with Sport Ireland and may be eligible to apply to the scheme in the future.  There may be other routes that are not included on the Sport Ireland register and would not be eligible for the scheme. As such, the position in respect of each trail would have to be assessed on a case by case basis before they could be considered for the scheme.</p>  <p>Once the new trails are fully operational under the Scheme, I will examine the potential for the further expansion of the Scheme. An expression of interest process will be opened for new trails, including those in the Dublin mountains, in advance of any further expansion of the scheme.</p></reply>

Their core objective is to achieve a social, societal, or environmental impact. Like any other business, they pursue their objectives by trading in goods and services on an ongoing basis. However, surpluses generated are re-invested into achieving their core social objectives. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the great work that Inner City Enterprise (ICE) does in supporting the development of social enterprises in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city and providing employment opportunities. Their annual Dublin City Social Enterprise Awards, in partnership with Dublin City Council, is an inspirational event which demonstrates the vibrancy of the sector. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question, I would advise ICE to seek guidance from their Local Development Company (LDC) and Local Enterprise office (LEO) as to the range of supports, including capital development funding, available. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide capital supports to social enterprise through the annual &euro;2.3m Dormant Accounts funded Social Enterprise Measure, and I plan to make further announcements on new capital supports in the near future in line with policy commitments. Information about all new schemes will be made available on my Department's website, and will be circulated widely amongst social enterprise stakeholders, networks and support organisations, including Inner City Enterprise.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the measure supported 247 social enterprises through the &euro;1m Social Enterprise Capital Grants Scheme, and the &euro;680k Awareness Raising Initiative for Social Enterprise (ARISE) which supported 50 projects. I also provided &euro;400k funding for a pilot Start-up Scheme for Social Enterprise which supported 25 early stage social enterprises, and &euro;160k funding to the Covid-19 Social Enterprise Regeneration Programme, which is providing training and mentoring in strategic planning and income diversification. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides significant supports to social enterprise through a number of other programmes including the Community Services Programme (CSP), Social Inclusion Community Activation Programme (SICAP) and LEADER.</p>  <p>  Apart from funding, my Department also supports the development of social enterprises in other important ways such as providing training and mentoring, increasing awareness of social enterprise, cross Government and international engagement, supporting higher level research and providing guidance into issues such as legal forms for social enterprise.</p></reply>

This funding ensures that we are in a position to further assist communities seeking funding and other supports for important local activities and projects. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government places a strong emphasis on balanced regional development through a range of measures.  The Department supports this commitment through targeted investment that supports rural regeneration, facilitates new working opportunities and fosters regional enterprise growth.  </p>  <p>  We will continue to invest in, and support, communities across the country - through the various schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, LEADER Programme, Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, Local Improvement Scheme, CL&Aacute;R Programme, Islands Capital Programme, Community Enhancement Programme, Connected Hubs initiative, Libraries Investment Capital funding, PEACE IV Programme and the PEACE PLUS Programme.  </p>  <p>  The supports provided by my Department to assist vulnerable communities are more important than ever.  Details of funding allocations under specific schemes provided by my Department are available online at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-rural-and-community-development/</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;2 million was secured to design and implement a new Empowering Communities Programme (ECP) in 2022 aimed at specifically targeting area-based deprivation through a community development approach. This initiative, in part, stems from a Programme for Government commitment to expand the Dublin North East Inner City model and will be informed by other initiatives such as the Community Development Pilot Programme, the Place-Based Leadership initiative and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme which operates across the country. </p>  <p>  The ECP will focus on augmenting the community development efforts within a number of small geographic areas identified as experiencing particular disadvantage. The ECP is currently at a very early stage of development and the detail, including on the areas selected, has not yet been finalised. Further information will be shared once it is available.</p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for a number of important policies, including the  National Policy on Social Enterprise, and Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities which is a 5 Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector 2019-2024.  In March 2021 I launched Our Rural Future, a new whole-of-Government rural development policy. The policy which was underpinned by broad consultation, is an ambitious blueprint for the social and economic development of rural Ireland over the next five years. It has the potential to have a transformative effect on rural communities and positive impacts on the lives of people living and working in rural areas. The policy is supported by 150 commitments across Government, which will address the challenges facing communities and deliver new opportunities for people living in rural areas.</p>  <p>  All my Department&rsquo;s policies are underpinned by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including rural and urban stakeholder groups, community groups, young people, Government Departments and State Agencies. </p>  <p>  This engagement process provides important insights into issues impacting on rural and urban communities and in identifying areas for response which are relevant to the work of my Department. Ongoing dialogue is maintained with rural and urban stakeholders in order to identify and respond to shortcomings and issues impacting on individuals and communities.  </p>  <p>  I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs.</p></reply>

This Strategy is important in seeking to strengthen the community development, local development and community and voluntary sectors generally. The strategy reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the sector, whilst also recognising the reality of finite resources and the need to ensure that available resources are focused on providing effective services.</p><p>Co-produced by Government and the Community and Voluntary Sector, the Strategy sets out 11 high-level objectives and associated actions which will empower communities, their representative organisations, and the community and voluntary sector, to inform and shape responses to their needs.</p><p>In furtherance of the strategy objectives and the Programme for Government commitment, last year I was pleased to announce the introduction of a &euro;1 million pilot Community Development Programme, promoting an autonomous approach to community work with marginalised communities.  It is expected the programme will continue for three years. </p><p>During 2022, my Department will continue to deliver a wide range of measures to support community development as a task, a process and a profession, to grow sustainably and to address emerging needs.</p><p>This will include, amongst other work, continued implementation of the measures set out in the five year strategy; collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to equip Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) with the required knowledge and skills for the preparation of their Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP); and funding to directly support community development activities &ndash; including the support of pilot community development projects. </p><p>In January of this year, I attended the induction day of a Place-Based Leadership Development Programme in Darndale. Funded by my Department, this important Programme is being delivered in Darndale and Drogheda, following recommendations in the Nolan and Geiran reports. The Programme is an investment in local leaders to help them address the challenges experienced in those areas.</p><p>The Place-Based Leadership Development programme will strengthen the capacity of those already working hard to improve the quality of community life in Darndale and Drogheda. The programme will encourage and facilitate collaboration that will positively impact the culture of the area. It will build the capacity of new community leaders to empower communities to address the issues they face. This approach will make a lasting impact and bring forward the solutions required.</p><p>Place Based Leadership will open up new perspectives and possibilities and provide opportunities for mutual learning that can be built upon and expanded to other communities in Ireland going forward.</p><p>My Department has committed to providing financial support to the All Ireland Endorsement Body (AIEB) for the three year period 2020 &ndash; 2022 inclusive.  AIEB was established in 2010 as an all island body to support and promote quality community work/community development and ensure standards and quality in practice. It seeks to support and promote community development education and training and ensure quality and standards in practice by the:</p><p>- Development and delivery of endorsement frameworks for community work qualifications, procedures, and processes for community work education providers.</p><p>- Development of standards and support for education and training at all levels.</p><p>- Development and maintenance of standards for practitioners, community work organisations, for programmes and policy makers.</p><p>- Development and maintenance of appropriate links and exchanges with national and international quality assurance and educational bodies.</p><p>I am confident that the funding supports and policies provided by my Department are delivering, and will continue to deliver, tangible benefits for both urban and rural communities, supporting economic development, and enabling the local and community development sectors to continue to provide valuable much needed services and supports to all communities throughout the country.</p></reply>

The focus of the PPN is to empower and assist groups to participate in local decision making. This facilitates a two way flow of information between the Local Authority and community groups.  We also remain in close contact with bodies that represent the local development and community and voluntary sectors.</p>  <p>  My Department has a number of programmes that focus on improving the lives of people experiencing disadvantage, for example the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme or SICAP.  </p>  <p>  SICAP is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention.  It aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality. It is delivered in both rural and urban areas by Local Development Companies (LDCs) who work with the most disadvantaged and the hardest to reach in communities.</p>  <p>  To ensure that funding is adequately targeted, the HP Pobal Deprivation Index is used which identifies the relative levels of affluence or disadvantage across geographic areas, using data from the national census. </p></reply>

A feature of the LEADER programme is that it is based on a community-led, bottom-up approach to rural development.</p>  <p>  The programme includes specific funding themes to support rural economic development, enterprise development and job creation, social inclusion, and rural environment.  Community groups and rural-based businesses can apply for funding under these themes.  The website of the National Rural Network contains case studies of how LEADER has benefited local communities and businesses.   Over 5,000 projects have been approved for in excess of &euro;215 million under these themes since the 2014-2020 LEADER programme became operational.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in Our Rural Future, I launched the Transitional LEADER Programme which came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;65 million of this budget is available to Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.  This allocation covers both core project expenditure and the administration and animation costs of the LAGs.  </p>  <p>  The Transitional Programme will ensure that LEADER will continue to support and revitalise our communities and make them sustainable and desirable places in which to live and work through co-ordinated approaches that build on the economic strengths and infrastructure of rural areas.</p>  <p>  An indicative budget of &euro;180 million is allocated for the LEADER programme for the period 2023-2027. With the &euro;70 million already provided for 2021 and 2022 under the Transitional LEADER Programme, a total of &euro;250 million will be made available for the 2021 - 2027 period, thus maintaining the level of funding provided for the 2014-2020 programming period.</p>  <p>  Preparations for the design and delivery of the next LEADER programme from 2023-2027 are underway and my officials are also engaging with stakeholders in this regard.  The ongoing engagement and consultation combined with the funding allocation ensures that the LEADER programme from 2023 will continue to support and further develop our rural communities and businesses.</p></reply>

The Policy contains a wide range of actions across Government which will support this aim.  I recently published the first Progress Report for Our Rural Future, which shows the considerable progress that has been made under the Policy to date.</p><p>In relation to the specific issue of hubs as referenced by the Deputy, Our Rural Future recognises the potential of remote working hubs as key economic assets for our rural towns and villages. Notwithstanding the clear benefits to individuals and families in terms of quality of life indicators, remote working from hubs will also support local economies, reduce carbon emissions and may arrest or reverse the depopulation of certain areas.</p><p>Last May I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform.  The platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to members of the Network, both hub managers and remote workers. There are currently 223 hubs live on the platform, with this number increasing on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Hubs in the National Network may be found in villages, towns and cities across the country and, when the Network is complete, I expect more than 400 hubs to be available via the shared online platform. The location and details of all hubs in the National Hub Network may be found at www.connectedhubs.ie</p><p>In parallel with the National Hubs Network project, my department is also establishing 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) in rural and isolated areas, including a number of off-shore islands. BCPs are publicly accessible facilities that will make onsite internet-enabled services available to their local communities, including remote work and study. The locations of all BCPs, live and planned, may be found at www.myconnectedcommunity.ie</p><p>My Department continues to fund the establishment and development of remote working hubs under a number of funding streams, including funding of &euro;18.5m under the 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  Successful projects included 28 remote working proposals.</p><p>Furthermore, in February I launched the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, a &euro;5 million funding stream to further support remote working facilities (including BCPs) throughout the country and add further capacity to the National Hub Network. My officials are currently evaluating the applications submitted and I expect to announce the successful applicants in the next few weeks. </p><p>In short, my Department has for the last number of years made a determined effort to ensure, in so far as is reasonably possible, that those wishing to work from a remote or co-working space has the opportunity to do so.The investment in and development of this remote working infrastructure will have tangible impact on the delivery of more balanced regional and rural development.</p></reply>
