    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-19a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900064#WRA00600"><p>Since the publication online of the 1901 and 1911 Census returns, a huge volume of records have now been made available online that are invaluable to people in carrying out their own family history research.  On my Departments website;<i>www.irishgenealogy.ie</i>, it is now possible to view the historic Civil Registers of Births, Marriages and Deaths which date back to 1864 and in the case of non-Roman Catholic Church marriages as far back as 1845.  In total there are over 15 million entries available to view and each year a further year of records is added to the website.  This along with the images of Roman Catholic Church register entries for the 19th and 18th Centuries available online on the National Library of Ireland website contain a huge of information for people to carry out their family history research.  I am also pleased to announce that the Church of Ireland Representative Church Body Library is making great strides in its digitisation programme, and its Church registers will also be available in the future on the Departments website www.irishgenealogy.ie. </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a significant body of information from the 1926 census has been collated and published by the Central Statistics Office on its website. There are hundreds of tables giving details of the size, age, gender, occupations, housing, dependency, and the speaking of Irish in the population of the State in 1926. These tables are available at the Central Statistics Office website (cso.ie)</p><p>The 1926 Census was the first undertaken by the newly independent Irish State, just four years after the Treaty was signed and three years after the end of the Civil War.  It is an historic collection of great value and interest for historians, researchers, the general public and Diaspora and I too look forward to its publication.</p><p>While information is available on religion, occupation and conjugal situations of the general populace, under the Statistics Act 1993, information on an individual identifiable person, cannot be released until 100 years after the date on which the census was taken.  This means that it will not be possible to publish information on individuals from the 1926 Census in 2021.</p><p>The 100 years exemption is seen by some as undermining the original guarantee of confidentiality given to householders. However, it is generally accepted that 100 years was a reasonable compromise in all the circumstances, including having regard to increasing life expectancy.</p><p>In order to make the 1926 Census available for publication, work will be required to collate, conserve, index and digitise these original census returns.  Officials from my Department, which includes the National Archives, have already carried out detailed preliminary examinations of the work required. </p><p>I fully anticipate that information relating to individuals taken in the 1926 Census will be ready for public release at the end of the statutory period in 2026 and I look forward to its release.</p></reply>

This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audio-visual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to note the impact the Government horizontal supports are continuing to have on substantially reducing the cost base for the commercial radio sector during the restrictions. A total of &euro;4.3m has been received across the industry from the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support Scheme.   Local radio has also been included in the Government&rsquo;s current advertising campaign on resilience.   </p>  <p>  The BAI continue to report to me quarterly on the Impact of COVID-19 on Commercial Radio Sector.  I recently received the quarter 3 report and I am pleased to note the small growth in advertising revenues in that  quarter.  However I recognise that the current lockdown has again had a severe impact on the sector, especially at local level. The BAI will continue to report to me on a quarterly basis and the Q4 report will help give a picture of the overall impact on the range of supports for the year.</p>  <p>  The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have been made as yet.  It must be recognised that the BAI is an statutorily independent body.  However I am aware the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the commercial radio sector to discuss the approach to Sound and Vision in the New Year and I very much welcome that. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how we can best support the sector in the coming period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-19a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900065#WRB00700"><p>The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects including swimming pools with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027.  The criteria used for scoring applications was published in advance of the assessment work commencing. Amongst the criteria used in this regard was the priority given to projects by the relevant local authority or National Governing Body of Sport, the likelihood of increasing participation or improving high performance and the level of own-funding being provided by the applicant. Following the conclusion of the application process, provisional allocations totalling &euro;77.4m for 25 projects under Stream 2 (construction) of the LSSIF were announced on 10 January 2020. On  13th January  additional provisional allocations of &euro;5m for a further 7 projects under Stream <b></b>1 (design) of the LSSIF were announced.</p><p>The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code. This process has been completed in respect of  five projects and my Department is arranging for grant agreements to issue to these projects through the Chief State Solicitor's Office.</p><p>The timeline for completing the due diligence procedure varies from project to project depending upon the  size and complexity of projects, the response time of applicants to queries raised and the quality of the material submitted in response to queries. This work is continuing and the priority in the short term is on advancing the projects allocated funding in January. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, it is planned to review progress on existing grants in 2021 when the question of whether or not it would be appropriate to seek new applications will be considered.</p></reply>

It would be remiss of Government Departments not to actively engage themselves in keeping abreast of public opinion, wherever it happens to be reported.  To not do so would be to run the risk of Government policy being developed and implemented in a vacuum, devoid of the informative, incisive and persuasive output of our nation&rsquo;s journalists, reporters and public commentators.</p>  <p>  In relation to my Department, reporting or public comment on my Department&rsquo;s activities is not outsourced or collated centrally for internal dissemination. It is the responsibility for individual Units to keep themselves informed. </p>  <p>  I have no function regarding the activities of other Government Departments in this regard.</p></reply>

These include a myriad of online performances, events such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g and a wide range of activities presented online by Ireland's National Cultural Institutions. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I introduced a Pilot Live Performance Support Scheme to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the live performance sector while also complying with public health protection measures. </p>  <p>  I recently announced the recipients of the &euro;5 million Pilot Live Performance Support Scheme with a total of 59 organisations benefitting from the scheme. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the live performance sector while also complying with public health protection measures.  The projects that are supported have already started to be presented to the public.  Last weekend saw the first live events and there will be many more over the coming weeks and covering the Christmas period.  These include pantomimes, live performance, musicians all across the State.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Live Performance Support Scheme, a project called the Music Industry Stimulus Package was managed on behalf of my Department by First Music Contact.  My Department will consider its continuation in the future.</p>  <p>  I have increased funding to the Arts Council in 2020 by over &euro;25m and increased it further, to &euro;130m for 2021.  Since the onset of COVID-19, the Arts Council has extended its reach and in 2020 has provided grants to many individuals and organisations that have not previously receive Arts Council funding. </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, there are a very wide range of supports available to individuals and businesses whose financial circumstances have been negatively impacted by COIVD-19.  The particular support depends on the institutional arrangements of the individual or organisation and whether they are a sole trader or an incorporated entity.</p></reply>

In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of taskforces and consultative fora have been established in relation to the particular difficulties facing these sectors.  Representatives from the National Governing Bodies of Sport, the live entertainment sector and stakeholders involved in large-scale conferences have been involved in these engagements.  </p>  <p>  A Working Group with representatives from the FAI, GAA, and IRFU as well as stadium operations and event managers, officials from my Department and Sport Ireland has drafted guidelines on Reopening Sportsgrounds, which are currently the subject of consultation with other relevant Departments.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has prepared guidance in respect of professional conferencing.  </p>  <p>  Separately, an umbrella group representing a number of large, purpose-built venues has drafted a high-level guidance document for use by the venues included in its group.  My Department is reviewing these documents in line with our COVID Quality Assurance Process for sectorial guidance and is in contact with the Department of Health and the Department of An Taoiseach in relation to some of these guidance documents.  </p>  <p>  A key consideration in the finalisation of any guidance is the need to ensure that the number of people allowed to attend events must be appropriate for the epidemiological situation at the time.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland remains in communication with the association on matters relating to its governance and financial management. It has established a process to oversee and review adherence by the association to the commitments given in the MOU.   </p>  <p>  To date in 2020, Sport Ireland has made total grant payments of &euro;2.45m to the association out of the total grant allocation of &euro;5.8m for football development as set out in the MOU. Only vouched expenditure under agreed headings is eligible to be drawn down by the association.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has also made total grant payments of &euro;1.9m to New Stadium DAC, the company which operates the Aviva Stadium, out of the total grant allocation of &euro;2.5446m for 2020.</p>  <p>  The processing of further payments by Sport Ireland is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Like all sporting bodies, the association has been seriously impacted by Covid-19 and it has communicated, both to me and to Sport Ireland, the financial challenges it faces as a result of Covid-19. On 2 November I announced the allocation of grant funding to address significant Covid-19 related losses for the sports sector.  &euro;13m was allocated to the association from this funding.

In light of Brexit, coupled with the economic impact of the pandemic, client companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta  will continue to need support  which is being provided on an ongoing basis by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department continue to work closely with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to ensure that the range of supports being provided by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s,  including financial and technical support and advice, align with the needs of client companies.  I am assured that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will continue to engage in this regard with its  client companies in order to further develop awareness around the supports being provided to assist companies in dealing with the implications of both COVID-19 and Brexit.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently completed a spending review and assessment of the impact of Brexit and COVID-19 on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its client companies. The work was carried out by the Evaluation Unit of my Department, which is an independent unit working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES).  </p>  <p>  My Department engaged with both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a selection of its client companies in order to complete the assessment. The findings and recommendations were considered as part of the Estimates process and resulted in significant additional exchequer funding of &euro;8.1m  being provided to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Budget 2021 -  bringing its total allocation to &euro;31.8m for the coming year.</p>  <p>  Since the formation of this Government, I have been working tirelessly with Government colleagues to mitigate against the worst of the COVID-19 impacts. To that end, in July, we announced an additional &euro;8m for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on top of the existing capital allocation of &euro;10 million for 2020. This additional funding is supporting a range of capital investments which will enhance the agency's capacity to further support the development of enterprise and is currently creating in the region of 40-50 new construction jobs throughout the Gaeltacht. It is expected that this additional  investment will ultimately support the creation of 320 new longer-term jobs in client-companies of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. </p>  <p>It is important to note also that Gaeltacht enterprises also have access to the broad range of targeted national and sectorial measures put in place by Government since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for Brexit. Furthermore, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta also has access to the schemes and funds administered by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices to ensure delivery within the Gaeltacht areas.</p></reply>

I would urge everyone who has an interest in the  period of commemorations to consult the principles and advice laid down in these publications.  </p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the State's approach to the remembrance of all of those who lost their lives during this period will be based on the respectful, sensitive, measured and authentic ethos that is core to the Decade of Centenaries programme.  </p><p>One of the cornerstones of the commemorative programme for the coming years will be to continue to further reconciliation on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  </p><p>The programme will continue to encourage reflection about the multiple identities, traditions and perspectives that are part of the overall Irish historical experience.  It will respond with sensitivity to the local historical context, acknowledging that there was no uniform experience within counties or across the island of Ireland.  </p><p>Historical accuracy, academic integrity and archival discovery will continue to be key tenets as the commemorative programme develops &ndash; following closely the centenary timeline of the events that occurred during this period.  It is important that our history is faithfully presented, even when the historical record is distressing.  We must acknowledge the great tragedy of the lives that were lost or irrevocably altered during those divisive and traumatic years. </p><p>Collaborative initiatives are currently being progressed, in co-operation with State partners, our National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning, local authorities, and creative communities.  I welcome and encourage the continuing research of historians and custodians of records, who seek to increase our understanding of the historical events that occurred, which have so significantly shaped our modern life. </p><p>Our National Cultural Institutions are uniquely positioned to offer accessible, familiar, reflective public spaces where people of all traditions can reflect on the historical events that occurred.  These safe, cultural spaces are in public ownership and, as such, I believe that they have great potential to play an enhanced role in facilitating and supporting public engagement.  </p><p>Local authorities will continue to have a very important role in driving and supporting community-led commemoration. It is clear that they have already given significant and thoughtful consideration as to how they will plan for commemorations at county and community level over the remainder of the Decade. In recognition of their leading role, I plan to significantly enhance my Department's funding supports to local authorities next year from this year's baseline allocation of &euro;10,000, in recognition of their very important contribution.  I will make further announcements in this regard in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Over 12,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas.</p><p>The most recent (2018) round of the SCP attracted a record 2,337 applications. Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April with 6 new allocations approved. </p><p>With regard to the 2020 rounds of the programme, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review.  I  intend to publish the guide to making an application and to launch the programme before the end of this month. This will include the specific details of when applications will be accepted and I expect this to be from early December. To take account of travel and other restrictions arising from the Covid pandemic I intend to give applicants until early February to complete the application process.  It is planned to make allocations later in  2021.  </p><p>Any organisation that has not already registered with the Department and wishes to apply for funding must first register on <i>www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie</i>.  Organisations must have a tax registration number from the Revenue Commissioners if they wish to register.</p></reply>

The arts are integral to our society; supporting economic activity, employment and enhancing societal well-being. The public-facing and audience driven nature of the arts means that each time there is an escalation in the Level applicable under the Plan for Living with Covid-19 these sectors are often the hardest hit. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to support our sectors through these challenging times and have been in regular and sustained contact with a broad range of stakeholders over the past weeks and months. In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of taskforces and consultative fora have been established to ensure that I have the most up to date information about the difficulties facing these sectors. This includes the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce and the Night-time Economy Taskforce. These involve a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable roadmaps for the recovery of these sectors. This engagement led to the very favourable outcomes achieved for these sectors in the context of the July Stimulus and Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the recommendations of the taskforces and the views of consultative fora in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of Covid-19. The Deputy will be aware that I put in place substantial measures in Budget 2021 to support and strengthen the arts. This engagement with stakeholders has been key in providing a comprehensive response to ameliorate the impact of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  I also established the National Cultural Institutions Consultative to ensure the necessary guidance and supports are in place to comply with the requirements of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with COVID-19 including the Expert Group on the Return to Sport.</p>  <p>  I would particularly note the important advocacy role played by the Arts Council that has worked diligently with my officials to raise awareness of the challenges facing our sectors and to identify ways to support them throughout this pandemic.</p></reply>

In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5m Sound and Vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of COVID-19.  This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent  radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.  I secured &euro;0.839m for BAI for 2021 to recoup the cost of the waiver.</p>  <p>  In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 during the summer  in a special round for the community radio sector.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Sound and Vision Scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  </p>  <p>  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audiovisual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations. The BAI are now evaluating the applications and will announce the awards to successful applicants in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I am receiving quarterly reports from the BAI in relation to the financial impacts of COVID-19 on the sector. In addition, I met the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) which represents the independent commercial radio sector,  earlier this week and have committed to engaging further with them and with the BAI to address the ongoing challenges in the sector.</p></reply>

Grants ranged from &euro;10,000 to &euro;400,000. The funds will support a variety of live events planned including concerts, pantomimes, theatre productions, festivals, outdoor performances and comedy events.</p>  <p>  The scheme was heavily oversubscribed with over 100 applications seeking funding of over &euro;16m for events which would be staged in the lead up to and during the 2020 festive period.  </p>  <p>  This was a pilot scheme and it was the first of its kind which was developed following consultation with the sector.

Local radio also plays an important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support. I recognise the challenges faced by the sector due to COVID-19 and am pleased the supports in 2020 provided a valuable source of funding at this challenging time. </p>  <p>  During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI)  held two closed rounds for radio, targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors respectively. </p>  <p>  In June 2020, the BAI awarded &euro;2.5m Sound and Vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of COVID-19.  This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.  I secured &euro;0.839m in Budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this levy waiver. </p>  <p>  In addition, the BAI distributed &euro;750,000 this year in a special round for the community radio sector.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Sound and Vision Scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely independent audio producers and public service radio. In addition, the round is open to independent audio-visual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to note the impact the Government horizontal supports are continuing to have on substantially reducing the cost base for the commercial radio sector during the restrictions. A total of &euro;4.3m has been received across the industry from the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support Scheme.   Local radio has also been included in the Government&rsquo;s current advertising campaign on resilience. </p>  <p>  The BAI continue to report to me quarterly on the Impact of COVID-19 on Commercial Radio Sector.  I recently received the quarter 3 report and I am pleased to note the small growth in advertising revenues in that  quarter.  However I recognise that the current lockdown has again had a severe impact on the sector, especially at local level. The BAI will continue to report to me on a quarterly basis and the Q4 report will help give a picture of the overall impact on the range of supports for the year.</p>  <p>  The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have been made as yet. However the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the independent radio sector  to discuss the approach to Sound and Vision in the New Year and I very much welcome that. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how we can best support the sector in the coming period.</p></reply>

The significant investment will reach all levels of the sport sector with National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and thousands of grassroots clubs across Ireland set to benefit. </p>  <p>  The funding package includes COVID-19 funding of &euro;70 million, which will provide support for the three main field sports organisations (the FAI, GAA and IRFU), a Resilience Fund to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport, a Sports Club Resilience Fund to support clubs, and a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund.</p>  <p>  The funding is being invested through grant schemes with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s recognised funding partners, including the National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and other funded sporting organisations.  Sport Ireland will not provide funding directly to sports clubs, this funding will be accessed through programmes established by each of the National Governing Bodies in receipt of funding. It is expected that the National Governing Bodies will publish details of funding allocated to clubs under these programmes in due course.  </p>  <p>Under the Sports Restart and Renewal Fund, over &euro;1.9 million was allocated to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by Local Sports Partnerships.  These schemes provide an additional mechanism to support community groups and clubs who may not be affiliated to a national organisation or recognised National Governing Body but provide a vital local service.</p></reply>

The latest Ipsos MRBI research on the &lsquo;Impact of Covid-19 Restrictions on Sport and Recreational Walking&rsquo;, carried out in July on behalf of Sport Ireland, indicated that at the peak of the pandemic restrictions, 89% of 15-24 year olds were taking part in recreational walking, compared to 51% prior to restrictions. Furthermore, 82% of 15-24 year olds indicated that they participated in Sport in the previous 7 days compared to 71% prior to restrictions. </p>  <p>  In order to support sport through the pandemic, earlier this month, Minister Martin and I announced details of an unprecedented &euro;85 million funding package for the Irish sport sector, which has been significantly impacted by the various Covid-19 restrictions imposed since March 2020.

Examples include youth leadership training and the development and dissemination of educational resource materials for parents to use to develop their skills in positively supporting children and young people&rsquo;s participation in sport. There are also plans to promote more child centred clubs and also create a coaching module that is multi-sport, and is targeted at coaches of teenage girls teams/athletes that will address the dropout of teenage girls from sport/physical activity.</p>  <p>  I will arrange for Sport Ireland to furnish a comprehensive report to the Deputy of its activities and plans in this area.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive this within ten working days.</p></reply>

As the country is currently at Level 5 no spectators are permitted at sports matches or events. However, professional and high performance sport and inter-county Gaelic games matches are permitted to take place behind closed doors.</p>  <p>  In the Government&rsquo;s Plan for living with Covid-19, it states that for very large purpose built event facilities (for example: stadia, auditoriums, conference or event centres) specific guidance will be developed with the relevant sectors to take account of size and different conditions for events such as large national and international sporting events. This applies in respect of sporting events taking place during Level 1 and 2 of the Plan.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, notwithstanding the current Level 5 restrictions, the development of this guidance remains a high priority for both Minister Martin and me. A Working Group was established in September, shortly after the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Plan, to investigate how a safe return of some spectators could be facilitated. It was comprised representatives of the FAI, GAA, and IRFU as well as stadium operations and event managers, officials from my Department and Sport Ireland. The Group reviewed international guidance, considered learning from spectator events hosted elsewhere in Europe, and consulted independent health and safety experts. The collaborative approach of the group saw contributions from all parties. I would like to thank the members of the Working Group for their efforts to date and for keeping public health at the core of its considerations.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Return to Sport has reviewed the draft guidelines and officials from my Department are currently consulting with other relevant Departments on the draft guidelines. It is my hope that this consultation will be completed in the coming weeks and that the draft guidelines can be finalised and published before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The next step would be to schedule test events, which would most likely take place in the early part of next year. However, test events can be held only if we are at Levels 1 and 2.  Any lessons that may be learned at test events would be fed into updated guidance and advice for further events. Thereafter, the operation of spectator events here and overseas would be subject to constant monitoring and the guidance updated as appropriate.</p>  <p>  I would like to emphasise that at this stage the guidance is in draft form only and no decisions have yet been made on any test events. It is my hope that once completed the guidelines for sports stadiums will inform the development of tailored guidance applicable to other facilities like performance spaces and conference centres, and to facilitate a limited return for patrons at live music and other artistic performances.</p></reply>

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities, including non-elite sporting activity by children and adults. It is noteworthy in that context however that sports training activity by children under the age of 18 is permitted in highly controlled settings under the current Level 5 restrictions.  </p>  <p>While it is encouraging to note that COVID-19 data indicates improvements across a range of indicators, which gives us hope that the epidemiological situation is once again coming under control, it is too early at this point to consider the easing of restrictions.  The suite of measures to be applied after the current period of restrictions, including for the sport sector, will be decided by Government on the basis of the prevailing public health situation and in the context of the Framework published in September.</p></reply>

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities, including sporting activity.</p>  <p>  While it is encouraging to note that COVID-19 data indicates improvements across a range of indicators, which gives us hope that the epidemiological situation is once again coming under control, it is too early at this point to consider the easing of restrictions. The current Level 5 restrictions will continue until 2 December. The suite of measures to be applied thereafter, including for the sport sector, will be decided by Government on the basis of the prevailing public health situation and in the context of the Framework published in September.</p>  <p>The Government recognises the impacts COVID-19 and the related public health measures are having on our mental health and well-being. The &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; campaign, launched on 29th October, is aimed at showing people of all ages how we can mind our own physical and mental health and well-being by adding healthy and helpful habits to our daily and weekly routines. It provides guidelines, information, and tips on things that will help us keep well through the coming months and into 2021. All of this is available on gov.ie/healthyireland.</p></reply>

The public health risk at level 5 means that we are all asked to stay at home, with limited exceptions.  Information on the public health measures in currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/</i>.  At all times the priority guiding the plan will be to keep our schools open, while keeping people safe and protecting the resilience of our economy and communities.</p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020 give effect to level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  The Regulations list essential retail and essential services which may operate under level 5 restrictions.</p><p>The Government has yet to make a decision on the restrictions will apply after 1 December as that will depend on the epidemiological situation at the time.  The impact of any and all restrictions for every sector, including dance, will be considered carefully as the Government seeks to balance the public health risk posed by COVID with economic, social and well-being considerations.</p></reply>

The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Due to businesses having had to close, we have made changes to the PUP and the EWSS. The PUP includes an increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. The EWSS has also been aligned with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>A six-month reduction in VAT was introduced, going down from 23% to 21%, and the 13.5% VAT rate down to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy. </p><p>The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), was recently launched through Revenue, offering a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week. </p><p>Also in Budget 2021, provision has been made for &euro;10m in funding for the Online Retail Scheme next year.

The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors. There have been a total of 131 in-person site visits and 101 E-visits nationally as of the third quarter and this is the latest data available.</p>  <p>My Department and the IDA are continuing to work hard to attract further investment to all regions, despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Agency continues to work closely with their clients to drive further investment and job creation to the region.</p></reply>

However I have committed in our new Waste Action Plan to review the regulation of textile collection banks for compatibility with the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Improved transparency and traceability around the collection of these materials should increase the volume of textiles that are retained in Ireland to the benefit of local charities and communities.</p></reply>

Significantly more residual waste is now used as a fuel (energy recovery) than disposed to landfill. Further information is available at <i> </i></p><p>New waste management targets in the EU Landfill Directive require Member States to reduce the amount of municipal waste going to landfill to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight) by 2035. In addition, amendments to the Waste Framework Directive require that recycling rates of 55%, 60% and 65% of municipal waste (by weight) must be achieved by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively. </p><p>I launched the <i>Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy</i>in September. This represents a step change in our approach to waste in Ireland, as it shifts the focus away from management to a fuller reconsideration of how we use resources and materials.  The measures in the Plan are intended to minimise the amount of waste generated, eliminating waste before it can be created and diverting as much as possible to beneficial reuse or recovery and will help us deliver on our national targets.</p></reply>

The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources.  The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) that underpinned the OREDP found that 4,500 MW of offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal generation could be sustainably developed in Irish waters in the period to 2030. The OREDP can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.decc.gov.ie</i>).Work has commenced on updating the 2014 Plan. This updated OREDP will identify the optimal locations for offshore renewable energy (ORE) development on Ireland's coasts by carrying out a resource assessment for wind, wave and tidal conditions in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This will also take account of new information collected on the offshore resource since 2014 and will model potential capacity in the Irish EEZ. This work will provide an evidence base for the assessment of zones or areas suitable for deployment of wind, wave and tidal technologies, which will then be input into marine spatial planning work underway by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The outcomes from the OREDP2 will then enable relevant departments to assess the potential opportunities for development of ports and harbours in the context of marine renewables.</p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>As of 9 November, over 126,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed by NBI, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.  </p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>In County Cavan, surveying has taken place in Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles, Caughoo, Belturbet, Killashandra and Butler&rsquo;s Bridge. Building works are taking place outside Cavan town including at Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles and in the south of the county at Caughoo. Indicative dates targeted by NBI to connect these circa. 3,700 premises are between February and April of 2021. </p><p>In County Monaghan, surveying has taken place in Cornacassa, Cortolvin, Ballybay, and Stranooden. Indicative dates targeted by NBI to connect these circa. 4,300 premises are between August and October of 2021. Other areas which will be surveyed in 2020 include Mullinahinch, Bellanode, Drumhilock, Tydavnet, Cloughnart, Scotstown and Killymarley.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cavan and Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 November, some 190  BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 22 schools are live with high speed broadband for educational access only.</p><p>In Cavan, Castlerahan Community Centre BCP site is now live, with Gallonray House Gallonreagh Maudabawn, Kildallan Parish Hall,  Killenkere Leisure Centre, Castle Saunderson Scout Centre, Bunnoe Community Centre and Drumavaddy Community Centre installed by NBI and awaiting connection.</p><p>In Monaghan, BCP sites connected include Saint Alphonsus Community Hall, Ballybay Wetlands, Latton Resource Centre with further BCPs installed by NBI and awaiting connection at Corduff Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Corcaghan Community Centre, Carn Resource Centre and Mullyash Community Centre.

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.  </p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 9 November 2020, over 126,000 premises across every county in Ireland have been surveyed, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Of this figure 16,432 premises have been surveyed in County Cork including Midleton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick. Surveying involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. </p><p>NBI crews have started initial works for the build covering approximately 4,000 premises in the Carrigaline area including Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick. The first fibre to the home connections are expected this month in Carrigaline and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.</p><p>Further details are available on specific premises within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website<i>www.nbi.ie</i>. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 November, some 147 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>In County Cork, BCPs have been connected  at  Ballindangan, Aghabullogue, Castletownkenneigh, Lissavard and Whitechurch Community Centres and T.O. Park Labbamollga Community Facility. NBI have also installed BCP infrastructure which will be connected in the coming weeks at Bere Island Heritage Centre and Laharn Heritage Centre.</p><p>Clogagh and Ballycroneen National Schools will also be connected, for educational access only, as part of the BCP initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. </p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. </p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p></reply>

The serious decline in the volume of mail and the impact of Covid on footfall through post offices, has had a severe impact on the postal network and I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Postmasters Union. I am also aware of the findings of the most recent Grant Thornton Report commissioned by the IPU, which are being considered by my Department.  I am meeting with the IPU in the coming weeks to discuss the matters raised.</p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. </p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done since An Post put in place a Strategic Plan, covering the period 2017 &ndash; 2021, in response to the structural challenges faced by the postal sector. </p>  <p>  In order to implement the Plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150m, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30m to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). </p>  <p>  As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.</p></reply>

This intervention alone will result in: </p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Since the delivery stage of the project commenced in October 2019, five 150kW High Power Chargers have been installed at Galway Plaza (M6), Kilcullen (M9), Park R&iacute; (M3), Kells, and Portlaoise Plaza (M7/8). These locations now have a 50kW charger in addition to the 150kW Charger and can charge three cars simultaneously. All of these locations are new sites. Preliminary works are underway for similar capacity at several other locations throughout the country. </p><p>To date, the CAF project has also seen the replacement of 14 AC Standard Chargers with 50kW DC chargers throughout the country. These will provide Fast Charging facilities where there was none previously. Depending on the specific site, these chargers can provide up to 50kW DC power or up to 22kW AC power. Since the beginning of the project upgrades to charging infrastructure have also been carried out at the following locations: Ballina, Cavan, Clifden, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dublin Port, Dundalk, Galway, Kells, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tullamore, Waterford and Westport. More upgrades are planned in the coming months, including in Cork, Kenmare, Tralee and Waterford.</p><p>Further details on the ESB project can be found at <i></i></p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support. I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at 33 Tesco locations around the country in the last number of months. More than 50 of these are planned in total. My Department is also making &euro;2 million available next year through the SEAI to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging. </p><p>In terms of maintenance, ESB ecars employ a Charge Point Management System to monitor the performance of its charger network. This IT system provides real time overview of the performance of the network, usage and can allow certain tasks to be carried out remotely in the event of an issue arising. The performance of the network is monitored by a specialist Operations Team. In addition, ESB ecars Maintenance Contractors carry out a number of proactive maintenance visits to each charger on an annual basis. Customers can also avail of a 24/7 customer call centre should they have any issue and can report an issue with a charger through the ESB ecar app &ldquo;ecar connect&rdquo;. </p><p>The below table is a list of ESB charge points per county including the newly installed Tesco charge points;</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Standard Charge Points (up to 22kW)</th>       <th>Fast Chargers (c. 50kW)</th>       <th>High Powered Chargers (150 kW)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>4</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>2</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>4</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>156</td>       <td>15</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>4</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>5</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>2</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>2</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>56</td>       <td>6</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>690</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of EVs, who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs. Since the launch of the scheme, the SEAI has received requests from twelve local authorities for applications under the scheme with two completed applications from Louth County Council and Dublin City Council currently being assessed for approval to install a total of 24 charge points within their administrative areas. In addition, the four Dublin local authorities are currently examining their approach for a network of charging infrastructure in the metropolitan area. My Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers.</p></reply>

A SAR Aviation Steering Group chaired by the Director of the Irish Coast Guard was established last year to manage this process with a view to ensuring the next service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.  As key stakeholders, the Department of Defence and the Air Corps are fully engaged in these deliberations, including as members of this Steering Group.</p>  <p>  The Group meets regularly for updates on the procurement and to input on the direction of the process. It receives progress reports on the project plan at regular intervals identifying where interactions with stakeholders/ potential bidders have taken place. </p>  <p>  As a first step in the Public Spending Code process, a Strategic Assessment and Preliminary Appraisal was prepared by my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Research and Analysis Division in close consultation with the Steering Group and in line with so-called &ldquo;Gate 0&rdquo; of the Public Spending Code. Having been agreed by the Steering Group, this went to Government for information in July.   </p>  <p>  This assessment included a strategic assessment, setting out the strategic context for SAR aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme. It identified the spending objectives of the programme including existing arrangements and relevant business needs; it applied the Programme Logic Model to look at potential scope and key service requirements; and identified benefits, risks, constraints and dependencies. It also included a Service Specification Framework, including critical success factors, an Options Framework and a Service Specification. It also conducted a preliminary options filtering looking at potential Service Delivery Models and Service Providers. It made some recommendations in this regard. It also touched on issues relating to governance and procurement.  </p>  <p>  As regards the preliminary filtering of options, this took account of considerations in relation to the risks, affordability and deliverability. Given that the decision-making process in relation to this is still on-going and will lead to a Government decision ultimately, it is not appropriate to release any specific details in relation to this Strategic Assessment nor the considerations around any one of the options considered as part of the Preliminary Appraisal process.  </p>  <p>  The next step in the procurement process is a detailed business case which is currently being prepared for Government. Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next service will be a matter for Government once the detailed business case has been finalised.  The timeframe for this will depend on various factors but it is expected that a memorandum will be brought to Government in Q1 2021.</p>  <p>  In the interests of transparency, updates on the process are provided via the Government's etenders.ie website and a dedicated webpage.</p></reply>

These travellers do not need to restrict their movements when performing the essential function related to their travel, for example attending a close family member's funeral, or conducting an important business meeting that cannot be held virtually. For the moment, following the outbreak of a new strain of COVID-19 in Denmark associated with mink farms, passengers travelling from Denmark are advised to self isolate for 14 days regardless of the essential nature of their journey. This requirement does not apply to international transport workers in the aviation, maritime and road haulage sectors.</p>  <p>  The advice for those arriving from EU orange regions is that if they have a negative COVID-19 test result from a test taken up to three days before departure, they are not expected to restrict movements on arrival. </p>  <p>  From midnight 29th November, arrivals from an EU red/grey region and third countries will not be expected to restrict movements following receipt of a negative/not-detected result from a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken a minimum of five days after arrival in Ireland. This provision will also be available to arrivals from orange regions who may not have availed of a pre-departure test. </p>  <p>  There are a number of COVID-19 testing technologies currently available or emerging on the commercial market. However, subject to the ongoing review of testing by NPHET and Government, a negative result from a COVID-19 PCR test is the only test result that means the passenger is not expected to follow advice to restrict movements. Testing technology and delivery options for facilitating international travel will be kept under review. </p>  <p>  The Passenger Locator Form, administered by the Department of Health, remains in place for all persons arriving into the State regardless of the "colour" of the location they are arriving from.  Essential transport workers continue to be exempt from completing the form.  The introduction of an online form supports an enhanced system of engagements with arriving passengers. The main purpose of the form is for the targeting of key public health messages to arriving passengers through SMS and email.</p></reply>

New Regulations were also introduced making mandatory the wearing of face coverings on public transport, with some limited exceptions.  </p>  <p>  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p>  <p>  The Government is also spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector in order to support the continued operation of necessary services, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation.  The Exchequer is now funding the PSO (public service obligation) regime far in excess of the allocation that had been provided under Budget 2020.  In addition, the Government introduced a new temporary funding support for the non-PSO (licensed, commercial) bus sector in respect of its continuation of necessary scheduled bus services. The Government also provided additional funding for enhancements to certain PSO bus services announced under the Stimulus package.</p>  <p>  While most public transport in Ireland comprises the bus and rail services funded through the National Transport Authority's (NTA) public service obligation (PSO) programme, there is part of the national public transport system that comprises non-subvented bus services, which are run on a commercial and competitive basis by bus and coach businesses of varying sizes throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy that both the NTA and my Department have been engaging directly with commercial bus operators throughout the crisis to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we continue to deal with the impact of Covid-19. In this context, my Department has been liasing with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) since early May - ten meetings have taken place, the most recent being the 6th November 2020.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for PSO services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector as I have outlined. </p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of the year and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p></reply>

They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>The CRSS is being implemented by the Revenue Commissioners who have shown as an organisation that they are very effective in operating schemes to support businesses in this crisis. </p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is at Committee Stage of the legislative process this week but I have no plans to extend the scheme.</p></reply>

The scheme was not intended as a support to domestic employers nor was it ever implied that it applied to them.   </p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Revenue also deployed very significant resources to a TWSS Helpline to ensure employers were supported to the greatest extent possible through telephone and written (including e-mail) engagement.  </p>  <p>  The provision of domestic duties by an employee within a private household, where the employer is the owner or occupier is not a business activity. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing domestic staff. It is also not possible for a domestic employer to meet the &lsquo;25% turnover&rsquo; eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging a domestic employee.</p>  <p>  In the event that domestic employers, or indeed any employers, received TWSS payments to which they were not entitled, it is important that they engage with Revenue and agree repayment arrangements. Where this does not happen, it may result in Revenue raising assessments and initiating recovery procedures.</p></reply>

From 1 January 2019 qualifying companies can submit applications for eligible EII/SURE investments on a self-assessment basis. This means that a company that wishes to claim EII/SURE no longer needs advance approval from Revenue. A company can satisfy itself that it qualifies for EII/SURE and, accordingly, obtain certification on a self-assessment basis via the Revenue Online Service (&lsquo;ROS&rsquo;). </p><p>For all investments both prior to the changes in Finance Act 2018 and after, a company cannot apply or make a claim for relief until 30% of the amount raised has been spent on a qualifying purpose. A company has two years from the end of the year in which the share issue took place to spend this amount.</p><p>For investments made on or before 31 December 2018 Revenue certification is still required. As a company has two years from the end of the year in which the share issue took place to apply for certification, Revenue will continue to receive applications for 2018 share issues until 31 December 2020. </p><p>Relief for EII investments on or before 8 October 2019 is granted in two tranches. The first portion of the relief (30/40) is given at the time of investment, while the second portion (10/40) is given if, after 3 years, the company has increased employment or spent all of the money on qualifying research and development.  In addition, for investments made on or before 31 December 2018, Revenue certification is still required for the second portion when the relevant period has ended. As such Revenue may still receive applications for share issues taking place on or before 31 December 2018 until 31 December 2023.</p><p>A company can make an application each time it issues shares as a result of a qualifying investment. This may mean that a company could have multiple applications in a year. Revenue will record each application by reference to the share issue date. The numbers set out below relate to the number of applications, being each separate share issue, rather than each separate company. Each application, by reference to each share issue, is treated as a separate application and may or may not receive certification based on its own merits.</p><p>The following are details of applications approved in the years 2015 to 2018:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>EII</th>       <th>SCS/SURE</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>268</td>       <td>33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>306</td>       <td>80</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>177</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For claims for relief for share issues in 2019 and 2020, it is the responsibility of the company which has received the investment to submit a return under self-assessment. The information Revenue currently has for relief claimed for EII and SURE is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Self-Assessment</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>128</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>29</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In providing information in relation to EII and SURE, Revenue publishes guidance on how applications can be made. It is not Revenue practice to provide details of unsuccessful applications, which may be unsuccessful for a wide variety of case-specific reasons.</p><p>For investments made on or before 31 December 2018, Revenue records applications in the year in which they are received. As previously noted, applications for relief can be made by a company over a number of years. Therefore, the number of applications received in a year is not reflective of share issues that actually took place in that year, e.g. a company has a February 2018 share issue but the required 30% is only spent by May 2020. It is only from May 2020 onwards that the company can submit the application for certification.</p><p>Revenue changed how cases were recorded in September 2018. The information Revenue can provide relates to applications on hand at September 2018 and received since that date.</p><p>The number of applications, as set out below, are for investments made on or before 31 December 2018.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Applications Received</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>360</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>354</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>301</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>By way of example, of the 354 applications received in 2019, this includes EII first tranche applications, second tranche applications and SURE applications. </p><p>As previously noted, companies have until the end of 2020 to apply for the first tranche of relief for investments made on or before 31 December 2018 and until the end of 2023 to apply for the second tranche of relief and, as such, this number is not final.</p><p>Finally, in my budget speech last month, I announced that my Department will this year initiate an assessment of how the EII scheme can be enhanced in the light of the current crisis.Preparations are already underway in this regard and next month it is proposed to launch a consultation process where stakeholders will be invited to submit their views and suggestions to the Department in writing with a particular focus on the following:</p><p>- improved support for start-ups,</p><p>- the potential to attract capital from a broader range of investors, and</p><p>- the potential to include certain energy-related projects within the remit of the scheme.</p></reply>

The charge for credit cards is for the account and not the number of cards issued to that account.</p><p>The rate for charge cards is &euro;30 per year for each charge card issued to an account.</p><p>Financial institutions will generally collect Stamp Duty on credit and charge cards on 1 April, in arrears, unless the account was closed during the preceding 12 months during the year. The tax year for credit cards normally runs from 2 April to the following 1 April.</p><p>The stamp duty on credit cards is not linked to usage in any way. Therefore, where a credit card has not been used over the course of the applicable tax year, the &euro;30 stamp duty will be applied at the end of that period. This means that, a cardholder of a credit card account is liable to the &euro;30 stamp duty, irrespective of usage of the card concerned. </p><p>As part of an ongoing and evolving package of measures which is being taken by the Government in order to mitigate the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on individuals and businesses, I announced the deferral of the collection date for the stamp duty on credit cards from 1 April 2020 to 1 July 2020 on 18 March this year.  It is anticipated that the collection dates will revert to normal (1 April) next year. The stamp duty collected on 1 July 2020 was in respect of the period 2 April 2019 to 1 April 2020. </p><p>The focus of Government in response to the pandemic has been around income supports and business supports to assist employees, households and businesses.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have also been proactive in working with taxpayers to resolve their tax payments difficulties in the current circumstances.The positive actions taken include the suspension of interest and enforcement actions, as well as deferral of payment dates such as the extension of the date for deduction of Local Property Tax for customers who use annual debit payment options and the collection date for stamp duty on credit cards.  Where the payment or collection date for a tax is deferred, the assessment period remains the same and is provided for in the relevant tax legislation.</p><p>I have no plans to suspend or defer the collection of the stamp duty on ATM or combined cards, or to further defer or suspend the &euro;30 stamp duty on credit cards.</p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.    </p>  <p>  If the scheme applies to visitors from Britain post-Brexit and if the UK were to operate a similar scheme for EU visitors, Irish consumers would be able to buy goods VAT free in Britain and visitors from Britain would be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland.  This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases in both directions, resulting in significant VAT revenue losses; purchases by UK visitors in Ireland would not produce any VAT revenues and collecting VAT on goods in excess of personal importation allowances brought into Ireland by consumers would be extremely difficult. The UK has announced its intention to exclude EU visitors from their Retail Export Scheme. It was always my intention to adopt reciprocal measures in Ireland to the greatest extent possible if the UK adopted such restrictions and that remains my position.  These restrictions, in Ireland and Britain, will help avoid tax driven displacement of consumer spending and protect tax revenues. Revenue has also advised that with the volume of travel normally between Britain and Ireland, and the volume of Retail Export Scheme claims that would be likely to arise, there would be significant scope for abuse, with purchases of goods for use in Ireland presented as being for export.  </p>  <p>  The measures contained in the Brexit Bill do not eliminate the use of the VAT Retail Export Scheme for UK residents, post Brexit.  Instead, they provide a legal basis to control and minimise the scope for abuse of the scheme.  The Bill as published provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The Bill also introduces a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties facing retailers, especially businesses in the tourism sector, I am bringing forward an amendment at committee stage to reduce the threshold to &euro;75. This reduction retains protections for the exchequer while also acknowledging the potential impact that not making this change would have on retailers across the country at this difficult time.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p><p>AIB has provided me with the following statement:</p><p>&quot;The Irish banking industry responded rapidly to the pandemic by implementing one of the most extensive payment break programmes in Europe, available to all customers impacted by Covid-19. </p><p>&quot;These moratoria do not trigger a forbearance classification, in line with the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on moratoria applied in the light of Covid-19, issued on April 2, 2020. </p><p>&quot;On September 21st, 2020, the EBA issued further guidance on the phasing out of payment breaks. After the deadline of September 30th 2020, banks can continue to support customers with payment breaks but such cases are subject to the standard prudential framework and assessed for forbearance. </p><p>&quot;Payment breaks provided short term relief for customers who suffered a temporary income reduction, but where a customer suffers an income impact over a prolonged period, a longer term sustainable solution may be required. This does not diminish the possibility of the bank granting payment break extensions where appropriate on a case by case basis. </p><p>&quot;The bank&rsquo;s focus is on engagement, assessment, and solutions for those most impacted financially by the Covid-19 pandemic and agreeing individually tailored plans that will help customers manage what is a challenging and stressful situation.&quot;</p></reply>

My main goal is to ensure a close coordination of economic policies across the euro area so as to promote growth.</p><p>I am very pleased with the progress made in my first few months as President of Eurogroup in what are exceptionally challenging times.  Indeed the strong European response to Covid-19 to date, perfectly illustrates the power and importance of coordinated action &ndash; our European economies will only grow if we support each other and no individual efforts can be as effective as joint action. This is illustrated in the three safety nets agreed by the Eurogroup in response to COVID-19, all of which are now in place: the SURE (the temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks), the EIB (European Investment Bank) guarantee fund and the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) Pandemic Crisis Support Instrument.</p><p>A central part of my candidacy for President of the Eurogroup was my vision for an inclusive and transparent Eurogroup. Reflecting this, I identified the priorities for my two and a half year term in close consultation with my Finance Minister colleagues. The publicly available work programme up to June 2021 reflects these. </p><p>In brief these are:</p><p>- Fostering economic and fiscal policies to support recovery and long-term growth including discussions on draft budgetary plans and broader economic developments.</p><p>- Strengthening Banking Union: Completing the Banking Union in a holistic manner and on a consensual basis is a key priority.</p><p>- Digital Euro: The Eurogroup will carefully examine the ongoing impact a potential Digital Euro will have on euro area economies in order to safeguard financial stability and monetary sovereignty, while remaining at the forefront of innovation and supporting growth.</p><p>- International role of the euro: The euro is a global currency and the Eurogroup will continue to monitor carefully the potential opportunities and advantages but also the risks of an enhanced international role of the euro.</p><p>Further details of these priority areas, as well as the work programme (which was agreed last month), are publicly available on the Eurogroup website at: <i></i>/</p></reply>

This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities including cultural activities.</p>  <p>  At present, Ireland is at Level 5 of The Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.  The public health risk at level 5 means that we are all asked to stay at home, with limited exceptions.  Information on the public health measures currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020 give effect to level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  The Regulations list essential retail and essential services which may operate under level 5 restrictions.  This list does not include private or commercial dance classes.  Under the Regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Similarly, The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, regardless of the form e.g. Irish, ballet, jazz etc.  </p>  <p>  I fully understand the benefits that activities such as dance bring to peoples overall health and well-being. The measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking the right balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. Such activities include health and social care services, education and other essential needs, work and economic activity, and other key societal interests in so far as possible.</p></reply>

The Online Safety Commissioner will have the power to designate online services for regulation and to create and enforce binding online safety codes.  These will seek to minimise the availability of harmful online content through oversight of the systems that online services use to deliver and moderate content. The regulator will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including financial sanctions.</p>  <p>  At that time the Government also approved the detailed drafting of the proposed Bill by the Office of the Attorney General (AGO) and forwarded the General Scheme to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and Environment for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Due to the dissolution of the Dail and Committees in January, pre-legislative scrutiny did not commence.  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the proposed Bill was transferred to my Department on 22 September 2020.  Detailed drafting of the Bill by the AGO is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Government approval will be sought shortly for the finalisation of General Scheme of the proposed Bill through the addition to the provisions relating to the funding of the Media Commission, the regulation of audiovisual media services, the maximum amount for financial sanctions for non-compliance and other matters.  These additional provisions, when approved, will be forwarded to the AGO for drafting  and to the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is for the Committee to determine whether and when to commence such scrutiny.   At this time, the finalised General Scheme will also be notified to the European Commission for a technical conformity assessment with relevant EU law regarding regulations on online services. </p>  <p>  The enactment of the proposed Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is a commitment in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

On  13th January additional provisional allocations of &euro;5m for a further 7 projects under Stream<b></b>1 (design) of the LSSIF were announced. Of these 32 grants, 8 swimming pool projects have been awarded funding.</p><p>The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the successful projects will undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate to comply with the Public Spending Code. This work is continuing and the priority in the short term is on advancing the projects allocated funding in January. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, it is planned to review progress on existing grants in 2021 when the question of whether or not it would be appropriate to seek new applications will be considered.</p><p>In relation to smaller capital projects, the Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCP and to prioritise the investment in disadvantaged areas. A full Review of the latest (2018) round of the SCP has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review.  I  intend to publish the guide to making an application and to launch the new round of the programme before the end of this month. This will include the specific details of when applications will be accepted but I expect this to be from early December. To take account of travel and other restrictions arising from the Covid pandemic I intend to give applicants until early February to complete the application process.</p></reply>

I have had bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department.  I have set up a number of taskforces and consultative for a to ensure that I have the most up to date information about the difficulties facing these sectors. This includes the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce and the Night-time Economy Taskforce, involving a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable roadmaps for the recovery of these sectors. The quality and depth of these engagement led to favourable outcomes for the sectors in the July Stimulus and in Budget 2021. I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the recommendations of the taskforces and the views of consultative fora in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of Covid-19.  </p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has funded a wide range of activities in the arts and cultural sphere, many of which involve the online presentation of events that would normally have taken place live and in-person. These include a myriad of online performances, events such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g and a wide range of activities presented online by Ireland's National Cultural Institutions. </p><p>I would particularly note the important advocacy role played by the Arts Council that has worked diligently with my officials to raise awareness of the challenges facing our sectors and to identify ways to support them throughout this pandemic. I have increased funding to the Arts Council in 2020 by over &euro;25m and increased it further, to &euro;130m for 2021.  Since the onset of COVID-19, the Arts Council has extended its reach and in 2020 has provided grants to many individuals and organisations that have not previously receive Arts Council funding.  The increases reflects Government's acknowledgement of the important role that arts and culture play in our economy and society and recognises the devastating impact COVID-19 restrictions have had on the sector.</p><p>In Budget 2021, the Government announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector.  This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country.  The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders.It will also be informed by a pilot Live Performance Support Scheme now rolled out, to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances to provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  </p><p>The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce set up in response to the Programme for Government has now reported.  Along with Chair Clare Duignan, the members of the Taskforce brought together a depth knowledge and experience.  The Taskforce makes 10 recommendations for survival until the sector opens up again and to retain the expertise of the creative, technical, production and support workforce so there are still arts, culture and entertainment events for audiences to enjoy in better times.

The Taskforce comprised an independent chairperson and 13 other members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds including tourism policy, tourism enterprise, international, private and public service. During the course of its work, the TRT carried out a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby all sectors and interested parties could provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this sector vital to our economy can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way. </p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement with stakeholders, the Taskforce undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the sector and drew up a Recovery Plan containing over 30 recommendations across a number of areas designed to help the sector to survive and recover from the crisis out to 2023. Its short-term recommendations informed the sector-specific measures adopted in the Budget. These measures will help tourism enterprises to survive and subsequently contribute to the recovery. Key measures adopted in Budget 2021, further to the horizontal measures such as the EWSS and CRSS and measures previously introduced like the &lsquo;stay and spend&rsquo; tax credit and adaptation grants, are: </p>  <p>  - A Business Continuity Scheme of &euro;55 million for strategic tourism businesses; </p>  <p>  - A reduced VAT rate of 9%, and</p>  <p>  - Funding of &euro;5 million for focused upskilling training to support business survival and recovery in the sector, and for the improvement of the digital presence and ecommerce capability of tourism businesses.  </p>  <p>  The plan was published at the start of October and to help inform the ongoing response to the pandemic, I will shortly appoint an Oversight Group which will monitor the implementation of the Recovery Plan as well as the recovery of the tourism sector in general.</p></reply>

The engagement has taken many forms from virtual one to one meetings with National Governing Bodies of sport to larger group meetings, also conducted virtually. There are two main groups which engage with the sector, they are the &ldquo;Expert Group on Return to Sport&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Covid-19 Sport Monitoring Group".</p>  <p>  To facilitate the safe return of sporting activity, an Expert Group was established to provide advice and guidance to sporting bodies and to review protocols to ensure they are in compliance with public health advice. The Expert Group has had 24 meetings (up to and including Thursday 12 November) and has approved over 55 protocols from sporting bodies and other relevant organisations. In addition, the Expert Group has developed extensive guidance for the sport sector on assessing and mitigating the risk of infection at sports training and competitive events. I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to all members of the Group for their efforts which have facilitated a safe return to sport for children and adults.</p>  <p>  The other main group which interacts with the sports sector is the Covid-19 Sports Monitoring Group. This group has met 8 times, most recently on Friday 6 November. I chair this group which comprises Department Officials, Sport Ireland and a broad range of stakeholders in sport such as National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships as well as other partners including the Federation of Irish Sport, the Olympic Federation of Ireland, Paralympics Ireland and Ireland Active. The group serves as a forum for the stakeholders to engage directly with the Minister on issues of concern for their members, such as the impacts of public health regulations, the challenges facing sports clubs and the economic impact of the pandemic on Ireland&rsquo;s sport and leisure sector.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the challenges of COVID-19 will continue into 2021, I can assure the Deputy that Minister Martin and I will continue our engagement with and support the sporting bodies.</p></reply>

The significant investment will reach all levels of the sport sector with National Governing Bodies, Local Sports Partnerships and thousands of grassroots clubs across Ireland set to benefit. </p><p>The funding package includes COVID-19 funding of &euro;70 million, which will provide support for the three main field sports organisations (the FAI, GAA and IRFU), a Resilience Fund to support the National Governing Bodies of Sport, a Sports Club Resilience Fund to support clubs, and a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund.</p><p>The funding is being invested through grant schemes with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s recognised funding partners, including the National Governing Bodies of Sport, Local Sports Partnerships and other funded sporting organisations.  Sport Ireland will not provide funding directly to sports clubs, this funding will be accessed through programmes established by each of the National Governing Bodies in receipt of funding. It is expected that the National Governing Bodies will publish details of funding allocated to clubs under these programmes in due course.  </p><p>Under the Sports Restart and Renewal Fund, over &euro;1.9 million was allocated to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by Local Sports Partnerships.  These schemes provide an additional mechanism to support community groups and clubs who may not be affiliated to a national organisation or recognised National Governing Body but provide a vital local service.  </p><p>In recent contacts with the sport sector, it has been made clear that the financial and operational challenges associated with COVID-19 will continue into 2021. I am pleased to have secured an additional &euro;26.25 million in the 2021 budget which will ensure that Sport Ireland can continue to support our valued sport sector next year. </p><p>In regard to the Sports Capital Programme, a full Review of the 2018 round has now been completed and the terms and conditions of the 2020 round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review.  I  intend to publish the guide to making an application and to launch the programme before the end of this month. This will include the specific details of when applications will be accepted but I expect this to be from early December. To take account of travel and other restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic I intend to give applicants until early February to complete the application process.  It is planned to make allocations later in  2021.  </p><p>Any organisation that has not already registered with the Department and wishes to apply for funding must first register on <i>www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie</i>.  Organisations must have a tax registration number from the Revenue Commissioners if they wish to register.</p></reply>

Despite the challenges this year Culture Ireland advanced several innovations to promote Irish arts and culture through online events such as Ireland Performs, where 120 artists presented individual events from their locality and reached a global  audience of almost 1 million.  </p>  <p>  Culture Ireland continues to showcase Irish artists to international promoters with the aim of creating future touring for Irish artists.

My Department&rsquo;s Twitter feed has 12,500 followers, the Facebook page has 8,250 followers and 6,800 people follow my Department&rsquo;s activities on Instagram.  </p><p>The stories and content broadcast daily across these electronic social media platforms are all devised and delivered by my officials, who regularly collaborate with Cultural Institutions, Festivals, Events, artists and schemes to ensure a steady stream of engaging, colourful and relevant stories, photography and short-form video for public presentation across the social media platforms.  </p><p>My officials also regularly create social media content in Irish, and about life, sports and culture in the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>The public response to this activity has been strong, and followers and engagement levels continue to grow across my Department&rsquo;s platforms.  </p><p>In addition, Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is charged with promoting Irish arts worldwide, creating and supporting opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues. In 2020, in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19, it has supported the presentation of outstanding Irish work to international audiences, through online showcases at key global arts events, promoted through social media. There is also wide ranging use of social media by bodies under the aegis of the Department to host and promote Irish arts and culture events to a global audience.</p><p>Earlier this year, in direct response to the devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural sector, my Department harnessed the reach of electronic social media to deliver an innovative approach to ensuring that citizens could continue to access arts and Irish culture, despite curtailments on audiences and gatherings, and also to ensure that artists could still connect with their audiences in Ireland and around the world.  </p><p>The Cultural programme developed included:  </p><p>Ireland Performs  :  A partnership with Facebook: 120 live online performances by Irish artists from their homes, supported by Culture Ireland. This attracted a global audience of 821,000 people over the six weeks of its run.  </p><p>Courage programme:A series of live concerts (online and RT&Eacute;) broadcast from a number of National Cultural Institutions, and other landmark venues, delivered by Other Voices with support from my Department.

Tourism, Arts and Culture, Gaeltacht and the Irish language, Media and Sport are integral to our society; supporting economic activity, as well as enhancing physical, mental and societal well-being. The public-facing and audience driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation in the Level applicable under the Plan for Living with Covid-19 these sectors are often the hardest hit. </p><p>The impact of COVID is ongoing and it is too early to say with certainty what the total impact will be. </p><p>I am however acutely aware of the need to support our sectors through these challenging times and have been in regular and sustained contact with a broad range of stakeholders over the past weeks and months. In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of taskforces and consultative fora have been established to ensure that I have the most up to date information about the difficulties facing these sectors. This includes the Tourism Recovery Taskforce, the Tourism Hospitality Forum, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, the Night-time Economy Taskforce, and the Sports Monitoring Group. These involve a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable roadmaps for the recovery of these sectors. Both the Tourism and Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforces have reported at this stage and I will continue to work with stakeholders on their implementation. </p><p>This broad sectorial engagement has led to the very favourable outcomes achieved for these sectors in the context of both the July Stimulus and Budget 2021.  Some of the key measures have been introduced in 2020 to help the sectors my Department supports, include:</p><p>- An additional &euro;25m for the Arts Council;</p><p>- A &euro;5m Live Events Pilot Grant Scheme;</p><p>- &euro;5m to support the NCI&rsquo;s and nationwide arts infrastructure;</p><p>- A &euro;5m Company Stabilisation Support for Gaeltacht Companies;</p><p>- The &ldquo;Stay and Spend&rdquo; tax credit initiative;</p><p>- A &euro;26m adaptation grant for the tourism sector;</p><p>- A &euro;10m grant for coach tourism;</p><p>- &euro;40m for the three main field sport bodies, GAA, IRFU and FAI;</p><p>- &euro;15m resilience fund for sport governing bodies and clubs;</p><p>The universal income supports of PUP and the wage subsidy scheme continue to be key to supporting to all sectors thorough this crisis, the extension of both of these schemes has provided some much needed certainty. </p><p>In addition, as part of Budget 2021 I have put in place a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the sectors through 2021.  I have also worked with colleagues across Government to introduce measures to enhance the competitiveness of sectors under my remit as well as ensuring access to the range of horizontal supports available. These include:</p><p>- A new &euro;55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses;</p><p>- VAT on the tourism and hospitality sectors has been reduced to 9%, and will improve competitiveness and viability of businesses</p><p>- hospitality, accommodation and arts businesses impacted by pandemic can get rebates of up to &euro;5,000 a week under new COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)</p><p>- a new  &euro;50m programme of support for live entertainment </p><p>- a record &euro;130m in funding for the Arts Council for 2021</p><p>- over &euro;78m funding allocation for Gaeltacht and Irish language sector &ndash; up &euro;14.8m on initial 2020 allocation</p><p>- funding for TG4 up to &euro;40.733m</p><p>- Sport Ireland allocated &euro;104.5m &ndash; up &euro;36</p><p>I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the views and recommendations of these taskforces and consultative fora in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of COVID-19.</p></reply>

Following discussion at a recent meeting of this Group, I have requested that Department provide an update report on how COVID-19 has impacted on participation in physical activity and sport at school level at the next meeting of the Group, tentatively earmarked for mid-December. </p>  <p>  The timescale and manner of recommencement of inter-school sport in the context of the current pandemic is a matter to be considered by Government in the context of the Living with COVID-19 Framework for Restrictive Measures, published in mid-September. This Framework sets out the approach that the Government intends to take in the management of the pandemic over the period to mid-2021. </p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation with high incidence of disease, widespread community transmission, and considerable numbers of hospitalisations and deaths, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of the disease and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. Unfortunately, this means minimising discretionary activities such as non-elite sporting competitions and matches which are not permitted to take place in Levels 3, 4 and 5 of the Framework. </p>  <p>  The current Level 5 restrictions will continue until 2 December. The suite of measures to be applied thereafter, including for the sport and education sectors, will be decided by Government on the basis of the prevailing public health situation and in the context of the Framework published in September.</p></reply>

In reviewing rent limits, the Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre. The new rent limits set in the Regulations reflected significant increases on previous limits, in the order of 60% in some areas.</p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988. </p><p>It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.</p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.</p><p>It is worth noting that not all households receiving HAP for the first time are reliant on the availability of properties on the private market. Many tenancies arise from referrals and other forms of communication. Some households receiving HAP for the first time transfer from Rent Supplement in an existing tenancy. Other households who were not in receipt of Rent Supplement and so are receiving financial support for the first time, can also enter the scheme in an existing tenancy.</p><p>Inter-authority movement is allowed under the Scheme to facilitate movement of HAP households from one local authority area to another in cases where a HAP tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area. Inter authority movement is, however, subject to certain conditions, such as the Social Housing Income Eligibility Bands and confirmation that the applicant's income is below the threshold in the new local authority. </p><p>Given that such flexibility facilitates better utilisation of all private rental stock for social housing purposes and supports the maximum activation potential of HAP households by removing geographical barriers to employment, all local authorities have been requested to give appropriate consideration to these requests. HAP tenants continue to be dealt with by their originating local authority. However, the rent and discretion limits will be those that apply in the local authority where the property is situated. </p><p>I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and it is a key mechanism in meeting housing need across the Country. However, it should be noted that, at the end of Q2 2020, an average of 301 additional tenancies are supported by HAP each week, with over 56,500 households having their housing needs met under the scheme at that point.</p></reply>

These studies have included the following; </p><p>- A commission to investigate sourcing a sustainable water supply,</p><p>- Site investigation work in order to facilitate the development of design proposals and  associated project estimates,</p><p>- An economic appraisal focusing on the Phase 2 proposal,</p><p>- A tourism and recreation study to assess the opportunity to develop water-sports and leisure facilities adjacent to the Ulster Canal Stores Visitor Centre in Clones. </p><p>Work relating to land requirements and purchase arrangements for this section of the restoration has also commenced.  </p><p>Discussions between the Departments concern the next phase of linking Clones to the Shannon Erne system and, in addition, to progress of the greenway components of the project from Clones, going east to Middletown, through Smithborough and Monaghan Town.</p></reply>

During the meeting, officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate the allegations, to ensure that any such persecution be ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya. </p>  <p>  In November 2018, Ireland, along with 15 other participating States of the OSCE, invoked the Moscow Mechanism to establish a mission of experts to investigate the reports. The report, published in December 2018, concluded that the evidence confirms the allegations of very serious human rights violations and abuses in the Chechen Republic. The invoking participating States, including Ireland, welcomed the report and its comprehensive list of specific recommendations that could be used by both Russia, including the Chechen Republic, and other participating States moving forward. We further urged Russia to heed the recommendations and work with relevant international institutions &ndash; including with the OSCE - to constructively address the issues raised.</p>  <p>  During my visit to Moscow in July 2019, where I met with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, I conveyed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at the targeting of LGBTI+ individuals in Chechnya, urging that Russia engage constructively with the Moscow Mechanism report and recommendations. In addition to diplomatic and political dialogue with the Russian Government, Ireland continues to prioritise direct engagement with Russian Civil Society through our Embassy in Moscow, and all official and political travel to Russia includes meetings with local organisations and human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  Ireland regularly makes recommendations on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity through the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council. In May 2018, as part of the UPR of the Russian Federation, Ireland recommended that Russia adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexual orientation, including measures to allow LGBTI+ persons to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, without fear of harassment.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to raise its concerns over the treatment of the LGBTI+ community in Russia, and especially in Chechnya, through international fora such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. On the occasion of the 2020 International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia &amp;amp; Biphobia, along with our EU partners at the OSCE, we criticised the ongoing persecution of the LGBTI+ community, and called on Russia to uphold its international commitments to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.</p></reply>

We have discussed the situation in Belarus at the Foreign Affairs Council each month since the fraudulent election and we have been firmly engaged in seeking a peaceful and democratic resolution to the crisis. </p>  <p>  In response to the falsification of the election result and the use of state violence against peaceful protesters the European Council agreed on the imposition of targeted sanctions against individuals in Belarus. So far 55 individuals have been sanctioned, including Lukashenko himself, and we stand ready to go further.</p>  <p>  However, sanctions are just one element of a broader response. We remain engaged in supporting the Belarusian people in their simple and clear demand to have free and fair elections and to have their basic human rights respected. The review of EU-Belarus relations will soon be finalised and we will continue to work on redirecting EU funds away from the Belarusian authorities and to the Belarusian people and civil society. </p>  <p>  We will continue to press the Belarusian authorities to end their campaign of violence against the Belarusian people, to unconditionally release those unjustly detained and to respect their international commitments.</p></reply>

We hope that this deal leads to renewed efforts to settle the long-standing territorial dispute. Crucial details of the implementation of the nine-point deal remain unclear, but my Department is closely monitoring the situation and analysing the consequences of the conflict and the agreement.  </p>  <p>  We remain deeply concerned for the humanitarian situation in the region, where hostilities have had a devastating impact on local civilian populations. The destruction of essential services during the conflict, including hospitals, and gas, water and electricity networks poses a serious risk to those in the region. Ensuring access for humanitarian organisations must be a top priority to avoid further catastrophe as we head into the winter months. Ireland and the EU will fully support efforts to help bring about a sustainable and lasting peace and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance. In that regard, we note the key role that the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will continue to play. </p>  <p>  The reported use of Cluster Munitions in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict by both sides is a contravention of International Humanitarian Law and as such should be independently investigated. Ireland has repeatedly called for all states to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions as a matter of urgency and to destroy all stockpiles of cluster munitions. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports a sustainable peace that is acceptable to all sides. As we know from our own history, this cannot be achieved overnight. It will require courage, compromise and confidence building on both sides with the support of the international community and this is the message we will continue to deliver in the EU and at the UN. </p></reply>

Today our presence has grown to twelve Embassies across the continent of Africa, including in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the Government launched &lsquo;Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Africa to 2025&rsquo; that sets out Ireland&rsquo;s plans to strengthen our political, economic, educational and cultural partnerships with African countries and institutions. As part of the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland Initiative and building on Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing engagement with Africa, this Strategy also frames an expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic presence on the continent. In particular, it commits to opening three new Embassies in French-speaking Africa by 2025. In line with this commitment a new Embassy will open in Rabat, Morocco in 2021, with two others to follow in francophone West Africa by 2025, building on our existing Mission network  in the region, in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with Ghana are currently managed through our Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria. In line with commitments made in the Global Ireland policy document, we are already strengthening our presence in Nigeria to enable a strengthened regional approach in West Africa, including Ghana.</p>  <p>  Ireland and Ghana share a long and positive relationship, based on a number of cultural connections, people-to-people and economic links. This shared relationship was initially founded on the tradition of Irish missionaries working in Ghana. Today, there continue to exist close links between Ireland and Ghana, including through a number of Irish businesses operating in the country. As well as positive bilateral relations, Ireland and Ghana also share a number of priorities at the international level, including on issues such as decolonisation, and a commitment to regional integration.  I look forward to continued and strengthened relations with Ghana as part of our commitment to step up our engagement in West Africa over the coming years.</p></reply>

Ireland remains a strong supporter of EU enlargement, viewing it as the most efficient foreign policy instrument the EU can deploy to anchor long-term stability and peace in the region. In meetings and phone-calls with my Western Balkan counterparts, I have communicated Ireland&rsquo;s steadfast support for their respective EU reform agendas and our willingness to assist in any way. This was also communicated by the former Minister of State for Europe, Helen McEntee T.D., in her visits to the Western Balkans in 2018 and 2019.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s focus remains on ensuring that the EU&rsquo;s involvement in the region is fit for purpose, in particular the operation of the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA), which aims to prepare candidate countries for EU membership. IPA benefits all the countries of the Western Balkans and Turkey, with funding for the upcoming budget period 2021-2027 in the region of EUR 14 billion. In addition, through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange instrument (TAIEX) of the European Commission, which facilitates the sharing of EU best practices, Irish experts have offered their expertise in a number of the Western Balkan countries in recent years.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also provided EUR 300,000 to the Regional co-operation Council (RCC) which focuses on boosting regional co-operation in the Western Balkans. The RCC is a regionally led framework for co-operation in south-east Europe, and serves as the operational arm of the South East European co-operation Process (SEECP) - a forum for diplomatic and political dialogue set up in the aftermath of the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Our contribution assists the RCC with their aim of promoting regional co-operation across social and economic initiatives, with a focus on employment, energy and transport.  Ireland also sits on the Board of the RCC.</p>  <p>  While our focus remains on the EU approach to the region, we are also working to strengthen our co-operation and bilateral relations with each of the accession countries, although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted these efforts.</p>  <p>  In Albania, we have made a number of efforts in recent years to boost co-operation. Ireland has hosted a number of study visits in recent years, designed to share our expertise with Albanian officials. This has attracted high level visitors, including the Deputy Minister of the Albanian Ministry of Finance and Economy in 2019, the Minister of State for the Diaspora in 2018, as well as separate delegations from the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. In addition, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), in conjunction with Sustainable Food Systems Ireland (SFSI), were selected to support a capacity building project in the areas of food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary standards in Albania. The project, which is funded by EuropeAID, is valued at EUR 5 million, will run until 2023, and be carried out in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, Evira ( the food safety Agency of Finland) and a local partner, Creative Business Solutions (an Albanian NGO). It is the largest tender won by SFSI to date. A study tour to Ireland by Albanian officials was a key factor in Ireland being selected as the lead partner for this project.</p>  <p>  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Embassy of Ireland in Ljubljana (which has responsibility for Bosnia and Herzegovina) collaborates regularly with the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably for the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the Museum in March 2020, an International James Joyce exhibition in September 2019, and the restoration of objects with Celtic connections for a preview in March 2019.  A number of cultural activities in BiH have also recently been supported by the Embassy. It should also be noted that Ireland actively participates in the UN peacekeeping Operation ALTHEA, the mandate for which was extended in recent weeks for another 12 months. </p>  <p>  Ireland enjoys warm relations with North Macedonia and was pleased to offer our strong support on its EU accession path, leading to the official decision by the European Council in March 2020 to formally commence accession negotiations. In recent years there have been some official visits between our countries, including the visit of then Minister of State  for EU Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D. to Skopje last year for discussions on the opening of EU accession negotiations and assistance Ireland might provide with respect to attracting FDI and diaspora engagement.  </p>  <p>  In Serbia, we have stepped up our efforts to boost engagement in recent years. In an effort to enhance Irish-Serbian collaboration in the digital sector, our Embassy in Athens hosted a Digital Creativity Conference in Belgrade in March 2019. The event received very positive feedback in relation to the potential for Irish companies in certain sectors of the Serbian market. One of the outcomes will be the establishment of a Serbian-Irish Business Association, led by Irish business interests in Serbia. On the cultural front, the annual Belgrade-Irish Festival which is supported by Culture Ireland and the Embassy in Athens (accredited to Serbia), celebrated its seventh year in 2019 and is a very positive vehicle for promoting modern Irish culture in Serbia. In recent years, Irish Aid has also provided funding for demining work in Serbia and developing demilitarisation capacity of the Serbian authorities. </p>  <p>  In regards to Turkey, the situation is more complex given that the accession progress is essentially frozen. Ireland provides funding to the Democratic Progress Institute (DPI), an NGO established with international experts in conflict resolution and democratic advancement. DPI initiatives in Turkey aim to promote democracy through strengthened public dialogue and engagement with civic society. Through this work, Ireland hopes to contribute to knowledge-sharing and learning opportunities for co-operation on democratic advancement across all sectors of Turkish society. Ireland has provided funding to the value of EUR 25,000 in 2020 for projects in Turkey run by the Journalists Association, the Federation of Women Associations of Turkey and the SADA Women&rsquo;s Cooperative. Our Embassy in Ankara cooperates on many local cultural initiatives, including support for Irish films at annual Turkish film festivals and &ldquo;greenings&rdquo; for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 2019 and 2020. In the field of education, the Embassy cooperates with Hacettepe University in Ankara to support the annual Literary One Day Conference on Irish writers. Ireland welcomes Turkish graduate students every year under the EU Jean Monnet Scholarship Programme on research topics directly related to Turkey&rsquo;s EU harmonisation process and the EU acquis.</p></reply>

Having previously served together on the UN Security Council in 2001-2002, Ireland and Norway will again serve together on the Council for the upcoming 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s approach at Council will be informed by our core principles of building peace, strengthening prevention, and ensuring accountability.  It is intended to work together with Norway to promote and defend human rights, to address the humanitarian aspects of conflict, and to bridge divisions at Council. The respective UN Security Council teams in Dublin and Oslo are in close contact.</p>  <p>  In terms of the economic relationship, Norway is an important market for Irish goods and services, with total trade worth &euro;3.6 billion in 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the final stages of completing the Nordic Strategy, which will provide a comprehensive framework for deepening our bilateral and multilateral engagement with the Nordic countries, including Norway, over the next five years.  We will work with the Nordic countries in international fora towards a safer, more just and sustainable future, and to underpin international peace and security and the rules-based international order.  The Strategy also envisages a deeper trading and research relationship with the region.</p></reply>

As Ireland's fifth largest merchandise trade partner, Switzerland is a significant trading partner for Ireland: total merchandise trade amounted to &euro;7.2bn in 2018 of which &euro;6.4bn were exports and &euro;700m imports. Switzerland is Ireland&rsquo;s ninth largest services trading partner: Irish services exports amounted to &euro;3.3bn in 2016 and imports to &euro;3.2bn. A protocol amending the convention for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital between Ireland and Switzerland entered into force last month.</p>  <p>  Switzerland is also a growing market for Irish tourism. Tourism figures to Ireland from Switzerland have been growing substantially in recent years, with an 8% increase in 2018 to 120,000 visitors per year. However, tourism figures for 2020 will undoubtedly be severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.   </p>  <p>  We share similar viewpoints on international relations, including the promotion of human rights, the rule of law, and the importance of development aid, all of which allow for strong co-operation in multilateral fora such as the United Nations. </p>  <p>  My Department held senior official consultations with Swiss officials in Dublin in October 2019, and we intend to hold another round of senior official consultations with Switzerland in the coming months. These are likely to be held virtually if COVID travel restrictions prevent an in-person meeting.</p>  <p>  On EU-Swiss relations, Ireland believes that the conclusion of the Institutional Framework Agreement (IFA) would help develop the full potential of the economic relationship between Switzerland and the EU, and to consolidate our links and deepen relations. Legal certainty and a level-playing field will benefit both EU and Swiss economic operators on the internal market, and the agreement will enable Switzerland to obtain further market access in new areas, such as electricity. Ireland supports the European Commission in its approach to the IFA and hopes that a swift conclusion can be reached.</p></reply>

CG Edinburgh is staffed by a Consul General, a Vice Consul General, and an additional supporting official from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Consulate also employs one local staff member to assist with the wide-ranging work of the Mission.</p>  <p>  This Consulate has a substantial remit, including political engagement with Scotland; facilitating local trade and investment with Ireland; cultural promotion and representation; and community engagement with the diaspora. The Consulate works closely with other members of Team Ireland in Scotland, including Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Culture Ireland, and other State Agencies. Given the number of Irish citizens and the size of the Irish community living, working, and studying in Scotland, the mission also handles considerable consular demands.</p>  <p>  Since the joint bilateral review of Ireland-Scotland relations commenced in late 2019, CG Edinburgh has also devoted significant efforts to progressing this initiative in collaboration with Scottish counterparts. The review, which will be published soon, has mapped the connections between Ireland and Scotland and aims to develop a focused plan of action for further collaboration over the next five years.</p>  <p>  The busy workload of this CG Edinburgh, furthering Ireland's interests throughout Scotland, contributes to realising Ireland's broader strategic objectives with regard to the UK.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the establishment of the British-Irish Council, an institution of the Good Friday Agreement, and the role that devolution has played in the UK since 1998, the Department has increased commensurately its support for the Consulate General in Edinburgh.  Additional resources have also been committed to the Embassy in London.  The reopening of Ireland's Consulate General in Cardiff last year further reflects a commitment to engage in all regions of the UK, as does the announcement on 16 November that planning for a new Consulate for the North of England, to be situated in Manchester, will now proceed.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government outlines the Government's ambitions for British-Irish relations in the coming years, and includes a specific commitment to deepen and intensify links with the devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland, as part of a broader strategy of renewed east-west engagement. The Department will ensure that the resourcing of the Embassy and Consulates in Great Britain remains under review in this context, and is at the level required to promote and protect our interests, and Irish citizens, as the vital Ireland-UK bilateral relationship enters a new post-Brexit phase.</p></reply>

The Irish Coast Guard fall under the remit of the Minister for Transport. From within the Defence Organisation, both the Naval Service and the Air Corps provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard setting out agreed roles and responsibilities in this regard. </p>  <p>  In terms of the Air Corps' existing role in the aviation aspect of SAR, services currently provided by the Air Corps to the Coast Guard on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis include; Search &amp;amp; Rescue, search support in a number of settings including the potential to act as on-scene air Co-ordinator if required; Island Medevacs when the IRCG are unable to respond; Maritime counter pollution patrolling &amp;amp; monitoring; and Maritime surveillance, among other taskings.  </p>  <p>  There is an ongoing project under the remit of the Department of Transport, to consider, develop and bring to fruition a new Marine Search and Rescue aviation contract for future service provision.  In this context a strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal was completed and brought to Government for information in July this year. This assessment included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the state assumed full responsibility for the service, through the Air Corps . This option was ruled out for a variety of reasons but notably the risks to the state and questions around potential affordability and deliverability. </p>  <p>  I agree with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal and I do not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for SAR services in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue domain.  However I would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service, given their historical role in this area. There are capacity issues in the Air Corps.  Capacity in terms of personnel, training, equipment, infrastructure etc would have to be built.  Furthermore, I am well aware of the challenges the Air Corps experienced in the past in providing this service and any exploration of them providing some element of the service would need to take into account their existing roles,  the current challenges in delivering those roles and the feasibility of building the additional capacity in a relatively short timeframe.   </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport, to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.</p></reply>

However, the restrictions imposed in the interests of public health as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic have had a significant impact on certain Defence Forces activities, leading to difficulties in conducting inductions and training, including for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). This has impacted on the intake of Reserve recruits in the latter half of the year. Nevertheless, 65 additional new RDF members have been inducted to date this year, with 59 inducted into the AR and 6 inducted into the NSR. </p>  <p>  Given the competing recruitment demands at present, Permanent Defence Force (PDF) recruitment is, and will remain a priority.  While the Government remains committed to on-going recruitment in the AR and NSR, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. </p>  <p>  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decision was made by the military authorities to reduce the amount of RDF training activities in order to comply with public health guidelines.   While training has been limited, as the Defence Forces continue to contribute to the Government&rsquo;s response to the current COVID 19 response, some members of the Reserve who have skills which are required in that response, have been engaged in authorised COVID 19 training activities in support of the PDF, on a voluntary basis, and where their personal circumstances allow. Their contribution at this time is greatly appreciated.</p></reply>

As with other members of society, former members of the Permanent Defence Force can experience difficulties. In such circumstances they have access to the wide range of supports available to all citizens.</p>  <p>  Retired personnel also have access to the strong support network provided by the recognised Veterans&rsquo; Associations. Officials from my Department and I hold regular meetings with three Veterans&rsquo; Associations, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (ONE) and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO).  I most recently met with them last Friday, 13th November 2020 and discussed issues of concern to their members. </p>  <p>  As part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department has Service Level Agreements in place with ONE and IUNVA which set out the services the Department provides to these Associations.  Under the terms of these SLAs, my Department provides financial support by way of annual subventions of &euro;100,000 to ONE and &euro;11,000 to IUNVA respectively to support their work and the range of services they offer to ex-service personnel.</p>  <p>  ONE provides accommodation (board and lodgings) for 49 homeless, elderly and disabled ex-service personnel in three residential homes in Dublin, Letterkenny and Athlone, while IUNVA accommodates 4 retired personnel in its home on The Curragh.   </p>  <p>  ONE currently has 12 Veterans Support Centres (VSCs) nationwide, while IUNVA operates drop-in centres at 8 of its 22 posts around the country. My Department has assisted ONE in its plans to establish a network of VSCs nationwide. ONE plans to establish a total of 15 VSCs.  The VSC aims to prevent homelessness through early intervention and to actively address loneliness. VSCs are available to all veterans to seek support and advice, not just to ONE members.  </p>  <p>  Departmental properties have been made available to ONE and IUNVA to house their VSCs and drop-in centres.  9 of ONE's VSCs are located in military barracks, as are 3 of IUNVA's drop-in centres. Refurbishment work has been undertaken on a number of these properties to facilitate their use by the organisations. 11 of the 15 VSCs which ONE are in the process of establishing will be based in Defence Forces barracks.</p>  <p>  As a further means of assisting the recognised Veterans Associations, my Department secured total funding of &euro;300,000 awarded under the Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2020 to assist ONE and IUNVA with specific special projects. ONE has nominated the provision of a VSC in Cobh, Co. Cork as their special project. Work is currently underway refurbishing a former Social Welfare Office premises in Harbour Row, Cobh.  </p>  <p>  A component of IUNVA&rsquo;s nominated special project under the Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2020 is to increase the training facilities available to its members at nine of its posts around the country.</p></reply>

The current shortfall is especially marked in specialist areas, where small numbers are more vulnerable to gaps.   Without giving rise to any compromise on safety, the impact of these shortfalls has resulted in greater pressure on individual members and units. There has also been an impact on the operational availability of the Naval Service, and an impact on the overall number of operational ships, which is a situation that has to be managed carefully.  </p>  <p>  There has not been any approach by any EU authority or body in relation to our national Naval Service fleet's size or manning levels.  National defence and security are a Member State competency.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Naval Service's sea-fishery protection role, the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 established the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) as the competent Authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland within Ireland's EEZ.</p>  <p>  A Service Level Agreement is in place which underpins the relationship between the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Defence Organisation.  This Agreement provides for the development of an annual Control Plan and for agreed reporting and training arrangements. Via the annual Control Plan the Naval Service makes a commitment to carry out a certain number of dedicated joint sea fisheries protection days in conjunction with fellow EU Member States. On an annual basis, including this year in the face of a number of challenges, the Naval Service continues to meet its EU commitments under the Control Plan and to provide a high level of national fishery patrol days.</p></reply>

I am of the view that the new higher MERS, are the appropriate standards and will apply for entry to the Professional Masters of Education (PME) programme in September 2021.</p><p>As the original timing of the higher MERS may have caused difficulties for some students planning on undertaking a PME as an entry route to primary teaching, my Department made a decision in 2019 to defer the increased MERS for entry to the primary postgraduate route for an additional two years until September 2021. This deferral was to allow students the opportunity to make arrangements to ensure they have the necessary entry requirements for entry to the programme.I wish to note that the  new higher MERS announced in October 2017, continued to apply from September 2019 for students planning on entering the undergraduate Bachelor of Education (Primary) programme.</p><p>In the case of a student who does not meet the minimum entry requirement in Irish, English or Mathematics, it is open to the person to repeat the Leaving Certificate Examination or pursue a course of study leading to one of the alternative qualifications in the subject(s) concerned  as outlined in the published Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2020.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year, is not available on public scheduled services and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle. Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>Bus Eireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport as he is not attending his nearest post primary school.   The existing school transport service is currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available at present.  A refund of the school transport charge was processed on 8 September 2020.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in that area. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new school admission policies, which have been approved by the school patron and published on the school websites. </p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied, giving a priority to a certain catchment area is permitted as a criterion under the act, and schools can apply this as a criterion should they wish to do so.  The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. However in some cases there may be more applicants than places available. In such circumstances a selection process may be necessary and some applicants may not receive a place of their first choice.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the school planning area where they have sufficient places, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  The requirement on new schools established since 2011 to prioritise enrolment from a particular school planning area(s) does not apply to or impact on the majority of existing schools established prior to 2011.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:</p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school received an allocation less than that which they had on the date of issue of the Circular and existing SNAs in standard SNA posts at the time were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way.</p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.</p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care  needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It was expected that schools would review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here<i></i></p></reply>

Revised public health advice to reduce the capacity on school transport led to further additional costs of &euro;15 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  The range of supports being made available to schools includes  financial supports to provide for additional staffing, management supports, enhanced cleaning, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment costs under the Covid-19 response plans, school transport, the continuation of additional educational psychological services to provide for well-being supports, etc. </p>  <p>  The Government also approved a package of minor works grants amounting to &euro;75 million as part of the July Stimulus to support schools to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening. An additional &euro;105 million was subsequently announced for 2020 which will facilitate the bringing forward of an ICT grant and minor works grant for primary schools planned for 2021 and the delivery of projects and will also allow for an exceptional minor works grant payment to post-primary schools . </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that at the end of October 2020, &euro;154 million of the approved supports (&euro;72 million of capital grants, &euro;67 million current grants and pay costs of some &euro;15 million approx.) have been paid directly to all of the country's State funded primary and post-primary schools along with bringing forward the payment of &euro;30 million of primary minor works grants planned for later this year.  A detailed breakdown of this expenditure on a county by county basis is not readily available.</p></reply>

These hours have been in place since 2005 and form part of an SNA&rsquo;s contract of employment which was agreed with unions. This letter did not change the terms and conditions of SNAs or amend previous agreements.The letter was an important reminder to schools on the management, communication and recording of the 72 hours which are a part of the SNA contract.  It was an aide to ensure that schools effectively plan for the optimum use of this time to support the care needs of pupils. </p><p>Under the terms of the standard employment contract agreed in 2005, SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term, not exceeding 12 in total. </p><p>Under the Croke Park Agreement, it was agreed to convert the previous requirement of SNAs to be available for 12 days outside of the school year to one of 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs). It was agreed at that time that the 72 hours would be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year. These arrangements were notified to schools in 2011, in Department Circular 0071/2011.  </p><p>Both the original 2005 agreement and the Croke Park provisions were negotiated and agreed nationally between management and trade unions.  </p><p>No additional hours were required of SNAs under the 2011 agreement. </p><p>Some recent commentary has referred to the 72 hours as being &lsquo;unpaid&rsquo;.  However, remuneration for the 12 days or 72 hours is included as part of the normal salary paid to an SNA under the terms of the 2005 agreed contract. </p><p>As part of the 2011 agreement on reconfiguration, it was agreed that the scheduling of the hours is at the discretion of school management and schools were informed that they should ensure that accurate records are kept in relation to their use.</p><p>F&oacute;rsa, the trade union which represents SNAs, have formally sought abolition of the 72 hours contractual requirement through industrial relations channels. In addition, F&oacute;rsa have formally sought that the 72 hours are frozen and employers do not request their completion for the duration of the Covid pandemic.  </p><p>Some confusion had arisen at school level on foot of communications issued by F&oacute;rsa to schools stating that there is no liability to complete all or any of the hours.  As such schools and management bodies had asked the Department to clarify the position. During the course of discussions on the former claim, all parties were notified that the Department intended to issue a letter to school management bodies to remind schools of the provisions relating to the hours. </p><p>The agreed uses of the 72 hours include:</p><p>- SEN pupil-centred activity - such as assistance with care planning;</p><p>- Learning resource administration &ndash; such as preparing class rooms and materials;</p><p>- Class and school planning and development;</p><p>- Assistance with special exam centres for the State exams; and</p><p>- Training</p><p>The duties listed in Circular 71/2011 form part of the normal range of SNA duties, and are therefore liable to be performed at any time during normal working hours, including during the 72 hours.  </p><p>The 72 hours allow for very important support work such as assistance with care planning, learning resource administration and training to be carried out without reducing the SNA&rsquo;s time with the pupil in need of their care. Accordingly, the suspension of the requirement to complete the 72 hours would have a direct, negative impact on pupils with special educational needs as it would impede on normal class time. </p><p>F&oacute;rsa has previously claimed that SNAs are being asked to carry out duties inappropriate to the grade as part of the 72 hours. The Department&rsquo;s recent letter reminded schools of the agreed list of uses for the 72 hours under Circular 71/2011 and stated that the grievance procedures should be used where allegations of inappropriate use arise. Neither I nor my Department would support uses outside of those listed in the Circular. </p><p>However, I am aware that F&oacute;rsa has sought the abolition of the 72 hours requirement. They are pursuing that through the normal industrial relations channels and I do not intend to comment further on that claim at this juncture.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year, is not available on public scheduled services and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle. Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>Bus Eireann has confirmed that the children to whom the Deputy refers are not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their nearest post primary school. Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that payment for school transport for the 2020/2021 school year was received by the family in question on 10th September 2020 and as such is late.  The existing school transport service is currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available at present.  A refund of the school transport charge was processed on 28 October 2020.</p></reply>

I wish to advise the Senator that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under project Ireland 2040, including projects in Kildare, may be viewed on the Department's website,<i>www.education.ie</i>and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need, has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on the Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>and this information is also updated regularly. </p><p>My Department is aware that post-primary enrolments in the Kildare school planning area have been increasing in recent years and it is expected that this pattern will continue in the short to medium-term.  In that context, building projects at a number of post-primary schools in the Kildare and surrounding school planning areas which will provide additional capacity have been recently completed or are currently advancing.</p><p>Furthermore, it is intended that significant additional capacity to address this demand will be provided by the planned new 1000 pupil building for the existing Curragh post primary school.  This is intended to provide capacity to cater for demand arising in the Kildare school planning area as well as that in the Newbridge and Curragh SPAs.  There is capacity in the existing Curragh Post-Primary school building pending delivery of the new school building. </p><p>The site identification exercise for this school building project is currently at an advanced stage.  </p><p>Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department have been in contact with EU counterparts to confirm this pledge and to begin the process of resettling refugees to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Families arriving in Ireland will be firstly accommodated in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres, prior to resettlement in counties around the country, with access to all of the services provided to refugees arriving under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. Such services include those available to Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also committed to taking 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece, under the European Union Relief Projects (EURP). Unaccompanied minors arriving in Ireland will be transferred to the care of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  In June this year the first 8 unaccompanied minors arrived, delayed by the additional challenges presented for travel by the Covid 19 pandemic. I can report that the 8 teenage boys who arrived in June are settling in well and becoming acclimatised to life in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have moved to accelerate the arrival of the remaining children and have secured an additional sum in Budget 2021 to support this. I hope to be in a position to announce further information very soon. At present we await details of the family groups and unaccompanied minors and clarification regarding logistics for the interview missions required to transfer refugee families to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The state&rsquo;s capacity to bring unaccompanied children to Ireland is determined by the available care placements, and the commitments the state has made to unaccompanied children who are already here.</p>  <p>  Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children.

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which is part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes originates in Finland (and has been implemented in a number of other countries) and consists of a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the pack and these may include safety items, baby clothes and toys to support early development and books to foster a love of reading from infancy.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.</p>  <p>  Owing to COVID-19, work on the pilot project has been delayed. However, a Working Group will be established in the coming weeks to lead this development. An initial task of this Group will be to finalise the scope of this project and agree a detailed project plan. Key initial considerations will include the identification of the pilot geographic area, agreement on the optimal timing for (pre- or post- natal), and channel of, distribution of the baby box and the likely contents.  A researcher will be appointed to oversee focus groups and/or consultations with new and expectant parents to inform the identification of items for inclusion.</p>  <p>  Following this initial scoping phase, which should conclude by end Q1 2021, the Working Group will oversee a competitive procurement process to appoint suitable tenderers to a) develop and distribute the baby boxes and b) undertake a full evaluation of the pilot. Given the likely value of these contracts, the procurement process will take several months. It is therefore envisaged that distribution of the baby boxes will commence in end Q3 2021 / early Q4 2021.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-19a.729.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900075#WRM05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 278 together.</p><p>I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting students and families who are putting their children through further and higher education. </p><p>The main support available to students is the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. </p><p>Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915; the income threshold for this grant for the 2020/21 academic year is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p><p>Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2020/21 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents. </p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: <i>www.susi.ie</i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.  </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government commitment to address the gap in postgraduate grants and as part of Budget 2021, the postgraduate fee grant will increase to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition, the fee income threshold will increase to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500. These measures come into effect for the 2021/22 academic year.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p><p>The &euro;168m funding package also includes &euro;15m in IT equipment grants for disadvantaged students in further and higher education and a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. An additional &euro;3m has also been provided for investment in supports for mental health services and well-being initiatives. These supports are being distributed through the colleges and further education providers.</p><p>Also as announced as part of Budget 2021 we will provide financial assistance through a once off &euro;50 million fund for students to mitigate against the impacts of the changed learning environment. My officials and I are developing the process on how this once-off fund will operate for submission to Government prior to commencement. Further details will be available for students shortly.</p><p>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie</i></p></reply>

Under the Level 5 measures, higher and further education is designated as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and education activities cannot be held remotely. Given the scale and diversity within third-level provision, higher and further education institutions themselves are best equipped to determine in which circumstances onsite presence is required. In overall terms, the higher education sector has adjusted their provision to Level 5 restrictions and public health advice, with the majority of provision currently being offered online. Feedback from the sector has indicated a successful delivery of current activities during Level 5.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate that this may be disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, these measures are necessary if the spread of the Coronavirus is to be halted. </p>  <p>  It is the Department&rsquo;s objective, which is shared by the further and higher education sector, to ensure that, where possible, an optimal learning experience is provided in the circumstances that present at any specific time. In that context, it is planned to review the position with relevant institutions and stakeholders in the light of experience and the progress of the pandemic and communicate the position for next semester before the end of the year, acknowledging that there is a need for a balance between the provision of information to students so they can make timely decisions and maintaining responsiveness in response to the pandemic.</p></reply>

In order to facilitate this, a number of immediate, medium and longer term working groups were established, including the Mitigating Educational Disadvantage (MED) Group which was formed with the intention to scope out the main issues impacting on learning across all aspects of further and higher Education arising from the Covid-19 public health emergency.  </p>  <p>  A fund for student devices worth &euro;15 million was administered as part of a &euro;168 million package for further and higher education sectors. The &euro;8 million MED fund aims to provide funding to support educationally disadvantaged learners in accessing and participating in further education and training.</p>  <p>  In the further education and training sector, both of these funds are administered through the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs). The guidelines do not preclude any group applying provided all governance requirements of the ETB are met.</p>  <p>  Applications for funding can be made through ETB Community Education Facilitators and Directors of FET in ETBs.  ETBs have used social media platforms and other established mechanisms to ensure the call for funding reaches a wide variety of groups locally.</p></reply>

This process is set out in the International Protection Act 2015.  Under the Act, each application is assessed individually and takes into account both subjective elements (the applicant&rsquo;s own account or personal history) and objective elements (up-to-date information on the applicant&rsquo;s country or place of origin, including the laws relating to, and societal treatment, of individuals who identify as LGBTI).</p>  <p>  In relation to refugee status, there also must be a link between the persecution as alleged and one or more of the grounds set out in both the 2015 Act and the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, namely, being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>  <p>  An application for international protection cannot be made from outside the State. The person must present at the border or already be in the State when making their claim. </p>  <p>  Ireland follows the guidance of the UNHCR in relation to claims for international protection based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity and was one of the first countries to specifically bring sexual orientation within the ambit of a &lsquo;particular social group&rsquo; under the legislation that was in force prior to the 2015 Act. Training for International Protection Office (IPO) caseworkers and interviewers is very comprehensive and is conducted in conjunction with the UNHCR. The training includes a module in relation to interview techniques and how interviews are conducted.</p>  <p>  The IPO has incorporated the Difference, Stigma, Shame, Harm (DSSH) model into training for caseworkers. The model is designed to help the applicant provide a detailed narrative and to be a sensitive and appropriate way of assessing credibility in sexual orientation/gender identity (SOGI) claims. In addition, further written guidance on assessing SOGI claims has been provided to all staff and panel members.</p></reply>

The Act is currently under review and the Programme for Government commits to introducing, within 12 months, legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act. My Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. </p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation was conducted to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  I am pleased with the high level of engagement by the public with this important topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive consultation and in order to ensure that the final legislation will be effective, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and I expect to publish it very shortly. </p>  <p>  The purpose of this work is to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I would reassure the Deputy that all legislative proposals are developed and put forward bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution and our human rights obligations. </p>  <p>  The right to freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, which is provided for in the Irish Constitution and in both the European Convention on Human Rights and in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, like other rights in our constitution, it is not an absolute right, and can be limited or restricted by law but this can only happen where there are compelling reasons, including protecting other fundamental human rights. Any such limitation or restriction must be necessary, proportionate and explicitly provided for in law. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach taken to the reform of our legislation in this area - including through the research conducted and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will ensure that the legislation we develop plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future. This is the mission of my Department and as Minister I am fully committed to combatting racism and prejudice as a key part of this.</p></reply>

Significant demand from people seeking to renew their immigration registration accumulated during the four months that the Registration Office in Dublin was closed earlier this year. Unfortunately, due to current Covid-19 restrictions, the Registration Office in Dublin is now closed again for in-person appointments and I am conscious that this may place an extra burden on the registration system in the months ahead.</p><p>To assist in addressing this demand, the new online system for the renewal of registrations in the Dublin area, which launched in July, enables applicants to safely engage with the Registration Office without the need to attend in person at Burgh Quay. Substantial additional resources are also being provided  to the Registration Office to increase its capacity to handle current demand. The system is kept under continuous review and further measures to streamline the process for the benefit of our customers are currently under consideration.</p></reply>

The audit will be undertaken by an external consultant with meaningful involvement from relevant NGOs and service providers, as well as input from Departments and agencies. </p><p>The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and a procurement process to engage an independent person to undertake the audit has commenced with details available on my Department's website (<i>www.justice.ie</i>). It is intended that the audit will be completed within 3 months of commissioning and the findings of it will be presented to Government before the end of March 2021 in line with the commitment made. </p><p>The Deputies may also be aware that, over the last decade, work in this area has been conducted through successive DSGBV strategies. My Department coordinates the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully. The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. This is achieved through a Monitoring Committee composed of stakeholders from all sectors working together in partnership; as well as ongoing cooperation between the Department and frontline services and industry partners.  The Monitoring Committee and the NGOs represented on it are key partners for my Department in our work to tackle DSGBV and will be a primary focus of our consultations in the audit process. I can confirm for the Deputy that the organisation referred to is a member of the Monitoring Committee. </p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. </p><p>Without prejudice to the outcome of the audit, a review of the outstanding actions has been conducted to inform the forthcoming 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV, to be developed and agreed by Government before the end of 2021.</p><p>As part of the ensuring a national response to domestic violence, my Department in 2020 provided just over &euro;2 million in funding to support training and awareness initiatives in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and &euro;.19 million euro in funding to support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This year I have secured funding of over &euro;2 million for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and &euro;2.1 million to support victims of crime. In addition, I have secured &euro;2.3 million to implement Supporting a Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases which I published last month.</p><p>&lsquo;Supporting a Victims Journey&rsquo; will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has already started, and I expect this training will be rolled out in 2021.</p><p>The Deputies may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and expert assistance.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been preparing for Brexit for several years with a wide-ranging focus to determine operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, training and technology and continue to progress their contingency preparations. The Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising from Brexit.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been allocated an unprecedented budget of &euro;1.952 billion for 2021.  The significant level of funding provided over recent years is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As a result, there are now some 14,600 Garda members and over 3,000 Garda staff nationwide.  Budget 2021 will allow for the recruitment of up to<b></b>620 new Garda&iacute; and an extra 500 Garda staff<b>.</b>The Budget allocation also provides for an increase in supervisory ranks at Sergeant and Inspector level.  More Garda recruits and more Garda staff means extra members of the service on the frontline and in specialist units battling organised crime groups, supporting victims, and keeping people safe including in Border regions </p><p>In the event that Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can be provided through normal deployment. These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management and detailed consideration given in due course to the medium to long-term implications.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and police forces across the UK on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-border crime. </p><p>My Department has been examining these matters since before the Brexit referendum took place and extensive work has taken place to mitigate the effect of the UK withdrawal from the EU as much as possible.  Today, cooperation in the area of law enforcement, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, is at an all-time high - and measures are in place to ensure that we have a viable extradition system with the UK and that the continuing exchange of law enforcement data is maintained in a manner compatible with EU instruments on data protection.</p><p>The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services in both jurisdictions.</p></reply>

Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Act, and has engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission. The HSE advises that Dupilumab will be included on the agenda for the December HSE Drugs Group meeting at which the two applications and the submitted representations will be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  Dupilumab remains under consideration with the HSE and a final decision will be made in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

This Plan sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p>  <p>  The Plan sets out a framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, families, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. </p>  <p>  Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect what we know are our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our community.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided &euro;150m in new development money plus a further &euro;30m in Sl&aacute;intecare funding to implement a model of Enhanced Community Care. This funding will allow for the development of new pathways of care for primary health services and will enable delivery of enhanced care services across the country for those that need them.  </p>  <p>  Investment in primary care will underpin a move toward population-based delivery of services through Community Health Networks serving local populations of approximately 50,000 and will facilitate the development of specialist community teams catering to older persons and those with chronic disease, as well as the national expansion of Community Intervention Teams.  The rollout of the Enhanced Community Care model will build capacity through recruitment of more than 2,000 staff, with a particular focus on nursing and community therapists such as Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists and Speech and Language Therapists. </p>  <p>  Alongside this investment, the primary care sector will continue to utilise alternative modes of service delivery, including remote consultations using simple telephone services or more sophisticated online and video consultations.  The rollout of a network of Community Assessment Hubs and expanded GP access to diagnostics will also be important elements of the Covid-19 response and development of primary care.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also sees a significant investment into the health workforce with an increase of 16,000 permanent whole-time equivalents into the health workforce, above 2020 funded levels. Significant efforts will also be made to retain staff and to increase staffing levels across the health sector. This expansion is needed to continue to meet the demands of the pandemic and to ensure that our healthcare system is resourced to meet the healthcare needs of the nation. This expansion is not contingent or linked to the level of restrictions imposed in the country at any given time. </p>  <p>  You may also wish to note that further details in relation to the delivery of health and social care services in the context of Covid-19 can be found in Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19. </p></reply>

While there has been a reduction in service capacity due to essential physical distancing and infection prevention and control measures, cancer services have continued throughout the pandemic. This includes diagnostic services such as Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics , to which women can be referred by their GP if there is a suspicion of breast cancer. These clinics continued to operate and urgent cases were prioritised in line with the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme National Guidelines.  We have not received any reports in relation to problems with the availability of diagnostics for women attending Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics.</p>  <p>  In relation to breast screening services,  a phased reintroduction of BreastCheck commenced on 27 October.  BreastCheck invites participants to attend for an appointment at a scheduled time and they advise that they are not aware of any reports of delays in these assessments.  BreastCheck actively encourages women to let them know if they cannot make an appointment so it can be re-scheduled and/or the timeslot offered to someone else.   BreastCheck have also implemented a new text system to maximise appointment attendance and to improve communications with attendees.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

Service restrictions are predominantly due to social distancing requirements; waiting rooms can now only hold a fraction of patients compared to before the pandemic. Priority is being given to those with symptoms or requiring testing and treatment.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s CHO6 advise that the closure of the GMHS relates to the necessary redeployment of personnel to COVID-19 testing and contact tracing duties. Work is ongoing with other services, stakeholders and community groups in order to provide the best possible service to GMHS service users under the circumstances. Agreement has been reached with the GUIDE Clinic; all GMHS PrEP users will be facilitated in GUIDE for follow up appointments.  </p>  <p>  Phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as man2man,ie and sexual wellbeing.ie are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved PrEP services.</p>  <p>  At a national level, the HSE advise that staff recruitment is ongoing with regard to the dedicated provision of COVID-19 services. It is envisaged that this will enable staff from other health services, including GMHS, to return to their respective positions and resume service delivery in due course.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Student nurses and midwives who took part in this initiative received payment of the first point of the Health Care Assistant salary scale, &euro;28,493. The rate was also temporarily applied to those 4th year nurses and midwives on paid work placements.</p>  <p>  The regular pay for 4th year nurse students on internship increased by 2% on 1st October this year. The annualised salary for this group is now &euro;21,749 (or &euro;10.72 per hour) for general nursing and midwifery and &euro;22,229 (&euro;10.96 per hour) for psychiatric nursing.</p>  <p>  Post qualification and registration, graduate nurses can join the public health service as a Staff Nurse with a starting salary of &euro;30,609 (&euro;31,295 for psychiatric nursing) and after 1 year and 16 weeks experience may be eligible to apply for the role of Enhanced Practise Nurse with a starting salary of &euro;37,161. The recent Nursing Agreement also included measures that accelerate career progression, improvements to certain pay and allowances as well as pay adjustments for new entrants. These measures should help attracting and retaining nurses in the public health service. A nursing career in the public health service also offers other opportunities for career progression as well as other pay and non-pay benefits and I would encourage student nurses to take up these opportunities.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputy should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the Living with Covid Plan provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. </p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It should be noted that holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. </p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19.

The top level findings of those reviews were that e-cigarettes are not harmless but there is evidence that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes, that e-cigarettes are as effective as nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation and that there is a positive association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking in adolescents. </p>  <p>  These findings align with previous international assessments of e-cigarettes, particularly in their primary conclusion that more research is needed to understand longer term effects.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-19a.920.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111900078#WRP02700"><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department and has been published. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised a work programme which has been initiated and which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

It was agreed that both jurisdictions are committed to continue to exchange views in order to foster a commonality of approach in response to the pandemic and hope to provide a progress update at a future NSMC Health meeting. </p>  <p>  Practical implementation of the MoU has seen cooperation on contact tracing apps, critical care, and to discuss the recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mink in Denmark. </p>  <p>  The Cooperation and working together partnership between the Health Service Executive and the Southern and Western health and social care trusts, the health and social care board and the public health agency in Northern Ireland health continue to play a significant role in promoting cross border health and social care cooperation.

Up to &euro;6,220 is available under this scheme to cover the cost of establishment; in addition, the Department will pay premiums of up to &euro;680 each year for 15 years. </p>  <p>  When these forests are well-sited, designed and managed, they can deliver a range of &lsquo;ecosystem services&rsquo; such as the prevention of sediment and nutrient run-off, the protection of banks from erosion, &lsquo;food drop&rsquo; of insects and leaf litter into the aquatic ecosystem, the shading and cooling of water, the overall restoration of riparian habitats, and helping floodwater control. Ireland&rsquo;s approach to using forests to improve water quality is set out in the &ldquo;Forests &amp;amp; Water Achieving Objectives under Ireland&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan-2018-2021&rdquo;. Through combining tree planting with their other farming activities, farmers can actively create buffer zones to protect water streams from farm pollutants and riparian erosion.</p>  <p>  The optimum use of native woodland establishment to protect water quality is described in my Department&rsquo;s publication &lsquo;Woodland for Water: Creating new native woodlands to protect and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s waters&rsquo;. This document promotes the planting of Native woodland along side a permanent undisturbed water setback, 10-25 metres in width uncrossed by new drains &amp;amp; largely unplanted. Planting within the setback planting can comprise of single or small groups of trees of suitable native riparian species, strategically planted &amp;amp; maintained to deliver the ecosystem services described above.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the total area of native woodlands planted so far in 2020 is the highest on record and is equal to the annual target of 450ha set at the beginning of the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020. In terms of introducing new schemes to further promote native woodland planting and riparian planting in particular, this will be included in the public consultation process that will be carried out for the new Forest Strategy and accompanying Forestry Programme. </p></reply>

These key soil indicators can be used to assess and monitor different aspects of soil health over time. This research also investigated the interactions between soil type, climatic region and management and their effect on these key indicators of soil health. </p>  <p>  Overall, while the SQUARE project results indicate that the soil health status of Irish soils is relatively good, it identified that one of the main threats to soil health in Ireland was the risk of soil compaction.</p></reply>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took over responsibility for the Fishery Harbour Centres (FHCs) in October 2007. Ros an Mh&iacute;l is one of six Fishery Harbour Centres, the others are located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth and Killybegs. </p>  <p>  The FHCs were established to act as dedicated centres and focal points for the promotion and development of the Irish seafood industry which comes under the remit of this Department. </p>  <p>  Overall policies and strategies for delivering on climate change and renewable energies are not primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, these primarily fall under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. </p>  <p>  Should any proposals be brought forward either centrally or from private enterprises to develop the infrastructure in Ros an Mh&iacute;l or any of the Fishery Harbour Centres, to support the sustainable development of territorial waters, they will be considered as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Funding is made available on an annual basis by my Department to the FHCs, including Ros an Mh&iacute;l, via the Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. A phased programme for the infrastructural development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been progressed over the last number of years, which has seen a significant investment. In total, approx &euro;31m has been invested in capital developments at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC between 2000 and 2019. In addition, in excess of &euro;1.5m has been allocated for capital works in the harbour in 2020.</p>  <p>  The possibility of a deep-water berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been mooted for some time. The Department commissioned DKM consultants to conduct a Cost Benefit Analysis into the development of a deep water quay at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC and a draft report was submitted to the Department in June 2017. While positive, the Department had reservations with the report and never formally accepted it. Since the report was drafted, there have been changes to some of the fundamentals underpinning the original analysis. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the Department subsequently commissioned engineering consultants to undertake a review of the design solutions, scoping options and operational aspects of a possible future project. An interim draft of the Quay Wall Peer Review Report was received in April 2019. This report identified the need for additional site investigations to be carried out in Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC. These site investigation works were carried out in August/September 2019 and have now been completed. </p>  <p>The final Quay Wall Peer Review report was received on 27th July 2020 and a further update was issued on the 4th   September 2020. The Department is now considering this report in full, including the site investigation results, to inform a future assessment of possible design solutions and scoping options, which will, in themselves, inform any future decisions on progressing this project.  </p>  <p>  As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres generally, any future decision with regard to formally initiating this project in Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC, will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels.</p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy.  </p>  <p>  On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p>  <p>  The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p>  <p>  The High Court&rsquo;s ruling of Judicial Review proceedings which relate to the Policy Directive has been appealed by the State to the Court of Appeal and a stay is being sought on the orders granted therein.</p>  <p>  As this matter is sub judice, I am not in a position to comment on the policy until the matter can be resolved before the Courts.</p></reply>

We are committed to addressing the situation and  have taken steps to  improve matters by  means of  additional resources, a systematic approach to processing files and the reform of the appeals system.</p>  <p>  I must note that the FAC is operationally independent of my Department and they schedule hearings and deal independently with all operational matters in relation to individual decisions and the conduct of hearings.</p>  <p>  Forestry Appeals Committee</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020, I have moved quickly to appoint new members to the FAC, which comprises internal and external members.  The appointment of three very experienced Deputies Chair means that with the existing Chair  and two additional ordinary members, the Committee has operated in four divisions since 9th November, 2020. </p>  <p>  The FAC hear both oral and non-oral hearing appeals.  All appeals hearings are being held  remotely due to Covid-19 restrictions and the hearings are conducted five days a week.  The Committee has 71 appeals scheduled for November I understand. </p>  <p>  The Agriculture Appeals Office, which also operates independently of my Department, provides Administrative support to the FAC and the Appeals Officers appointed to the Agriculture Appeals Office are also members of the FAC.  There are thirteen Appeals Officers in the Appeals Office, four of which are permanently assigned to FAC while the remaining Officers carry out Agriculture Appeal duties and are rotated onto FAC as necessary.  The Agriculture Appeals Office also has responsibility for providing administrative support to the FAC and this administrative support includes one Higher Executive Office, three Executive Officers and four Clerical officers.  In addition, three planners have been contracted to assist the FAC in preparing documentation for the committees.</p>  <p>  Forestry Licensing</p>  <p>  There are currently 147 staff working across my Department's three Forestry Divisions comprising a combination of forestry inspectors, ecologists, archaeologists and administrative staff.  There are 21 ecologists working on licensing files (16 fulltime equivalents), with sanction for an additional eight permanent ecologists.   </p>  <p>  My Department is recruiting 13 Forestry Inspectors, 10 of which will be working on licensing files.  Eight of the 10 have been cleared by the Public Appointments Service and are in the final stages of joining the Department.  These staff are coming on stream now. Four Temporary Forestry Inspectors have been recruited to assist with licensing and are on contract for another 9 months.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the backlog of files with the Ecology Unit, a project plan is now in place, which comprises the above-mentioned additional ecology and inspectorate resources; the continuous improvement of business processes; and, the establishment of a Project Management Unit to support monitoring, reporting and communicating with applicants, forestry companies and consultants.</p>  <p>  Forestry Licence Appeals Process</p>  <p>  When a decision on a forestry licence application issues, it is advertised on the gov.ie portal.  28 days is provided in which to bring an appeal, during this time, no forestry operations may commence.  It is up to the FAC to decide on the validity of the appeal; to schedule any hearing; and, to issue a decision on the appeal.  The FAC has set a fee of &euro;200 to bring an appeal.</p>  <p>  An appeal against a decision is notified to officials of my Department by the FAC and the licence is suspended.  Officials prepare the file documentation and forward it to the FAC.  They attend any hearing that is arranged and once the decision is notified, act accordingly, for example, to reinstate the licence.</p>  <p>The FAC has several options open to them in deciding an appeal.  They may affirm the licence decision; vary it, which is usually to add, remove or amend a condition; or cancel the licence decision.  Since the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act commenced on 7th   October, the FAC may also remit and set aside the licence decision, in which case the licence is returned to my Department for reassessment; or finally, they may substitute their own decision.  The FAC will advertise decisions on their own website and will notify the parties to the appeal.</p></reply>
