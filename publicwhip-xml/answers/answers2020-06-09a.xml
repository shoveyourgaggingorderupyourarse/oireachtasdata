There is no discernible cost to my Department's vote in administering the Cycle to Work scheme, as the bicycles and equipment are paid for by way of salary sacrifice by those acquiring the bicycles. There are minor costs in processing forms and in carrying the up-front costs until such time as those are offset by the gradual deductions from salary.  Neither of these is quantifiable. The only material cost of the scheme to the State is the tax relief inherent in the scheme.</p><p>The total amount sanctioned to date by way of bicycle purchases for staff of my Department is &euro;77,279.69 which is in turn recouped from staff by way of salary deductions.

This then brought them into the period when the UN suspended rotations in all UN missions due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The rotation of these personnel was further extended at mission level by a further three months.</p>  <p>  As the deployment of the personnel to a sub-Saharan African country had been extended beyond their initial six month deployment, there was a requirement to extract them as soon as possible to allow for a national medical assessment of the officers.</p>  <p>  The officers in question returned to Ireland on Sunday, 31 May by commercial means, and following a medical assessment, they are currently self-isolating at home for a two week period.  </p>  <p>  New entrants into the mission are currently precluded under UN and MONUSCO mission protocols. The UN has recently advised that transitional measures will apply from July to December 2020 which will include a partial resumption of UN rotations with rigorous quarantine requirements and periodic reviews built into the process. </p>  <p>  The full impact of Covid 19 on future rotations is currently being examined by my Department with the Defence Forces.  </p></reply>

While the rotation of troops to and from UNIFIL, which was to take place mid-May,  has been delayed as a result of the UN suspension,  Ireland has secured an exemption and approval for a rotation of the  full contingent in June, during the UN moratorium.   </p>  <p>  The UN has recently advised that transitional measures will apply in the following six month period, July to December 2020, which will include a partial resumption of rotations with rigorous quarantine requirements and periodic reviews built into the process. </p>  <p>  While the Defence Forces have advised that the duration of the next UNIFIL deployment will be shorter than the normal six months duration, the full impact of Covid 19 on future rotations continues to be examined by my Department with the Defence Forces.

The death of George Floyd was appalling and the circumstances surrounding his death were deeply upsetting and unsettling. </p>  <p>  I am also deeply concerned at the underlying issues of racial inequality that have given rise to protests in many cities across the United States and elsewhere. I join with all those who have raised their voices in recent weeks against racism in all its forms. Wherever such injustice occurs, voices must be heard. The right to peaceful assembly, freedom of expression, and a robust, independent media are fundamental values in any democratic society. </p>  <p>  I have also been disappointed by the violent scenes witnessed at some of the protests in the US. Violence is not the way to bring about fundamental change and is not the answer to the problems of communities suffering racial and other forms of inequality. Rather, it is through solidarity, inclusive economic development, and community and political-level leadership that genuine and lasting change can be brought about. </p>  <p>  Clearly, every State has the right, indeed the duty, to enforce its laws and police its communities. This duty must, however, be discharged in a proportionate and accountable manner, avoiding excessive use of force, in line with international obligations, and with respect for the human rights of all involved. </p>  <p>  I continue to call for a de-escalation of tensions in the US, and a deepening of engagement at the community and political level to address the underlying issues of racial inequality which have led to such widespread protest. </p>  <p>  The disturbing events over the past weeks in the US have also sharply brought into focus the need to look hard at our own societies, in Ireland and elsewhere. I welcome the debate it has opened up in Irish society. We must listen to those speaking out about their own experience of racism and exclusion, identify the challenges in our society, and tackle these scourges head-on, collectively and pro-actively. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the United States share strong ties of kinship and enjoy deep and friendly relations, as well as enduring economic, cultural and social connections. As part of our regular dialogue, I have raised these issues with the US Ambassador, Edward Crawford, both on a telephone call we had last week and at a meeting this week. I clearly set out our concerns about the circumstances surrounding the death of George Floyd and the underlying issues of racial inequality, as well as some of the policing responses to peaceful protest. We had a good exchange of views on these issues and undertook to stay in ongoing contact in the period ahead.</p></reply>

However, the matter was discussed at the informal EU Foreign Minister's meeting on 29 May, after which a statement was released on behalf of the EU by High Representative Borrell, which Ireland fully supports. This statement expresses our grave concern at the decision and its conformity with the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and the Hong Kong Basic Law. An earlier statement made on 22 May called for democratic debate, consultation of key stakeholders, and respect for protected rights and freedoms in Hong Kong when proceeding with the adoption of the proposed national security legislation. </p>  <p>  I will continue to follow developments in Hong Kong closely as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

In particular, plans were put in place to ensure that we continued to provide an emergency service for the issuance of passports in cases of serious illness or death abroad. The Passport Service also assisted those whose applications were regarded as urgent. While staff were on site during the pandemic, carrying out this necessary work, they also produced approximately 6,000 additional passports. The additional passports were adult passport renewal applications received online which required minimum staff intervention. </p>  <p>  Personnel from the Passport Office were also redeployed into other essential public service roles, such as Covid-19 contact tracing for the HSE and working with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to facilitate the processing of Covid-related benefits. </p>  <p>  The Passport Office has now started a phased return to full operation. This planning is in line with the wider Government plan to reopen in phases. The Passport Service resumed processing of non-essential online applications this week (in Phase 2 of the Government roadmap). The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand, and we believe that we are well-placed to ensure the online service will be meeting its usual turnaround times of approximately two weeks by phase 3 in July.</p>  <p>  The Passport Online service has won awards for its user-friendly process, including a NALA award for the use of plain English. If an applicant is not familiar with using a computer, a friend or relative with basic computer skills can help them to apply online &ndash; the process only takes ten minutes to complete. Passport Online can also facilitate social distancing, given that a renewal application for an adult does not require the signature of a witness. </p>  <p>  Passport Online expanded in 2019 to include first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Europe. Irish citizens, including children, can also renew their passports online 24/7, from anywhere in the world. </p></reply>

Each year Ireland makes an assessed contribution to the running costs of the body, through the Department of Health: in 2019 this amounted to &euro;1.45m, and in 2020 the assessed contribution was &euro;1.68 million. This is topped up with a voluntary contribution of &euro;1 million from Ireland&rsquo;s budget for international cooperation, Irish Aid, managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 is a global crisis, requiring a collective, coordinated, global response.

To date, Ireland has contributed &euro;6.8 million to the WHO appeal. Ireland&rsquo;s funding contributes to the evidence, guidance and advice produced by the WHO on COVID-19 which directly informs Ireland&rsquo;s domestic public health response to the pandemic, along with that of the Europe Centre for Disease Control and the European Union. Ireland also benefits from WHO&rsquo;s support to other countries as, if left uncontrolled in other regions, the virus will return to Europe.

The potential for COVID-19 to worsen an already grave situation is also of concern, as the pandemic may inhibit peacebuilding efforts and may lead to increased violence against human rights defenders.</p>  <p>  I have strongly and wholeheartedly condemned the use of any violence, threats or intimidation against those defending their rights and the rights and fundamental freedoms of others on numerous occasions. I once again call on the relevant authorities to fully investigate these crimes and to bring the perpetrators to justice. </p>  <p>  Colombia has made great progress in strengthening peace and stability in recent years, following signature of the peace agreement between the Colombian Government and the FARC-EP group in November 2016, ending over 50 years of armed conflict. It is clear, however, that significant challenges remain in a number of areas, including rural reform, the reintegration of former combatants, human rights and the strengthening of protections for human rights defenders and social leaders.</p>  <p>  I firmly believe that an improved human rights situation in the country is linked to the full implementation of the peace accords. Ireland is a longstanding and committed supporter of the peace process in Colombia, having contributed over &euro;14 million in funding since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on human rights, conflict prevention, peace-building and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. </p>  <p>  As well as financial support, Ireland has also provided ongoing support in the form of lesson-sharing based on our own experience of peacebuilding and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. We also participate in the EU&rsquo;s ongoing campaign to recognise and champion the work of human rights defenders in the country.</p>  <p>  I have reiterated Ireland's support for the peace process in recent engagements with the Colombian Government, including a meeting with then Minister for Foreign Affairs Carlos Holmes Trujillo during his visit to Dublin last year, and in my contacts with his successor, Minister Claudia Blum.  </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; has been engaging with civil society, EU and UN partners on the human rights situation in the country since it opened last year. We also regularly raise this issue and the status of the peace process in our exchanges with the Colombian Government. </p>  <p>  The Colombian Government continues to affirm its commitment to the full implementation of the peace agreement, and has expressed its appreciation for Ireland's support in this area, as well as the important role played by former T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process. </p>  <p>  Last year, Mr Gilmore led the 11th session of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, raising the high levels of attacks and murders of human rights defenders, and the need for collective protection measures.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia, as Ireland continues to support Colombia in its transition to a stable, peaceful, post-conflict society.</p></reply>

The relief, as set out in section 81C of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999,  is due to expire at the end of this year. </p>  <p>  There are a number of conditions that must be satisfied for the relief to apply. There must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months of each other. Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty is chargeable only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold. A reduced rate of 1% is charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value. If the sale takes place before the purchase, then relief will be given at the time of purchase. However, if the purchase takes place first, then stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place.</p>  <p>  An important condition for the relief is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase (or an exchange of farmland) was made for farm consolidation purposes. The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  Following the farm consolidation, a farmer must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming. Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out an ex-post evaluation of the Stamp Duty relief which will examine the case for any amendment or extension of the relief beyond its current expiry date. In this regard, my officials have been in contact with the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme, as well as with their colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Revenue in order to gather views and opinions which will help inform the evaluation of the relief.

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p><p>Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. As stated above, an exemption from benefit-in-kind applies in relation to the cycle to work scheme, provided the required conditions are met. However, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed individuals, such individuals cannot qualify for the scheme. </p><p>Further information on the cycle to work scheme can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available <font color="#0000FF">here</font>.</p><p>It is not possible to estimate the tax cost of extending the scheme to self-employed individuals. </p><p>The scheme operates on a self-administration basis, and relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of their particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.</p><p>Accordingly, there are no records available on the number of people availing of the scheme.  </p><p>Finally, the expansion of any scheme does of course create a cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere.

The aim of the facility will be to support investment and reforms essential to a lasting recovery, to improve the economic and social resilience of Member States and to support the green and digital transitions. Support under this facility is to be focussed where the crisis impact and resilience needs are greatest. The Commission propose that this facility will be firmly embedded in the European Semester and that Member States will draw up national recovery and resilience plans as part of their National Reform Programmes. It is proposed these plans will set out investment and reform priorities and the related investment packages to be financed under the facility with support to be disbursed depending on progress made and on the basis of pre-defined benchmarks.</p><p>The Commission proposes that the &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo; funding be channelled through EU Budget programmes, to be repaid back between 2028 and 2058 drawing on future EU Budget contributions from Member States or the Own Resources of the Union. </p><p>The Commission favours the introduction of new Own Resources to facilitate the repayment of the market finance raised and to help reduce the pressure on national budgets. They have indicated that they may propose additional new Own Resources (such as an extension of the Emissions Trading System based own resources to the maritime and aviation sectors, a carbon border adjustment mechanism, a single market levy and a digital tax) at a later stage of the 2021-2027 financial period. </p><p>Ireland has broadly welcomed publication of the Commission&rsquo;s Post 2020 MFF proposals coming on top of the three safety nets of up to &euro;540 billion already agreed by EU leaders to support citizens, businesses, and countries and the ECB measures to increase liquidity. </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s proposals are detailed and ambitious and are still being examined to assess the implications for Ireland&rsquo;s priorities at an overall and sectoral level, for Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to and receipts from the EU Budget, as well as for the domestic budget. </p><p>With regard to the Commission&rsquo;s stated intentions&rsquo; to bring forward tax proposals for new Own Resources, the Deputy will have noted that the Commission have expressed their support for the OECD process as the best forum in which to address issues arising in the field of international taxation.</p><p>Nevertheless, Commissioner Gentolini recently re-affirmed his intention to propose a new EU levy on digital services and a minimum corporate tax rate in 2021, if global negotiations fall short. While the Commission proposals for future new own resources echoes this ambition, such moves will require the agreement of all Member States. The economic context has changed dramatically in recent months and all countries are now considering what impact the current crisis may have on their overall tax systems, which may influence their views on international tax issues.</p><p>Much progress has been made in the current discussions at OECD, and technical work at the OECD is continuing. The intention is to find political agreement for work on addressing tax and digitalisation by the end of 2020 and we remain focused on that goal.</p><p>Heads of State and Governments are expected to discuss the Commission&rsquo;s MFF and &ldquo;Next Generation EU&rdquo; proposals at European Council on 19 June.

A series of proposals have been developed under two Pillars &ndash; Pillar One and Pillar Two.  </p>  <p>  The work under &lsquo;Pillar One&rsquo; focuses on the distribution of taxing rights in respect of highly digitalised activities and seeks to undertake a coherent review of the profit allocation and nexus rules used in the existing international tax framework.  The work under 'Pillar Two' is examining the possibility of agreeing global rules on minimum effective taxation for corporate profits. </p>  <p>  My consistent view is that a certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  The tax challenges that have arisen from the digitalisation of the economy are global in nature and thus require global solutions.  I believe it is important the OECD work is successful to provide certainty in the international tax framework into the future. </p>  <p>  Discussions continue to progress, albeit remotely, but there remains some way to go both in terms of reaching agreement at the OECD and subsequently in implementing whatever eventually emerges from the OECD discussion. The current crisis has impacted the OECD's planned timelines, with key meetings moved out from July to October 2020. The OECD&rsquo;s ambition to find political agreement before the end of 2020 remains in place although further technical and implementation work is likely to continue over a longer period. </p>  <p>  What is achievable at the OECD may be ultimately be affected by the current crisis as countries assess the cost of COVID-19 to their economies.  Ireland remains fully engaged in the talks at the OECD and will continue to contribute constructively to the work.</p></reply>

Any further extension of zero rating to cover supplies of medical equipment and/or personal protection equipment to dentists and shop owners and indeed other sectors and businesses would require a change in legislation at EU level; the VAT Directive would not permit a legislative measure for the application of the zero rate of VAT to such supplies and there are no grounds in the Commission Decision that would support the adoption of such a measure, even on a temporary basis. </p>  <p>   The Deputy will be aware that businesses such as shops which are registered for VAT and incur VAT in relation to goods which will be used for the purposes of the taxable business are entitled to reclaim the VAT incurred through their VAT return. </p></reply>

The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce. The sector to which Deputy Pringle refers is no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to the future of the TWSS, I have always been clear that this support cannot last forever, but I am satisfied that the scheme should remain until the end of August.  As the public health restrictions are eased in the coming weeks, I will expect to see a continued decline in reliance on the scheme throughout the summer as the economy continues to re-open and people are able to return to work. This economic recovery will be monitored and will inform a decision later in the summer on the need for further extension or tapering beyond August. Furthermore, I acknowledge that certain sectors will face particular challenges into the future as we gradually re-open our economy, and this is one of many factors that will inform future decisions. </p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT.  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that the supplier does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and has no VAT recovery entitlement on costs where such costs are used for the exempt supply of passenger transport.</p>  <p>  Ireland may continue to apply the VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport as governed by Article 371 of the VAT Directive; however, it cannot change the conditions under which the exemption was granted. In accordance with the Directive a reduced rate of VAT (Ireland currently has two reduced VAT rates 9% and 13.5%) could be introduced to the supply of passenger transport in place of the exemption that currently applies; this would give the transport operator deductibility in relation to VAT on their business inputs but would involve charging passengers VAT on their fares. Under the Directive it is not possible to apply the zero rate in Ireland to these services, as their supply was never zero rated in the past.  </p>  <p>  In the UK, where these services were previously zero rated, the zero rate of VAT continues to apply to the supply of passenger transport, except for a taxi service which is standard rated, and suppliers established in the UK have an entitlement to deductibility on the costs relating to the supply of these services where the place of supply is the UK.</p>  <p>  I would point out that there are reliefs from VAT available to passenger transport operators, whose businesses are established in this State, as follows:</p>  <p>  -  the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012 provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport; and </p>  <p>  -  provisions within Section 59 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, which allow a person established in this State to claim deductibility in respect of input costs incurred in relation to the transport of passengers outside this State.</p></reply>

However, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s objective of getting much needed assistance to employees during the period of the crisis, the subsidy payments are not taxable in real-time through the PAYE system. Instead, employees will be liable to tax and USC on the subsidy amount paid to them by way of review at the end of the year.</p>  <p>  It is not possible for Revenue to quantify the likely amount of tax to be received from employees arising from the TWSS payments at this point in the year. This will require assessment at year end of those who benefitted from the scheme, including their length of time on the scheme, the amounts of subsidy received, and any other income earned over the course of 2020.</p>  <p>  When an end of the year tax review takes place, it may be the case that an employee&rsquo;s unused tax credits will cover any further liability that arises. Where this is not the case, Revenue has informed me that it is normal practice to collect any tax and USC owing in manageable amounts by reducing an individual&rsquo;s tax credits for a future year(s) in order to minimise any potential financial hardship. Additionally, if an individual has any additional tax credits to claim, for example health expenses, this may also reduce any tax owing. </p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that it will adopt a fair and reasonable approach to the collection of any tax owed arising from the TWSS, having regard to the financial circumstances of the persons concerned. </p></reply>

As of 8 June 2020, over 59,000 employers have registered with Revenue for the TWSS, over 520,900 employees have received at least one payment under the scheme and the cumulative value of payments made to employers is &euro;1.43 billion.</p>  <p>  On 29 May, I announced an important change to the TWSS to deal with the issue of those returning from maternity or adoptive leave which was raised by various parties and interest groups.</p>  <p>  Officials had been looking at how it might be possible to address the issue in a way that ensures consistent treatment with other employees who were on the payroll in January and February, whose salaries were taken into account in determining TWSS payments for employers. </p>  <p>  Following Government approval, a change to the TWSS will be made as an exceptional measure to accommodate the salaries of those who have returned to work after a period of maternity or adoptive leave who consequentially were not on the payroll during the relevant period. </p>  <p>  The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process but in the interim, Revenue has agreed that this provision will be operational from 12 June and that the subsidy will be backdated, where applicable, to the later of either the date of recommencement of employment or 26 March 2020.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this change addresses the matter raised and ensures appropriate operation of the TWSS in recognition of the unique circumstances applying to those returning to work after a period of maternity or adoptive leave by allowing for commensurate treatment with other employees who were on the payroll on 29 February.  </p>  <p>  Further details of how the measure will operate have now been published by Revenue, and I would highlight that the manual process being adopted will require input from employers so I would encourage them to contact Revenue to allow for payments to be processed as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. A loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.  The Central Bank has also indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

I noted the vital work the credit union sector is carrying out, which builds on the government&rsquo;s call for solidarity and community spirit which is synonymous with credit unions. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my officials have had regular calls with the credit union representative bodies and with the Registry of Credit Unions in the Central Bank to review any emerging issues in the sector resulting from the pandemic, and to ensure smooth information flow between the sector and Government. The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is also meeting regularly.</p>  <p>  I recognise the key role that credit unions play in the delivery of financial services in local communities across Ireland, the need for which is heightened at this time. Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide access to credit to support the recovery from the current crisis.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the overall financial position of the sector, credit unions have come into this crisis with a strong reserves position, with a sector average reserve ratio of 16% as at 31 December 2019. This highlights that many individual credit union boards have chosen to prudently maintain additional reserves over the 10% regulatory minimum requirement. Credit unions have also maintained high levels of liquidity, with a sector average liquidity ratio of 39% as at 31 December 2019. Notwithstanding the strong financial position of the sector at December 2019, sustainability is a challenge for many credit unions.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking, the current business model of Irish credit unions is suffering from low growth rates in loan demand over recent years (outpaced by stronger savings growth). Surplus funds not lent out to members yield limited investment returns reflective of the current low interest rate environment. This has translated into low loan to asset ratios (sector average 28%), low return on assets (sector average 0.6%) and high cost income ratios (sector average 82%).</p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19, including reduced demand for new lending, has increased the challenges the sector is already facing. As a result it was agreed that the CUAC would report to me by 30 June on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, the role credit unions could play in the economic recovery and any relevant recommendations.</p>  <p>  You may also wish to note that I have committed to a review of the Stabilisation Levy prior to introduction of the levies for 2021. As part of this review process the views of the credit union representative bodies will be sought and will help inform any decision I make. You may also be aware that a review of the Resolution Levy was completed in 2019, following which I made the decision to reduce the Resolution Fund levy for 2020, and that it is 44% lower than 2019. I will consider the Resolution Levy for 2021 this autumn.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank also recognises the challenges being faced by many credit unions to continue providing services to members in light of COVID-19. The Central Bank has introduced some temporary flexibility for credit unions &ndash; alongside similar measures for other regulated sectors - in the areas of reporting deadlines and is taking a pragmatic approach to Fitness and Probity requirements where particular roles in a credit union may need to be filled on a temporary basis, as a result of COVID-19.  The Central Bank has formally responded in writing to regulatory requests made by the representative bodies.   </p></reply>

The Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance the loans to Member States at the same interest rate, allowing Member States benefit from the EU&rsquo;s strong credit rating and low borrowing costs. The loans are targeted to assist Member States to address sudden increases in public expenditure caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to preserve employment (such as short-time work schemes and other similar measures put in place for the self-employed) and certain health expenditure.  </p><p>SURE would come with safeguards to ensure fair and equitable access to funding for Member States, with no more than &euro;60 billion available to any three Member States, under the proposal.</p><p>The loans will be underpinned by a system of voluntary guarantees from Member States. For a lending volume of &euro;100 billion under the SURE instrument, &euro;25 billion in guarantee commitments are required from all Member States collectively. This guarantee mechanism ensures Member States do not have to pay any money upfront.  The instrument would not become available until all Member States sign up to their guarantee amount, and these commitments would remain in place for the full term of the loans which they are underwriting. </p><p>Each Member State contributes to the guarantee in proportion to its relative share in the total Gross National Income of the Union. For Ireland, this would be equivalent to &euro;483 million (1.9% of EU-27 GNI).</p><p>SURE was adopted by ECOFIN Finance Ministers and published in the Official Journal on 19 May 2020. While the instrument is a regulation, which will have direct applicability in Irish law, signing the voluntary guarantee agreement, will require enabling legislation in Ireland.  This requirement stems from Article 11 of the Constitution which provides that all the revenues of the State &ldquo;<i>shall be appropriated for the purposes and in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities determined and imposed by law</i>&rdquo;. As no Member State can access SURE funding until all Member States have signed the voluntary guarantee, the timeline for introduction of legislation is urgent. The Government have decided to commence drafting legislation on this matter with a view to publishing a Bill as soon as possible.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-09a.194.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060900007#WRE01900"><p>Payments made under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) Scheme are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages and payments made under the PUP scheme are subject to income tax.  However, tax will not be collected in real-time while the scheme is in operation. This is in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s intention to get much needed financial support into the hands of affected workers as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that, at this stage, it is not possible to quantify the likely amount of tax to be received from persons in receipt of the PUP.  This will require assessment at year end, to consider their length of time on the PUP Scheme, the amount of payments received, and any other income earned over the course of 2020.  The taxation position will follow the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, while liable to income tax, the payments will be exempt from PRSI and the Universal Social Charge.  This will be the case whether the recipient of the PUP is a former PAYE worker or a person who was previously self-employed. </p>  <p>  While not liable to tax in real time under the PAYE system, the liability to tax on payments under the PUP Scheme will instead normally be determined by way of review at the end of the tax year.  I am advised by Revenue that when an end of the year review takes place, it may be the case that an employee&rsquo;s unused tax credits will cover any further liability that may arise as a result of taxation of PUP payments.  Where this is not the case and should a tax liability arise, it is normal Revenue practice to collect any tax owing in manageable amounts by reducing an individual&rsquo;s tax credits for a future year or future years in order to minimise any hardship.  Additionally, if an individual has any additional tax credits to claim, for example health expenses, this will also reduce any tax that may be owing.  I have been assured by Revenue that they will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the PUP scheme.</p></reply>

As an individual&rsquo;s income increases, they move up through the various rates and bands and, as a result, while the levels of take home pay increase overall, the amount of tax paid also increases. It follows that those with a lower income as a result of benefitting from the TWSS or the PUP will have a lower income tax liability than might otherwise have been the case.  </p></reply>

Furthermore, officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. All the banks, Bank of Ireland included, have continued to evolve and expand the supports they have available and I would expect that this process will continue.</p>  <p>  Bank of Ireland has introduced a wide variety of solutions designed to help both personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis including mortgage breaks, cash flow supports for businesses and banking arrangements for customers who are cocooning/self-isolating. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that as Minister for Finance, I am precluded from intervening in how Bank of Ireland manages its day-to-day business and relationship with any of its customers.  Decisions in this regard are solely the responsibility of the board and management of the bank which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of the banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, officials in the Department have requested a comment from Bank of Ireland in relation to the manner in which it is managing its branch network during the current crisis and have received the following response:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Due to COVID-19 Bank of Ireland has made a number of operational changes to safeguard critical services during the pandemic, respond to a significant shift in how customers are banking, and support social distancing requirements.</p>  <p>  "To safeguard critical services we prioritised one hundred and sixty one of our larger branches nationwide, as well as our contact centres and online banking which have seen a surge in use over recent months. One hundred and one mainly smaller locations, which had seen a sharp drop in usage, were closed. Colleagues from these locations have been supporting our contact centres and online services manage high volumes of requests, as well as our larger branches where social distancing can be better maintained.</p>  <p>  "We&rsquo;re continuing to see shifts in customer behaviour towards online banking channels, and social distancing requirements remain in place. Our focus therefore remains on protecting the prioritised services across one hundred and sixty one branches, telephone and online banking, while keeping all developments under active review.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The trading losses may be used to offset trading profits in the preceding accounting period on a euro for euro basis and, where the losses relate to a trade the profits from which would be chargeable at the 12.5% tax rate, they may be used to offset non-trading profits chargeable at the 25% tax rate in a manner that ensures the loss has a maximum tax value of 12.5%. An individual carrying on a trade can, where the trade is discontinued, carry back trading losses incurred in the final year of trading against the person&rsquo;s trading profits in the three years preceding the final year. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, and as outlined in my written responses of 20 May 2020 (6682/20) and 27 May 2020 (8008/20), Revenue has worked with my Department to introduce a series of measures and supports to help businesses deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of debt collection and interest charges in relation to certain VAT and PAYE (employer) liabilities. The tax debt warehousing scheme, which is being administered by Revenue, is also a substantial cashflow support for businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of all options to support the cashflow of businesses remains ongoing and the Deputy&rsquo;s input in this regard is welcome.</p></reply>

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders, however the Deputy should note that I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim as this forms part of a contract between the insurer and the policyholder. However, as a general rule, I believe that insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  Insurers should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Deputy should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) or litigation. In this regard, I understand that there are a number of cases that have been referred to the FSPO or where litigation has been initiated.</p>  <p>  The above said however, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that</p>  <p>  (i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.  Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly. </p>  <p>  My view in relation to business interruption and insurance should there be any further outbreaks of COVID-19 later this year or next year remains as it is for the current outbreak, that is, if a policy has an infectious diseases clause which does not exclude COVID-19, then as a general rule I believe they should honour it. </p>  <p>  In relation to the actions of the UK&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), I understand that the FCA is taking a test case to the UK High Court on the issue of business interruption insurance to achieve clarity for all parties concerned.  In an update on their website on 1 June, the FCA stated that they have reviewed over 500 relevant policies from 40 insurers. They have identified a sample of 17 policy wordings that capture the majority of the key issues that could be in dispute.  They will take these policy wordings to court, with insurers given a chance to file defences. I understand that a full court hearing is scheduled for the second half of July.  Given that the FCA test case is still ongoing, it is still too early to say what the impact of any decision of the UK High Court would  have on the Irish operations of UK-based insurers in terms of business interruption insurance claims.  As I have stated already, it is not my role to adjudicate on such matters as Minister for Finance, and additionally it would be inappropriate for me to provide commentary on an ongoing court action, including one in another jurisdiction.  That said, I would hope that UK insurers operating here would apply any favourable  findings from a policyholder perspective,  to their Irish policyholders, where applicable.  My Department will be monitoring the test case and consulting with the Central Bank of Ireland on any potential implications it may have for Irish customers of these UK firms.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is important that other business interruption issues, such as the need for forbearance for businesses, are addressed also by UK-based insurers in the Irish market. My understanding is that they are aware of the forbearance arrangement I announced with Insurance Ireland in April, however a number of them have made the decision not to apply it for their own particular reasons.  It should be noted again that I have no influence over these companies in relation to their day-to-day commercial decisions, however I think their response to their Irish customers is unsatisfactory and I have asked my officials to contact a number of the companies to ask if they could reconsider their decision. My Department will keep me updated on any developments in this area.</p></reply>

Profits or gains from these activities that were not attributable to a relevant planning decision were taxed in the normal way. Section 31 of Finance Act 2014 repealed the 80% tax rate on these profits or gains with effect from 1 January 2015.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, based on information returned on Income Tax returns and Corporation Tax returns for the years 2010 to 2014, there is no record of any such profits or gains having been returned. However, it should be noted that the windfall gains provisions were introduced primarily to discourage overheating of the property market by way of speculative transactions involving rezoned land rather than as a revenue raising measure. </p></reply>

A repayment of contributions is only permitted in highly limited circumstances, for example due to ill-health, and as such, this would be subject to income tax. </p>  <p>  The policy rationale underpinning this is the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. However, on actual drawdown a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. In the event of any early encashment of a pension fund the tax relief received must be clawed back. It should also be noted that any refund of pension contributions is governed by the terms of the specific scheme or product.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all matters of policy, while they are kept under review on a continuous basis, I do not have any plan at this time to revise these pension arrangements.   </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that a very significant and comprehensive package of measures has already been put in place to assist those who have suffered a loss of income arising from the COVID-19 crisis. This includes the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and bank-related forbearance measures.</p></reply>

The public consultation phase is also due to be commenced by DPER shortly.   DPER will progress the formal confirmation process in the quickest possible timescale.</p></reply>

I understand based on the information available to me that students in university-owned accommodation will receive pro-rata refunds if they have vacated their accommodation.  I have indicated that I would wish to see this principle applied in the case of students who were residing in privately owned student accommodation however it is not within my remit to direct any accommodation provider to offer a refund.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  The national co-ordination group for tertiary education is meeting on a regular basis to consider key issues impacting the tertiary sector, including arrangements for re-opening institutions. These arrangements will be dependent on public health advice, and will be communicated to learners as soon as possible. Higher Education Institutions are autonomous, and therefore the exact arrangements for re-opening are a matter for each institution to decide.</p>  <p>  Rental agreements between students and accommodation providers are a private matter, and neither I nor my Department have any remit to issue instructions in relation to the private rental market.  </p></reply>

The only course currently recognised as an equivalent to the SOLAS Safe Pass course is the Construction Skills Register (CSR Northern Ireland) one day health and safety course.</p>  <p>  SOLAS has examined the potential for online delivery as a means of continuing national construction health and safety courses while adhering to public health measures. No immediate solution has been identified that is equitable with the existing Safe Pass course delivery model, in being accessible to all eligible workers, providing real time course participants supports (literacy and numeracy) and interpreter services, as well as ensuring assessment integrity. </p>  <p>  On 5th June, the Government sanctioned the inclusion of Safe Pass, Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) and Quarrying Skills Certification Scheme (QSCS) course delivery in Phase 2 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for reopening society and business, on condition that public health guidelines are adhered to by approved training organisations. </p>  <p>  This means that the onsite delivery of these courses can recommence with effect from 8th June 2020 in line with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation&rsquo;s Return to Work Safely Protocols, relevant HSE advice and as set out in the SOLAS&rsquo; Standard Operational Procedures (SOP). Anyone wishing to book a Safe Pass training course should contact their local Safe Pass training provider.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns.  </p>  <p>  The English language education working group for this sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectoral stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectoral representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit. The Department does not intend to mandate the inclusion of representatives of staff or teachers in this forum. While the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership of this working group.  To date, the group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the working group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p>  <p>  In respect of the safe re-opening of English language education providers, the timeline and arrangements for this will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1st, the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.  This protocol envisions close engagement between workers and their employers during the development and implementation of these new workplace measures.  The experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.  </p></reply>

This guidance issued to schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with special educational needs, to support those at risk of educational disadvantage and to support the wellbeing of students.  This guidance was developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders and there is ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors on all matters relating to Covid 19, which will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Schools adopted various ways to engage with their students in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at home, including by post, e-mails, communication apps, the school website, use of other digital communicative platforms, including live meetings. Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning. These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure and assist pupils/students in the making of transitions. </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures. </p>  <p>  In relation to learners currently in sixth class, it is important that pupils/students move on with their peers and continue to the next stage of their education.  The guidance that issued to primary schools on 28th May includes information on managing transitions including the move from primary to post-primary school.  It sets out how existing resources such as the Education Passport, NEPs Continuum of Support and the Home School Liaison Officers in DEIS schools can be utilised.  Communication between the primary and post primary schools and with the parents and children is of utmost importance in order to ensure progression is as seamless as possible.</p>  <p>  Transitions are being further considered by the Department as part of the return to school advice which will issue to primary and post-primary schools in the coming months.  This includes guidance in relation to the wellbeing of our students and school management and staff in order to support successful re-engagement with teaching and learning and will include a focus on transitions.</p>  <p>  Many schools hold graduation ceremonies for pupils leaving sixth class each year. While it will not be possible for schools to carry these out in the traditional format, some schools are marking the occasion remotely, by hosting virtual meetings for the pupils or prerecording videos that can be sent to them to celebrate their time in school. Certificates of achievement, photo stories, scrapbooks and other memorabilia can also form part of the celebration.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making. My department will continue to be guided by the most up to date information from the National Public Health Emergency Team.</p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools. </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that students can return to their schools in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>Further details of how and when schools will reopen and also as to whether some online teaching or remote aceess may continue next year, will be announced shortly.</p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at www.education.ie/en/covid-19/#14.  </p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-pupils-with-sen-primary.pdf. </p><p>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-students-with-sen-post-primary.pdf.</p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p>.  </p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at www.education.ie/covid19/wellbeing/. </p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Post-Primary-School-Policies/Policies/Guidance-Plan.html. </p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/continuity-of-schooling/continuity-of-schooling.html.</p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased almost threefold, from 548 to 1,618 for the 2019/2020 school year; with 1,353 of these catering for children with autism. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally, including Cork, to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places. I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved. </p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.</p><p>The NCSE has advised that they have experienced difficulties in securing special class or school placements in certain areas in Co Cork, but that they are continuing to work as a matter of urgency in accommodating students who require such placements.</p><p>The NCSE's Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: .</p><p>The local SENO remains available to offer further advice and assistance, and I would encourage the parents of the child referred to by the Deputy to continue to engage directly with them, as required.</p></reply>

It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the integrated professional induction framework for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.</p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 and the unprecedented situation of school closures, on May 22nd last the Teaching Council announced revised arrangements which provide additional flexibility to support newly qualified teachers (NQTs) engaging in Droichead in 2019/2020 to complete the process. These arrangements balance the core principles of the policy which is the school based supportive process coupled with engagement in additional professional learning activities.</p>  <p>  The Council has made a significant concession for NQTs who had not completed the full Droichead process within the minimum period of time by 12 March. This includes the recognition of all elements of Droichead which have been completed up to that date i.e. additional professional learning activities, observations, professional conversations, cluster meetings, Taisce (the professional learning portfolio) and days/hours taught. In normal circumstances this would not be the position. </p>  <p>  Droichead as a process is not simply about teaching time. From a professional standards point of view, it requires the agreement of the NQT and the Professional Support Team in the school that a quality induction process has occurred over the minimum period of time specified. </p>  <p>  I am, however, also aware of concerns raised regarding a smaller group of NQTs who had not met the minimum time requirement by 12 March. I understand the Teaching Council has just completed a review of their situation and will be communicating directly with those concerned this week.</p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:</p>  <p>  -  2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p>  <p>  -  Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  -  A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  -  The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p>  <p>  Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.  There is no proposal at present to allow reopening of the ELE sector in advance of any other element of the educational sector and it is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in phases 2 to 5 of the roadmap will be balanced and guided in the first instance by the public health advice at that time.  </p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans. Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other jurisdictions will also be relevant. </p>  <p>  During this current period of closure, it is my understanding that English language education providers have continued to provide services to their students via alternative arrangements including the delivery of classes online.   </p></reply>

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, officials from my Department have had engagement with the Trade Union in question and teacher representatives where they have outlined their concerns.  </p>  <p>  The working group for the English language education sector has been established with a remit to address the issues arising from the Covid-19 pandemic with a priority and focus placed in the first instance on issues affecting students as well as other issues arising e.g. how stakeholders can work together to promote the sector as international markets move into recovery. The working group is comprised of key sectoral stakeholders including officials from my Department, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Enterprise Ireland, as well as lead sectoral representative bodies of providers and learner advocates.</p>  <p>  In respect of the safe re-opening of English language education providers, the timeline and arrangements for this will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1st, the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans.  Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.  </p>  <p>  The coordination of the response of the wider education system to the Covid-19 outbreak is a substantial challenge. In this context, the Department has found the current structure of the working group to be effective in delivering on its remit and, while the Department remains open to views, there are no current plans to expand membership.  To date, the Group has facilitated an appropriate level of engagement with stakeholders alongside the ability to identify and help resolve issues as they arise.  The Department and the members of the Working Group will continue to engage with external parties, to seek to exchange information where relevant and address queries where possible.</p></reply>

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  167 new special classes were established nationally for 2019/20 school year. There are currently 55 classes for ASD in Co Wicklow, of which 11 are post primary.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing, </p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places. I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Education and Skills, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.</p>  <p>  The NCSE advise that they are not aware of any specific issues with special class provision in the Blessington area in Co Wicklow.

Any award or adjustment will take effect from the month in which the change occurred.<b></b>This provision may benefit some students whose income has fallen in 2020 due to Covid-19 issues.</p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. Students are advised to submit their renewal student grant application as soon as possible. The priority closing dates for the 2020/21 academic year are 11th June 2020 for renewal applicants and 9th July 2020 for new applicants. Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, www.susi.ie. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. </p><p>My Department is fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services.  </p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.  </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from students&rsquo; local Tax Offices or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased almost threefold, from 548 to 1,618 for the 2019/2020 school year. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>167 new special classes were established nationally for 2019/20 school year. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing, </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places. I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister for Education and Skills, I have power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. This legislation has been used to good effect in the recent past.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents/ guardians of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>The NCSE team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist parents/guardians to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at:  </p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at . </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>It should be noted that where a parent/guardian seeks to enrol a child in a school and that school refuses to enrol the child, the school is obliged to inform the parents/guardians of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p><p>I would encourage the family of the child in question to engage with their local SENO on the matter of a placement for their child in September 2021.</p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>Further details of how and when schools will reopen and also as to whether some online teaching may continue next year, will be announced shortly.</p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at   </p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p> </p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and rresources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p>  </p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at  </p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at  </p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.</p></reply>

This can include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p><p>Since the announcement that schools would close and the extension of that closure, my Department has provided guidance to schools and teachers in the education sector to ensure that they continue to work and to engage with their students to continue the delivery of education. A series of guidance notes to support schools to effectively support and engage with their students are published on my Department's website at: . Further guidance will continue to be compiled to address the various challenges that arise for schools in providing programmes of continued learning in the remote learning environment and to accommodate blended learning solutions if required. Various surveys and studies has conducted across the education system has informed the development of guidance.</p><p>Resources to support the transition to distant learning are being provided by the Department support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), at . Scoilnet the Department&rsquo;s educational portal has open access to a wide variety of resources and information developed by various services including: the PDST, Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the National Council for Special Education.

Scoilnet also provides open access to extensive educational resources including Worldbook Online, at www.scoilnet.ie</p><p>Schools have been asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or where digital approaches may not be appropriate and to consider this actively in their approaches to provision of remote learning. As part of reopening of society roadmap and the lifting of current restrictions, school and college buildings are now opened for access by teachers for the organisation and distribution of remote learning in line with public health advice and restrictions and essential work that cannot be done remotely with continued observance of public health guidelines.  </p><p>Officials in my Department have liaised with colleagues in the DCCAE to raise the issue of barriers to connectivity impacting access to remote learning.

This guidance focuses on how schools can effectively support and engage with their students and address challenges in providing programmes of continued learning in the current context. The series of guidance notes includes advice on supporting pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and children with special needs. Guidance for parents to support their children&rsquo;s learning has also issued. In a collaborative effort, the Department continues to work with management bodies and other partners to develop further support and advice which will be made available on an ongoing basis. The guidance documents are available here: </p><p>The need for at risk learners to have regular, ongoing schooling is particularly important. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, learners at risk of educational disadvantage need even more support at this time. The teachers of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage in both DEIS and non-DEIS schools have been particularly focussed on ensuring that they provide support to these students when schools have been closed. All schools and teachers, including teachers of students with special educational needs, have been asked to communicate regularly and engage with students to ensure that there is continuity in their learning. Schools have been asked to continue to plan lessons and, where possible, provide resources for students or online lessons where schools are equipped to do so. Schools have also been asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Many schools have introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning.</p><p>Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) emphasizes the promotion of school attendance, participation and retention for children and young people and is working with schools, families and other relevant services to achieve the best educational outcomes for children and young people. To date, the School Completion Programme (SCP) has ensured that school work, materials &amp;amp; resources, as well as games and activities have been delivered to those most directly impacted by the closure of schools, while continuing to maintain contact with target children, young people and families. TUSLA Education Support service has also arranged ongoing contact with students and families.</p><p>In addition to the above, my Department has taken a number of measures to date to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>They include:</p><p>- Guidance and resources developed by the National Council for Special Education on supporting children with special educational needs</p><p>- Continuation of the School meals programme, funded through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to provide food parcels to children who are at risk of food poverty</p><p>- Continued funding  of Home Tuition or, where this is not possible, flexibility to bank hours for use at a later time in the year</p><p>- Resources to support good mental health and wellbeing amongst students produced by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) </p><p>-  &euro;50m in ICT Grant funding has issued to all schools of which &euro;10m is to assist schools to support continuity of learning for all students, including provision of devices to students to facilitate them engaging with remote learning</p><p>On Wednesday 6 May 2020, I announced the early payment of the &euro;16million DEIS grant for the 2020/21 school year.  The funding is being paid ahead of schedule to all schools in the DEIS programme to help support students who are most at risk of educational disadvantage during the Covid-19 school closures.</p><p>There are 890 schools with more than 180,000 students in the DEIS programme. The grants, normally paid in June and September, are worth &euro;12m to the 692 primary schools and &euro;4m to the 198 post-primary schools. Schools around the country are providing invaluable supports to young people in the most trying of circumstances. They will now be able to use this grant funding, if required, to support existing programmes to ensure continuity of learning, particularly for those most at risk. </p><p>In addition to the above I recently announced that a Summer Education Programme will take place for children with significant special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. Further engagement with the school sector will take place as proposals are finalised over the coming week.</p></reply>

Among a range of proposals, the document includes the concept of additional university places to help replace the projected significant drop in income across the sector along with a proposal for increased State support.  My Department has provided a detailed response to the document and a meeting with relevant officials has been arranged.</p>  <p>  As part of the collaborative response to this pandemic with key tertiary education stakeholders, the Department has established working groups composed of experts to assess and respond to the impacts of Covid 19 across the Sector.  These working groups members are reviewing immediate operations, medium term contingency planning and the review of specific and acute needs within Tertiary Education.  This process continues to facilitate the provision of key information from stakeholders, that will inform immediate and medium term actions to respond to the rapidly changing circumstances.</p>  <p>  Mitigating the impact for Higher Education Providers and safeguarding that capacity against the backdrop of the broader economic crisis is a priority.  By ensuring that core provision is maintained and in particular by assessing the level of financial vulnerability that may threaten the viability of any specific institution, the Department, the HEA and representative bodies can work together to respond to this crisis.  </p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of the financial impact on the HE sector, significant work has been undertaken by the stakeholder group chaired by the Higher Education Authority in consultation with the IUA and other representative bodies to collect information on the increased costs and projected income losses advised by HEIs arising from the crisis, based on an agreed set of assumptions.  </p>  <p>  In order to mitigate the risk for the viability of individual institutions, my Department is now engaging closely with the HEA to provide specific and granular institutional-level detail essential to assess the risk of institutional failure as a means to safeguard future recovery for the sector as a whole.   The department has provided a template of required detail to the HEA for analysis, which is being prepared at present in consultation with higher education Providers.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore my Department has met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the potential impact of COVID on the Tertiary Education Sector and the issue has also  been highlighted at Government. The Higher Education sector is a key element of the economy&rsquo;s economic and social infrastructure which also has a crucial role in recovery in supporting economic and social recovery. </p>  <p>  The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy in the forthcoming period and also in light of the future Programme for Government priorities and commitments.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the projected impact of Covid19 on the financial position of the higher education system, it should also be noted that a significant programme of investment into higher education is continuing in 2020, amounting to additional public investment estimated at &euro;101.8m following on from additional public investment in 2019 of &euro;99.7m &ndash; a cumulative increase over the past two years in excess of &euro;200m. </p>  <p>  My Department is very aware of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services. </p>  <p>  My Department is also conscious of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education. </p>  <p>  The HEAR and DARE schemes are operated by the Irish Universities Association (IUA) and regulated by the higher education institutions. Each institution determines its own admissions policy in relation to the schemes, the number of places they reserve and the allocation of those places.  As such, my Department of Education and Skills has no role in the policy criteria of the scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage actively with all key stakeholders to ensure the innovation and sustainable operation of the tertiary education system is safeguarded in light of its importance for the recovery of the economy overall. </p></reply>

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open addtional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an addtional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p><p>Regarding the school named by the Deputy, I wish to confirm to the Deputy that a special education needs base is included in the permanent school building to be constructed for this school.</p></reply>

The welfare of students and that of their families is front and centre in all decision making. My Department has worked closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the In This Together campaign which aims to help everyone in Ireland to Stay Connected, Stay Active, and look after their Mental Wellbeing throughout the Covid-19 Emergency. The In This Together campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the InThis Together site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. </p>  <p>  The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of NEPS and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. </p>  <p>  During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams was  written by NEPS  and has been published by my Department.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers, students, parents. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties, and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  </p>  <p>  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.  </p>  <p>  My Department is developing a plan for supporting the wellbeing of school communities as part of the plan for reopening schools.  A key element of supporting wellbeing at this time is the need for schools to manage and support transitions, including those transitions that have been impacted by school closures.   Neps is developing guidance on transitions for all students including students with special and additional needs. </p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) including the following new schools to serve the area referred to by the Deputy:</p>  <p>  - a new 8-classroom primary school established in 2019 to serve the Leixlip school planning area;  </p>  <p>  - a new 8-classroom primary school established in 2019 to serve the Maynooth school planning area;</p>  <p>  - a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Naas school planning area; and</p>  <p>  - a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Kilcock school planning area to be located in Enfield. </p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. In addition, a new gaelchol&aacute;iste will be established in 2020 in Maynooth. </p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population. </p>  <p>   Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in Kildare, may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   In the case of all new schools, it is general practice to include a Special Education Needs Base (SEN Base) in the accommodation brief for new school buildings, unless local circumstances indicate that it will not be required.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p></reply>

A communication pathway for schools, parents and centre managers in relation to education issues has been put in place by IPAS. Tusla Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) are assisting children and families who may need support, liaising with schools and sourcing additional services/resources where necessary. With regard to Wi Fi, all accommodation centres, which are under contract to the Department of Justice and Equality, are contractually obliged to have Wi-Fi available to residents. An examination of the level of Wi Fi access in these centres is currently being carried out by the International Protection Procurement Service.  </p>  <p>  Since the announcement that schools would close, schools have been asked to put in place arrangements to continue the delivery of education to students. A Continuity of Learning Group has been established within my Department and a series of guidance documents have been developed for schools on how they can effectively support and engage with their students in providing programmes of continued learning and address challenges at this time. The guidance also includes advice on supporting pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and children with special needs. All schools and teachers have been asked to communicate regularly and engage with students to ensure that there is continuity in their learning and to continue to plan lessons and, where possible, provide resources for students or online lessons where schools are equipped to do so.</p>  <p>  Schools have also been asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Many schools have introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning.</p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;50m in ICT funding for schools has been announced. Along with the annual &euro;40m annual grant available to eligible schools to buy equipment for use by students and teachers in developing digital technology approaches to teaching and learning, a further &euro;10m in the form of top-up funding was made available to all primary and post-primary schools to assist schools further in the purchase of devices for students and teachers to support continuity of learning during the current school closures due to COVID-19. DEIS schools have been allocated an additional 10% relative to non-DEIS schools to support their students to engage with online learning and educational resources. </p>  <p>  Schools are being asked to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning during this period and to address situations where students are disadvantaged in their engagement with the schools remote teaching and learning due to lack of access to digital devices. The devices will remain the property of the schools and loaned to the student to assist them in their studies. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently published a guidance document for parents and guardians of children of school going age. This document has been translated into a number of languages so that it can be understood by residents who are residing in IPAS accommodation centres. A newsletter incorporating this guidance document has been issued to all accommodation centres and this includes communication pathways by which residents can communicate on education related issues.</p>  <p>   RTE has developed the RTE Home School Hub, which is an additional support for parents and primary school pupils. Pupils are able to watch, download and engage with curriculum-based content, project work, and fun activities to keep them entertained and learning. This broadcast is a supplement to the ongoing learning being provided by teachers. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with IPAS and TESS to ensure that children of school going age who are residing in accommodation centres under contract to the Department of Justice and Equality to accommodate international protection applicants are supported during the period of this pandemic.</p></reply>

The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment. She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave. Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility and any such amendment would likely require primary legislation. The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. These matters are currently being examined by Government. </p><p>As you will be aware, on 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.</p><p>The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but in the interim Revenue has agreed to provide a facility to accommodate such cases. Although expected to be implemented on the 12<sup>th</sup>June, Revenue launched a new process on Monday 8<sup>th</sup>June which allows employers to include employees returning to employment after a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave or were in receipt of Health and Safety Benefit, Parent&rsquo;s Benefit or Illness Benefit paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  Employers who wish to access the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on behalf of eligible employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short form available for download via <i>MyEnquiries</i>in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS). The relevant details that employers will need to provide to Revenue include current contractual gross pay, pay frequency, normal PRSI class, type of leave the returning employee availed of and the date of return to work.  Any retrospective subsidy payments due to impacted employees will be processed by Revenue in due course. This retrospection will apply from 26 March 2020, the date of return to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever is the latest</p><p>I am conscious of demands on parents at this time and hope that the additional measures to support working parents that I have introduced in recent years, including the new parent&rsquo;s leave scheme and an extension of parental leave, are helping to ease some of these demands. In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of the licensing system, which generally requires that an applicant obtains a certificate from the Circuit Court or the District Court prior to obtaining the licence from the Revenue Commissioners, is to ensure that the person concerned is a fit and proper person and competent to undertake the statutory responsibilities of a licensee. It is for this reason that the Garda&iacute; are a notice party to such applications. In order to ensure compliance with licensing law provisions, licensees must display a detailed knowledge of the applicable licensing rules, including restrictions applicable to sales and supply to underage persons, ensure appropriate training of staff and be in a position to maintain proper conduct on the premises. </p>  <p>  A further objective of the licensing system is to ensure that premises are suitable for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor and that they provide a safe and secure environment for both customers and staff. This requires knowledge of, and compliance with, the relevant statutory fire safety standards, as well as workplace health and safety rules. Compliance with these aspects are of particular importance for the health and welfare of staff where intoxicating liquor is consumed on the premises. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to bear in mind that licensees are liable to be prosecuted in the event of any infringements of licensing law. For example, under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 it is an offence for a licensee to permit drunkenness or disorderly conduct on the licensed premises. In a similar manner, improper sale or supply on intoxicating liquor to underage persons is an offence under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. Fines may be imposed in the event of convictions. Moreover, claims for damages may arise where, for whatever reason, detriment is suffered by a customer or other person on the premises.  </p>  <p>  In light of these important factors, I do not consider that the establishment of bars in local community centres and the authorisation of mobile outlets would be in the public interest at this time.  Further changes may be considered by the incoming Government.</p></reply>

These are not matters within my responsibility as Minister. </p>  <p>  In relation to medical certification requirements for Garda members, I am advised by the Garda authorities if an absence lasts for more than one tour of duty, the member is required to submit a short medical certificate (not exceeding one month) to local management.  I am further advised that HR require medical certificate if the absence exceeds 28 days or if the member has exceeded 92 days in 12 months and/or 183 days in 4 years (and is therefore pay affected). Failure to submit proper medical certification may result in disciplinary action and/or removal from the payroll.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that Garda Human Resources do not keep central records of difficulties relating to the submission of medical certificates &ndash; rather, I understand that if a case is brought to the attention of Human Resources by local management, these cases are dealt with on an individual basis.  As such the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available and the time required to compile it would be unduly onerous.</p>  <p>  In relation to the arrest of Garda staff since 1973 and the charges on which they have been arrested, I am informed by the Garda authorities while information relating to individual incidents is recorded on Pulse, the information requested is not readily available or easily collated.  I am informed that the effort required in order to compile this information would be unduly onerous and an unjustified use of limited Garda time and resources. As such, I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with this specific information.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of Garda staff who were reduced to zero pay whilst under investigation, I am informed by the Garda authorities that in recent years there was one case of a Garda staff member who was availing of sick leave while under investigation and, due to exceeding the paid sick leave limits, had their level of pay reduced to zero. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that between 2010 and 15 October 2019, a total of three Garda staff were suspended while under investigation. One person was suspended in 2010 and two were suspended in 2018. I am informed that there was no case in which a member of Garda staff was suspended without pay.</p>  <p>  With regard to the promotion of sworn members following or whilst the subject of a public interest inquiry, I am informed that the Competitions Office in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na runs competitions in accordance with the Code of Practice Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and HQ Directive 23/12 (Guidelines for Internal Appointments and Promotions). It is important to say that the fact of an investigation does not imply wrongdoing or guilt.  I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carries out a number of checks on candidates for matters such as sick leave, discipline and signing of the Code of Ethics. The successfulcandidates selected by the Interview Board are sent to the Garda Commissionerfor approval.</p></reply>

It plays a vital role in ensuring effective independent oversight of our prison system and I was pleased to see an increase in the budget by &euro;0.7m in Budget 2020, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.2 million this year.</p>  <p>  The Inspector is independent in the performance of her functions and it has been a matter for the Inspector of the day to decide how the functions of the Office should be performed, within allocated resources.  </p>  <p>  I understand it has for some time been intended that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons would move from Nenagh, Co Tipperary to the greater Dublin area where a large percentage of the overall prison population are located and the advertisement for the role of Inspector in late 2017 reflected that.  I understand that since 2018 the Office has been operating in two locations - in temporary office space in Dublin and the office in Nenagh - and that there are currently a very small number of staff in both of these locations.  </p>  <p>  While the office is small at present with a total of 5 staff, of whom 3 are in Dublin, there are plans to expand this cohort and recruitment is ongoing at present for roles at Inspector and Senior Inspector level. Work is also continuing to identify a permanent office in Dublin.</p></reply>

The purchase of bikes and safety equipment is subject to normal Revenue audit procedures.</p><p>The details requested are set out in the following table.</p><p><b>Cycle to Work Amounts by Year</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Request Year</th>       <th>No. of Applications</th>       <th>Initial Cost - repaid by employee</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>&euro;57,501.86</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>112</td>       <td>&euro;82,526.53</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>108</td>       <td>&euro;80,599.68</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>89</td>       <td>&euro;68,236.92</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>&euro;60,179.87</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>&euro;57,226.63</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>&euro;62,820.73</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>&euro;58,011.58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>&euro;51,048.41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>&euro;58,473.84</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>&euro;57,658.51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>&euro;22,566.95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>902</td>       <td>&euro;716,851.51</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-09a.638.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060900015#WRN01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 223, 247 and 254 together.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that we are taking the issues raised in relation to this emergency accommodation premises extremely seriously. The welfare of residents is, at all times, our key concern. </p>  <p>  Last week (4 June 2020), officials from the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department held a clinic via video call with residents of the centre. This was attended by 12 of the 19 residents currently residing at the centre.   The clinic was held off-site in the Miltown Malbay Community Centre and was facilitated by a volunteer from the Limerick and Clare Educational Training Board (LCETB).  Other than the residents and the facilitator, only the manager of the Community Centre and the caretaker were present onsite at the time.   </p>  <p>  Each resident attended their own clinic appointment in a separate room away from the facilitator and the manager of the Community Centre.  </p>  <p>  A small number of the residents who participated in the clinics stated that the food was not to their liking. The majority of residents who attended the clinic stated they were happy with the food and with the accommodation in general.</p>  <p>  Following the clinics, an unannounced visit was made to the accommodation the next day (5 June 2020) by a senior official from my Department.  During this visit, a number of issues raised in recent correspondence to my Office were investigated.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that no health and safety issues were identified during this visit during which all rooms were viewed.  </p>  <p>  Concerns had previously been raised with my Office around rodent activity on the premises and water leaking. I am advised that there was no evidence of any rodent activity or water leaking on the day my official visited. When questioned by my official on these matters, the owner confirmed that a resident had reported mice in his room in February. The owner engaged a pest control company who could not find any evidence of rodents. They subsequently monitored the room for three weeks and could not find any evidence of rodents.  Regarding the water, I am advised that the owner confirmed that an incident occurred some months ago where water was leaking from a bath/shower on the second floor into a bedroom on the first floor. It was reported to him by the residents in the room and he sought to engage a plumber. One of the residents said he was a plumber and asked if he could fix it. It was addressed within a few hours and no reoccurrence of the leaking has been reported since.</p>  <p>   My official identified no concerns about the quality or variety of food available during their visit.  Food is prepared onsite by a professional chef and all meat is Halal certified. Residents also have use of the kitchen for special occasions and regularly cook meals of their choice from food supplied by management.  Arrangements were also made during Ramadan recently for residents to use the kitchen at night.   </p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that IPAS officials previously visited the premises unannounced on 13 February last, on foot of concerns raised by a local support group.  During the course of this visit, they inspected all bedrooms and recreation rooms and the kitchen and dining facilities and they had lunch with the residents.  I am advised that my officials did not find any major issues to report and the residents they spoke to did not raise any issues about the standard of the centre. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) also carried out a visit to the premises in February as part of a programme of visits to a variety of centres over a two week period. No specific issues were brought to my Department's attention regarding the premises arising from their visit.</p>  <p>  Our intention is to accommodate all international protection applicants currently living in emergency accommodation in dedicated accommodation centres as soon as places become available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-09a.641.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020060900015#WRN01500"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy 2019-2021 was launched last year and includes a wide range of elements, including a working definition of hate crime and upskilling Garda&iacute; to understand the needs of diverse communities and respond to crimes perpetrated against them. It may also be noted that the Garda Code of Ethics also commits members to opposing and challenging any behaviour or language that demonstrates discrimination or disrespect, in particular with regard to minority groups. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that relevant actions taken under the Strategy to date include completion by the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) of the following: </p><p>- Organisation of the annual Consultation Day in December 2019, which involved representation from a wide spectrum of our diverse and minority communities.  The identification and removal of barriers to recruitment was among the issues included on the agenda and addressed.</p><p>- Organisation during 2020 of dialogue days, tailored to specific minority groups and including discussion of barriers to entry.  Dialogues have been organised to date with members of the travelling community and LGBT groups. Further dialogue days with other groups were planned but had to be postponed, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These will be rescheduled when circumstances allow. </p><p>- Establishment of a Diversity Forum.  The terms of reference of the Diversity Forum will include addressing the barriers to recruitment and retention as well as monitoring progress relating to strategic priority 3, outcome 5 of the Strategy. Representatives for the Forum have been identified but progress has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>More broadly, the Deputy will recall that In December 2018 the Government endorsed the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and the report is now being implemented in accordance with the targets and timelines set out in the 4-year plan &quot;A<i>Policing Service for the Future</i>&quot;.</p><p>Among the issues highlighted in the Commission's report was that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society and should therefore develop recruitment strategies to achieve a more diverse intake.  These recommendations echoed those of the Garda Inspectorate following their examination of entry routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>It is planned that these and other questions on recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be considered as part of review of entry routes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Work is currently underway on the drafting of Terms of Reference for a Working Group which will bring this review forward, once established.</p><p>Finally, I note that increasing numbers of persons born outside the State have in recent years joined An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. For example, across 2019 and 2020, a total of 67 persons born outside the state, with 19 different nationalities, attested and became members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Following this, persons who are successful in seeking readmission to IPAS accommodation centres will be re-accommodated as vacancies arise in centres nationwide. Whilst every effort will be made to return persons to their original accommodation centre following the required period of isolation, this will depend on the situation existing when the 14 days is completed.</p></reply>

A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p><p>The overall figures for PPE items which were dispatched to the various IPAS accommodation centres are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Category of PPE</th>       <th>Quantity </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hand Sanitiser</td>       <td>5,300 litres</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>FFP 2 Face Masks</td>       <td>150,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Surgical Masks</td>       <td>95,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Face Visors</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Body Suits</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gloves</td>       <td>350,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aprons</td>       <td>19,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assorted Hand Sanitiser Dispenser Bottles</td>       <td>3,700</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hand Sanitiser Wall Dispenser Units</td>       <td>335</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Defibrillator</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>These figures are approximate. Unfortunately, my Department is not currently in a position to extract the detail of what was dispatched to each location due to staffing resources and the fact that it would take a significant amount of time to collate the data. </p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has also put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.  </p><p>My Department and I will continue to work hard with local management, health agencies, and NGOs to provide every support possible to the residents and staff in our accommodation centres at this difficult time.</p></reply>

Service providers must also prepare menus that meet the reasonable dietary needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the accommodation centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated at the centre. </p>  <p>  Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. It is a contractual obligation for catered accommodation centres that a 28 day menu be provided and that residents are consulted on that 28 day menu. Residents can advise their centre manager of any dietary requirement that they have and this will be facilitated, where possible. Arrangements can also be made to cater for particular religious dietary needs, for example, Muslim residents observing Ramadan.</p>  <p>  Accommodation centres which have moved to the independent living model, where residents are provided with ingredients and household items and cook for themselves, must provide a wide range of products which are culturally appropriate and meet the dietary needs of residents. Approximately half of all residents now have access to independent living.  </p>  <p>  We have continued the roll-out of independent living with self-catering facilities to centres and regional tenders now mandate independent living for all new centres procured through that process.</p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by both staff from the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department and an independent inspector. Part of the inspection process deals directly with the provision of food services. Meals are assessed during inspection for quality, cultural appropriateness and variety of menu options. Any issues identified are notified to the contractor to be addressed immediately.</p>  <p>  In August 2019, Minister Flanagan and I published new National Standards for accommodation centres. These Standards were developed through an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards will come into force in January 2021, and they contain commitments in relation to food including access to a varied diet that respects residents' cultural, religious, dietary, nutritional and medical requirements.</p>  <p>  Any complaints in relation to dietary matters should be brought to the centre manager in the first instance. If the resident is not satisfied with the outcome, they can make a complaint directly to IPAS, which will be investigated by IPAS officials and acted on appropriately. If the matter is still not resolved to the resident's satisfaction, they can raise a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman for their investigation. </p></reply>

We have been assured by both the HSE and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. </p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website www.hpsc.ie. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p>  <p>  IPAS has a dedicated team in place to work with accommodation centre managers so that they can manage any situation that may arise and the team are in daily contact with centre managers. </p>  <p>  At the outset of the pandemic, a contingency plan was prepared for each Centre, including provision of some onsite self-isolation at each centre, a plan for a response to an outbreak, enhanced cleaning regime required, etc.   Building on these contingency plans, a Risk Assessment Framework for our centres has been developed with the HSE. This allows all centres to be assessed for risk and any additional supports or interventions required can then be appropriately targeted.  This is important for the medium to longer term and takes account of the range of accommodation types across the Direct Provision system, from own-door accommodation to communal settings. A similar framework is applied by the Mental Health Commission for its residential settings. Assessments for all centres have been completed and follow-up work on the findings is underway.</p>  <p>  The established procedure across all centres where a person is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p>  <p>  Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Cahersiveen and Tullamore.  </p>  <p>  We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p>  <p>  We have cocooned all residents aged 65 or older and those advised to my Department by the HSE as requiring cocooning on medical grounds.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the daily calls to centres, we are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website www.accommodationcentres.ie. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. </p>  <p>  In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p>  <p>  During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required.

There are now over 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.  Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and this information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Group is examining both the reception system for accommodating applicants and the system for processing applications, and is expected to make recommendations for changes in both areas. A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, has been circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Briefing Note includes a list of measures, identified so far, which would immediately improve the situation of those currently in Direct Provision, and on which officials of the Department have been asked to prepare proposals for the incoming Government.  The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September. </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I are happy that this Briefing Note signals far-reaching proposals and we were anxious to ensure that Dr. Day and her Group were free to make any recommendations they deemed appropriate based on an expert analysis. </p>  <p>  Last year we also established a high level Interdepartmental Group chaired by a senior official of my Department,  to ensure that all Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities. The Group is reviewing the management of services for applicants for international protection and considering the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system.  Its Report has been finalised and is ready to be submitted to a new Government. </p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision refers to the suite of State services and supports that are provided by a range of Government Departments and agencies to persons seeking international protection in the State.  It includes provision of medical cards, an exemption from prescription charges, access to education for children, a weekly payment, access to Exceptional Needs Payments, when required, and, of course, ensuring that all basic needs are met, like accommodation and food.  </p>  <p>  It is important note that significant efforts have been made to reform the system in recent years. Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has himself noted that the system has improved considerably compared to what it was five years ago.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements made to the system in recent years include access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; agreed National Standards for accommodation providers; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents (now available to more than half of all residents).</p>  <p>  The new National Standards contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.  As well as the aforementioned access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children,  they are also supported by the Child Protection Policies that we have put in place in the centres.  In addition, there is a Tusla official seconded to my Department to work with our International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS). This ensures that any child protection issues are swiftly followed up and that the process for referrals is as streamlined as possible.</p>  <p>  Currently, around 25% of residents (1,974 people) in the Direct Provision system have own door self-catered accommodation. While, at this time, all available accommodation of this type is fully utilised, families are prioritised when this type of accommodation becomes available.  </p>  <p>  It is to be noted that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in its report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application Process, published last December, found that there was no clear consensus from the Committee as to what alternatives could or ought to replace the current system. Their Report also acknowledged that any new system of reception and accommodation will need time to ensure the right system is put in place.   </p>  <p>  Finally, Minister Flanagan and I look forward to the completion of the work of Dr. Day&rsquo;s expert group and the implementation of major changes, should the incoming Government accept the proposals.</p></reply>

As such, there are certain steps that the International Protection Office (IPO) is required by law to follow in assessing every application. The IPO is constantly exploring all options that will lead to a more timely processing of such applications.  </p><p>The IPO currently has an existing caseload of approximately 5,700 cases (at end April 2020) having received almost 4,800 applications in 2019. Applications have been increasing year on year since the IPO&rsquo;s creation at the end of 2016, with applications up 30% approximately at the end of 2019 on the total received in 2018.  However, it is acknowledged that the impacts of COVID-19 on travel to Ireland since March 2020 will somewhat distort that upward trend. </p><p>Efforts to improve processing times have been impacted upon by the current COVID-19 pandemic which has reduced the output of cases considerably.  The IPO&rsquo;s main focus going forward is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.  </p><p>It is recognised that no single solution will achieve faster processing times but rather a targeted suite of measures, including additional staffing resources. Options that are being explored include greater automation of the process including ICT improvements, revision of key documentation and the use of remote interviewing. </p><p>Historically, the majority of international protection interviews were conducted at the IPO in Dublin with applicants travelling from their accommodation to Dublin for interview.  Early in 2019, the IPO commenced a pilot to conduct protection interviews in suitable locations. These locations were closer to applicant's accommodation and removed the challenge for applicants of having to travel sometimes considerable distances for interview.  This pilot was successful and in November 2019 the IPO moved to the next stage - interviews by video conference (VC). The first VC interviews took place in the south and, in early 2020, were also successfully trialled in the north west. The successful trials suggest that interview by VC may be suitable for many, though not all applicants.

Prior to this, the three strands were examined sequentially and this could lead to long delays in obtaining a final decision.</p><p>Upon the commencement of the 2015 Act, approximately 3,500 legacy cases were carried over to be dealt with under the new single application procedure (1,500 of these cases were from the former Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and 2,000 from the former Refugee Appeals Tribunal).  A further 500 cases transitioned in the months following commencement.  These cases would have been the longest in the system at the commencement of the Act.  </p><p>The International Protection Office (IPO) committed to scheduling these legacy cases for interview by the end of 2018 and for completion by the end of Q2 2019, where possible.</p><p>The IPO achieved the first part of this commitment in 2018 by scheduling all transition cases for interview, where it was possible to do so. The vast majority of the legacy cases have now been processed to completion in the IPO, and the focus is now on post commencement single procedure cases.  </p><p>Some legacy cases will continue to be dealt with.  These include transition applicants who had not co-operated up to this point but who are now re-engaging with the process and applicants who have come back into the process through Judicial Review.These cases are prioritised and scheduled for interview at the earliest possible opportunity and are processed accordingly.</p><p>I append a number of tables providing the details requested by the Deputy on the number of applications by asylum seekers or International Protection applicants, as they are now known,  who received a final decision on their cases by the Ministerial Decisions Unit  in each year since 2010 . <table>    <tr>       <th>Year of Decision</th>       <th>Total Decisions</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>3,705*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011</td>       <td>1,815*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012</td>       <td>1,021*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>965*</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>2,032</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>2,804</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>2,766</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>1,191</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>1,603</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>2,872</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>693</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>21,467</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* These figures were collated from the Department's AISIP database.

It should be noted that targeted enforcement measures have been introduced in a number of areas where quad bikes and scramblers were causing difficulties. For example, Garda&iacute; in areas like Finglas have had recent success in reducing the number of issues with scramblers through targeted enforcement, while youth community engagement groups in Limerick have had successes diverting young people away from using these vehicles in a dangerous manner in public places, and towards properly organised motorcross events. </p><p>As I have outlined in previous Parliamentary responses, a cross-agency group has been examining the misuse of scramblers. This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.</p><p>On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area.  </p><p>The cross-agency group most recently met in December 2019. The group agreed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport &ndash; which has primary responsibility for road traffic legislation &ndash; would explore the feasibility of developing new legislative provisions in road traffic legislation, which would seek to deliver the benefits sought by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without unintended consequences for existing law.  </p><p>Addressing the misuse of scramblers is a complex matter requiring a considered and multi-faceted approach directed at those in individual communities whose actions and behaviour impact negatively on those around them.  At the December meeting, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na agreed to explore further targeted enforcement measures; while also advising that they would have a visible presence in affected communities over the Christmas period &ndash; which traditionally comes with an increase in this form of behaviour.</p><p>It was also agreed that my Department would consider and develop actions in order to increase awareness of the dangers of these vehicles jointly with affected communities, community groups and other stakeholders, and explore how best to engage with young persons who are drawn to this behaviour. My Department is examining options in this area, with due regard to social distancing requirements. </p><p>More broadly, the Deputy may also wish to be aware that the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026 has recently been published for public consultation by my colleague, the Minister for State David Stanton.  An online questionnaire is available until the end of June to allow members of the public, including of course young people, to express their views.

We have been assured by both the HSE and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. </p>  <p>  All accommodation centres are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website www.hpsc.ie. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p>  <p>  The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p>  <p>  Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Cahersiveen and Tullamore.  </p>  <p>  We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.  </p>  <p>  We have cocooned all residents aged 65 or older and those advised to my Department by the HSE as requiring cocooning on medical grounds.   </p>  <p>  We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website www.accommodationcentres.ie. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. </p>  <p>  During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. </p>  <p>  Regarding internet access, I can inform the Deputy that all accommodation centres in my Department are contractually obliged to have Wi-Fi available to residents.  My officials have been undertaking a review of access across all centres in recent weeks in order to ensure that signal strength is adequate. Televisions are also provided in all bedrooms. This enables children to access educational programmes such as the RTE Home School Hub, which is an additional support for parents and primary school pupils.  Pupils are able to watch, download and engage with curriculum-based content, project work, and fun activities to keep them entertained and learning. This broadcast is a supplement to the ongoing learning being provided by teachers. </p>  <p>  Children who reside in Direct Provision accommodation centres are in the care of their parents and guardians. Similar to all other parents, they are responsible for ensuring that their children are engaging with education at this current time. The Department of Education and Skills (DES) and TUSLA Education Support Service (TESS) are supporting the schools and parents at this time. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS ) of my Department is liaising with these services to ensure that the most vulnerable children are identified and supported.  A communication pathway for schools, parents and centre managers in relation to education issues has been put in place. TESS Education Welfare Officers (EWOs) will identify children and families who may need assistance, liaising with schools and sourcing additional services/resources where necessary.  Children and their parents or guardians living in accommodation centres are also supported by a Tusla official and a Department of Education official seconded to my Department to work with IPAS. This ensures that any education or child support issues can be quickly followed up.</p>  <p>  My Department has developed a Strategic Framework for Engagement on Child and Family Issues in the context of school closures and social distancing requirements put in place during the COVID-19 crisis. The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) and Child and Family Welfare Team has developed this framework to support families living in our centres. In preparing the framework, outreach has taken place with key stakeholders including centre managers, TUSLA, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Rural and Community Development, the HSE, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, One Family and UNHCR. We will continue to work closely with these and other partners. The Framework encompasses three broad themes under which actions will be rolled out: child and family welfare, identifying education requirements, and the general provision of activities for children.</p>  <p>  I understand that existing supports for groups under-represented in higher level education and at risk groups in further education and training, will be maintained and re-oriented as part of the response to COVID-19 by the Department of Education and Skills. These groups include learners in Direct Provision settings. A working-group on mitigating educational disadvantage is consulting with stakeholders in the further and higher education sectors on how best to ensure continuity of learning for individuals most at risk of being impacted by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I hope this information provides the Deputy with some reassurance of the steps we are taking at this time to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of all residents and centre staff as a priority. </p></reply>

It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving arising from, for example, service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and updated work practices. </p><p>In general (and absent exceptional delaying events referred to below), it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process. Additional security checks can result in some applications taking longer than this average timescale. Such checks are fundamental to maintaining the legitimacy of the naturalisation process both nationally and internationally.</p><p>In addition, processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. Sometimes the input of several government agencies, both within and outside this jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. In other instances, issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken. </p><p>It should be noted that once an applicant has been approved, there are a number of further steps which must be completed before they can be scheduled for attendance at a citizenship ceremony, which can result in an additional delay.</p><p><b>Processing Times: Months from Date application received to Date of Decision 2016 -

Firstly, on foot of a challenge taken in the High Court last year by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to their absences from the State during the last year prior to the date of their application, significant delays were caused to processing, as the naturalisation consideration had to be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal.</p><p>While it was subsequently possible to organise a naturalisation ceremony for thousands of applicants, the restrictions attendant to the current COVID-19 pandemic have regrettably resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services.  As a result of these restrictions, theCitizenship Division of the Immigration Service, along with many other public and private sector organisations is experiencing significant disruption in delivering its core functions. Working within these restrictions, public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities.  As the Deputy may be aware, the next scheduled citizenship ceremony due to take place in the INEC in Killarney in July 2020 has unfortunately been postponed due to the current restrictions. I have instructed my officials to examine feasible mechanisms and processes whereby procedures such as citizenship ceremonies can take place while fully complying with the criteria outlined in the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the number of applications on hand at a given point in time is impacted by ceremony schedules.</p></reply>

The Group is examining both the reception system for accommodating applicants and the system for processing applications, and is expected to make recommendations for changes in both areas. A briefing paper on the work of the group, prepared by the Chairperson to inform programme for government talks, has been circulated to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Briefing Note includes a list of measures, identified so far, which would immediately improve the situation of those currently in Direct Provision, and on which officials of the Department have been asked to prepare proposals for the incoming Government.  The work of the group is advancing at pace and their report is expected by the end of September. </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan and I are happy that this Briefing Note signals far-reaching proposals and we were anxious to ensure that Dr. Day and her Group were free to make any recommendations they deemed appropriate based on an expert analysis. </p>  <p>  Last year we also established a high level Interdepartmental Group chaired by a senior official of my Department,  to ensure that all Departments are proactively delivering on their responsibilities. The Group is reviewing the management of services for applicants for international protection and considering the short-to-medium term options which could be implemented to improve the system.  Its Report has been finalised and is ready to be submitted to a new Government. </p>  <p>  The system of Direct Provision refers to the suite of State services and supports that are provided by a range of Government Departments and agencies to persons seeking international protection in the State.  It includes provision of medical cards, an exemption from prescription charges, access to education for children, a weekly payment, access to Exceptional Needs Payments, when required, and, of course, ensuring that all basic needs are met, like accommodation and food.  </p>  <p>  It is important note that significant efforts have been made to reform the system in recent years. Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, whose report in 2015 has been the basis for introducing improvements to the system, has himself noted that the system has improved considerably compared to what it was five years ago.</p>  <p>  Significant improvements made to the system in recent years include access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children; agreed National Standards for accommodation providers; the introduction of labour market access; and the continued roll-out of self-catering facilities for residents (now available to more than half of all residents).</p>  <p>  The new National Standards contain specific actions to improve the lives of children in accommodation centres.  As well as the aforementioned access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children,  they are also supported by the Child Protection Policies that we have put in place in the centres.  In addition, there is a Tusla official seconded to my Department to work with our International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS). This ensures that any child protection issues are swiftly followed up and that the process for referrals is as streamlined as possible.</p>  <p>  Currently, around 25% of residents (1,974 people) in the Direct Provision system have own door self-catered accommodation. While, at this time, all available accommodation of this type is fully utilised, families are prioritised when this type of accommodation becomes available.  </p>  <p>  It is to be noted that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in its report on Direct Provision and the International Protection Application Process, published last December, found that there was no clear consensus from the Committee as to what alternatives could or ought to replace the current system. Their Report also acknowledged that any new system of reception and accommodation will need time to ensure the right system is put in place.   </p>  <p>  Finally, Minister Flanagan and I look forward to the completion of the work of Dr. Day&rsquo;s expert group and the implementation of major changes, should the incoming Government accept the proposals.</p></reply>

Further work will be carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase.  Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.  </p><p>The Roadmap is a living document and Government has demonstrated great flexibility in its decision to accelerate the phases as set out in the original Roadmap.  </p><p>The input and advice of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with Phase 2 and to accelerate elements of the Roadmap. The Government also had regard to a paper which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an updated assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify, from an economic perspective, some priority issues for re-opening of economic activity under Phase 2. This paper, &ldquo;Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity - Update for Phase 2&rdquo;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at . </p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>June the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., signed SI No.206 of 2020, Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions)(COVID-19)(No. 2) Regulations.  These Regulations, which shall remain in operation until 29<sup>th</sup>June, provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions, including the reopening of retail outlets and extending the distance that may be travelled for specified purposes. The Regulations also provide for continued restrictions for some businesses or services and for offences, including in relation to events. Businesses should carefully review these Regulations.  Schedule 2 of SI No.206 of 2020 sets out which businesses or services are not permitted to reopen at this time.  Caravan parks are included in Schedule 2 other than insofar as they are providing:</p><p>(a) essential accommodation (including accommodation for homeless persons and persons in direct provision and persons who are unable to reside in their usual place of residence due to reasons related to the spread of Covid-19 or otherwise),</p><p>(b) accommodation for a person that is necessary for the purposes of his or her work or employment,</p><p>(c) accommodation for a person that is necessary to permit or enable him or her to attend a funeral,</p><p>(d) accommodation for a person that is necessary to permit or enable him or her to fulfil legal obligations,</p><p>(e) accommodation for a person that is necessary to permit or enable him or her to receive medical or dental treatment, or</p><p>(f) accommodation for a person that is necessary for vital family reasons.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is hoped that in three weeks&rsquo; time we will be able to move to a more advanced Phase 3, which would include the reopening of domestic tourism, and bring forward the opening of hotels, restaurants, bars that also operate as restaurants, hostels, caravan parks, galleries and museums to the 29<sup>th</sup>of June.

Upon the commencement of Phase 1 of the Roadmap for the Reopening of Society the Health and Safety Authority, along with its usual workload, began a national programme of inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. Between 18 May and close of business on 5th June the Health and Safety Authority has recorded 1276 inspections/investigations of which 1089 relate to the Protocol.   The 1276 inspections were completed across a range of industry sectors including construction which accounted for around half of the inspections. The HSA normally undertakes about 200 inspections per week as part of its workplace health and safety remit so this level of inspections represents a significant increase overall. </p>  <p>  The results from inspections are encouraging. Broadly speaking and based on an initial analysis of the specific COVID-19/Protocol inspections, compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol is high and employers are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach.</p>  <p>  In terms of staff numbers, the Health and Safety Authority has a total staff complement of 182 which is made up of staff in administration and inspector grades. Of the 109 inspectors currently in the Authority across all grades, 67 inspectors have been made available to inspect on foot of the Return to Work Safely Protocol. This number covers both existing field inspectors as well as others redeployed internally from their existing roles. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities. These resources will be drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the cohort of Environmental Health Officers and will result in an additional 500 inspectors checking compliance with the Protocol as part of their normal inspection programme.</p>  <p>  All of these groups of inspectors are fully committed to working with the Health and Safety Authority and I am confident that the approach being taken is a logical, and good, use of available existing resources to cover all business sectors.</p></reply>

The Commission&rsquo;s primary statutory functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services. As part of its functions in this area, WRC Inspectors carry out announced and unannounced inspections at employer premises. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the WRC that on-site visits will resume in tandem with the commencement of next phase of the Government Roadmap on 8 June and that the WRC has engaged with key stakeholders on the employer and employee representative sides in this regard.</p>  <p>  WRC Management has also been in direct discussions over the last 3 weeks with senior Health and Safety Authority (HSA) officials to offer assistance to the HSA in carrying out Covid-19 workplace inspections. In this regard the bodies are agreeing a  Memorandum of Understanding between them to ensure that this assistance is provided in an efficient and effective manner.</p>  <p>  To give effect to this operationally:</p>  <p>  - The WRC  Inspectorate has completed the safety training required in the Return to  Work Protocol in preparation for the recommencement of on-site visits and  the necessary PPE (similar to what is being used by the HSA) has been procured and</p>  <p>  - The related on-site HSA inspection procedures to carry out Covid-19 workplace  inspections have been circulated by the HSA in the last week in advance of the start of the on-site visits commencing week commencing  8 June 2020.</p>  <p>  While on-site inspection activity was suspended, WRC Inspections of employment law compliance continued to be undertaken and finalised remotely by way of desk top enquiries, interviews with employers and employees on the telephone and examination of company records (such as payroll and hours worked) following their secure upload to the WRC.</p>  <p>  To date this year, a total of 1,640 inspections have been finalised by the WRC inspectorate. Since March, the WRC Inspectors have completed over 900 inspections, with approx. &euro;640,000 in unpaid wages recovered and 66 cases approved for prosecution. They also have currently over 1,200 open inspections being progressed.</p></reply>

When the International Education Mark is introduced, EI has agreed to take on this responsibility for a defined part of the business.</p>  <p>  Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), through its Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services (ACELS) function, provides quality assurance for English language services in Ireland. ACELS manages and operates an Inspection/Recognition Scheme for ELT organisations and an Accreditation Scheme for English Language teacher training providers. </p>  <p>  On the Education in Ireland website &ndash; www.educationinireland.com, EI does not list English language schools, but provides a link to the ACELS website which is for information purposes only.</p>  <p>  EI has confirmed that they only list nationally accredited schools as per the Education in Ireland brand guidelines and if they were to introduce other links, the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills would need to approve this change to the brand criteria. EI does have a number of English Language Schools as client companies based on their size and international focus, all these companies are eligible for supports from EI.</p>  <p>  On the website of the Department of Justice and Equality, it is highlighted that a provider and courses are listed on the ILEP in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s student immigration policy, attendance at that college in respect of one of their listed full time courses on the ILEP is an eligible purpose for a non-EEA national coming to Ireland.  The Interim List includes information on education and training programmes which meet specified criteria. </p>  <p>  The Interim List is a reference point primarily for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of the Department of Justice and Equality, in considering visa and residency applications from non-EEA applicants wishing to study on a full-time basis in Ireland and to avail of a concession to take up casual employment in the State with certain restrictions. The Department of Education and Skills has an advisory role in identifying appropriate criteria for the inclusion of programmes in the Interim List. The Interim List is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality. </p>  <p>  In relation to EI promoting all Irish-based English language schools in a post-COVID-19 world, this is a matter to be considered as part of the review of the international education strategy 2016-2020 which is currently underway by the Department of Education and Skills. </p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme was to provide expert guidance and advice to SMEs employing up 50 people and enable business owners make informed decisions about what immediate measures and remedial actions could be taken at the outset of this crisis, to protect staff and sales and eventually help the business recover.</p>  <p>  The scheme was a resounding success in terms of uptake due to it being an appropriate response and support to recognised business needs for that point in time.  The Business Continuity Voucher provided up to &euro;2,500 in consultancy costs, to develop short and long-term strategies to respond to the initial pandemic and to plan for the eventual recovery and reopening of the economy. </p>  <p>  As the reopening of the economy proceeds, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase as we progress through the 5 stages of the Government Roadmap.  It is in this context that the Business Continuity Voucher is being phased out and is now closed to new applicants.  In recognition of this new stage the new &euro;250m Restart Grant was introduced to assist micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures.</p>  <p>  The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Voucher vouchers and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the Business Continuity Voucher scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.  The Local Enterprise Offices have thus far approved over 8,200 Business Continuity Vouchers with an overall value thus far of &euro;18.9m and had received over 14,000 applications prior to the closing date.  </p>  <p>  The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m employing up to 50 people, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% projected reduction in turnover to the end of June 2020. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, or a minimum grant of &euro;2,000, with a maximum grant of &euro;10,000.</p></reply>

This includes the key priority of ensuring the continued supply of medicines and medical devices post-Brexit. The Department of Health and its agencies have published comprehensive details about the work undertaken in relation to this issue, which can be found in Chapter 24 of the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update. </p>  <p>  My Department has examined a broad spectrum of Brexit-related issues affecting business in Ireland. The agencies of the Department are also contributing to our efforts to mitigate any potential disruption to supply chains. The agencies continue to deliver as well a broad range of Brexit supports to support companies, build commercial resilience and to maintain and increase export levels.</p>  <p>  In the pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors, exports to the United Kingdom account for approximately 6% of total exports. For IDA client companies, the continued functioning of the UK land bridge also remains important for the transport of final and intermediate products further afield. The use of the land bridge varies by product type; for example, the high-value, low-weight nature of final pharmaceutical products makes air transport a more logical choice relative to lower value, heavier products.</p>  <p>  The work of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport therefore remains important in this context, as is the engagement the Government has had with other EU Member States on minimising disruption to the land bridge. The Government will continue, in the time ahead, to engage with key stakeholders and inform businesses - whether those involved in medicines production or otherwise - on how best to prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  The issue of preserving supply chains of medicine and medical devices is also, of course, particularly important in the context of COVID-19. The Government has engaged extensively with both the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive on our response to the crisis, with the intention of delivering the best outcomes for all the people of the island. In April, a Memorandum of Understanding was formally agreed between the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive and senior officials from both sides remain in active dialogue on our collective response. </p></reply>

Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. </p><p>The objective of the Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme, administered on my Department's behalf by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector who have already started an online journey, to further enhance and strengthen their online presence, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer. </p><p>My Department proposed this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way. Further details on this Scheme available at .</p><p>The Scheme closed for applications on the 27 May 2020 and applications are currently under assessment by Enterprise Ireland. </p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme required that all applicants to the Scheme must be registered with the Companies Registration Office (CRO). There were some automatic technical entry issues in relation to CRO status for a number of applications on entry. The applicant, which the Deputy references, was one of a number of applications which were independently assessed by Enterprise Ireland after the closing date to examine eligibility in relation to their CRO status.  I understand that Enterprise Ireland has been in direct contact with all of those applicants, including the applicant in question, and have clarified eligibility of their application. All applicants deemed eligible go forward to be scored under this competitive call, which is in progress.</p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.</p></reply>

It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen. </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at .The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace.

Based on public health advice, this guidance document aims to assist businesses within the tourism sector in re-opening, helping them ensure that measures concerning health and safety are incorporated throughout all aspects of business operations in order to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.  </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.

It is not open to me however to initiate a Buy Irish campaign or to take other measures to influence consumers to buy Irish goods and services. In 1981, the European Commission took infringement proceedings against a Buy Irish campaign then in operation which received financial and other support from the Irish Government. In its subsequent judgment (<i>Commission v Ireland</i>, case C-249/81), the European Court of Justice held that the campaign was a reflection of the Irish Government&rsquo;s intention to substitute domestic products for imported products on the Irish market and thereby to check the flow of imports from other Member States.  A campaign of this kind was subject to the prohibition on measures that have equivalent effects to a quantitative restriction on imports under what is now Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In the view of the Court, even measures adopted by the government of a Member State which do not have binding effect may be capable of influencing the conduct of consumers and traders in that Member State and thus of frustrating the Treaty and the principle of the free movement of goods.  </p></reply>

Examples of what it could be used to support include:  </p><p>- Develop business continuity plan </p><p>- Assess current financial needs in the short term to medium term</p><p>- Reduce variable costs, overheads and expenses,</p><p>- Review and explore supply chain financing options</p><p>- Implement remote working processes or procedures</p><p>- Leverage HR expertise </p><p>- Leverage ICT expertise</p><p>- Prepare a business case for application to emergency financial interventions available through Banks, Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Micro Finance Ireland.</p><p>In this instance relating to two specific companies in Galway, I understand from the Local Enterprise Office in Galway that they have reviewed this case on three separate occasions, 7<sup>th</sup>May, 12<sup>th</sup>May and most recently on receipt of this Parliamentary Question.  On each occasion, LEO Galway has determined that the Business Continuity Voucher was unsuitable for the following reasons: </p><p>- Following communication with the applicant it was determined that the scale of the business or business model complexity in relation to the eligible uses of the Business Continuity Vouchers would not warrant the level of intervention proposed to be undertaken by the 3rd party accountant stated in the application as the preferred advisor whom had completed the application forms initially</p><p>- Subsequent discussion with the applicant in fact indicated concern mostly over post Covid operations in the absence of, at that time, published advice from HSA or publication of the the Return to Work Safely Protocol </p><p>- The client was advised that the most suitable support would be to avail of LEO Galway mentoring for post Covid back to work practices for both business and to review financials at that time once clarity on the businesses' post Covid business model was achieved</p><p>In the circumstances, LEO Galway, in keeping with LEO policy of offering alternative supports where possible, has offered mentoring to the business owners and I would urge them to take up this offer with the Local Enterprise Office in Galway.

The NOCT is led by the HSE and it is working to address the issue of outbreaks in meat processing plants with input from professionals in public health, environmental health, animal health and the Health and Safety Authority, in relation to occupational health and safety.  The NOCT and local Outbreak Control Teams are in place to address outbreaks of COVID-19 and to recommend steps and measures to ensure that current and future outbreaks can be managed and brought under control as quickly as possible. COVID-19 is first and foremost a public health issue so the first step must always be ensuring that measures are in place to manage and prevent outbreaks not just for the workers involved but also for the wider community where such workers live.</p>  <p>  As of Friday 5th June, the Health and Safety Authority has completed 19 inspections in meat plants in support of the NOCT. Of these 19 inspections, 16 involved plants where outbreaks have been recorded, some of the inspections were unannounced the majority were announced.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who have an ongoing role in meat processing plants, is also a member of the National Outbreak Control Team and they too will be checking compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol in such plants.</p></reply>

Further work will be carried out in the coming days and weeks to determine which actions will take place in each phase.  Updates to the roadmap can be found at www.gov.ie.  </p><p>The Roadmap is a living document and Government has demonstrated great flexibility in its decision to accelerate the phases as set out in the original Roadmap.  </p><p>The input and advice of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) informed the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with Phase 2 and to accelerate elements of the Roadmap. The Government also had regard to a paper which was developed by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide an updated assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify, from an economic perspective, some priority issues for re-opening of economic activity under Phase 2. This paper, &ldquo;Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity - Update for Phase 2&rdquo;, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at . </p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>June the Minister for Health, Simon Harris T.D., signed SI No.206 of 2020, Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions)(COVID-19)(No. 2) Regulations.  These Regulations, which shall remain in operation until 29<sup>th</sup>June, provide for the unwinding of certain restrictions, including the reopening of retail outlets and extending the distance that may be travelled for specified purposes. The Regulations also provide for continued restrictions for some businesses or services and for offences, including in relation to events. Businesses should carefully review these Regulations.  </p><p>Where a business is not specifically listed in SI No.206 of 2020, it should review the Roadmap and the updates carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of its activities with regard to the continuing public health measures. Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen. </p><p>Bodies such as the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the HSE and the HSA have provided guidance, advice and best practice for a number of sectors in that regard.</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Retail Protection and Improvement Guide&rsquo; helps retailers manage business continuity during the COVID-19 emergency. The NSAI will also be publishing guidelines for shopping centres in the coming days. Please visit www.nsai.ie for further updates.</p><p>In response to their request, I met recently with members of the hairdressing and beauty industry via teleconference where they discussed developing guidelines and safety protocols, with reference to the Government&rsquo;s Return to Work Safely Protocol. I requested that, where sectors are developing such protocols or guides, they should work together to align this work. Last week the Irish Hairdressing Federation submitted their protocol to my Department and I have sent this  to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Simon Harris TD and to the HSE.</p><p>In line with the national Return to Work Safely protocol, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in association with relevant authorities and following consultation with all industry sectors, has published guidelines for reopening of various sectors of the tourism industry and these are available here .  Based on public health advice, this guidance document aims to assist businesses within the tourism sector in re-opening, helping them ensure that measures concerning health and safety are incorporated throughout all aspects of business operations in order to reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.  </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and employees the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at .The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the National Return to Work Safely Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors under Phases 1 and 2 and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap. </p><p>It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the next two phases of the Roadmap will be informed by the public health advice at the time.</p></reply>

Also approved at that Government meeting were proposals which required amendments to two other Acts - the Microfinance Loan Fund Act 2012 and the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working urgently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on priority drafting all of these amendments since the beginning of May to progress all of these amendments as a matter of urgency.  </p>  <p>The amendments which are being made to the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 are necessary to facilitate Microfinance Ireland (MFI) to be able to borrow moneys from bodies other than its parent body, the Social Finance Foundation, and to raise the ceiling on the amount of Exchequer grant that can be provided to Microfinance Ireland.  This is intended to allow MFI to have access to greater sources of funding, to enhance its ability to provide more microenterprise loans to those qualifying enterprises in need of financing support.  The amendments to the European Investment Fund Agreement Act 2018 will increase the ceiling from &euro;75 million to &euro;500 million on agreements which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or myself, with the consent of both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may enter into with the European Investment Fund.  This will allow the Government to respond to the Covid19 crisis by increasing the size of the Future Growth Loan Scheme and other schemes for Irish enterprises.  The Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020, which will amend the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012 (as amended) and the European Investment Fund Act 2018, was approved for publication at Cabinet on Friday 29th May last.</p>  <p>  Separately, the implementation of the new Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme requires amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 (as amended).  Since the Government approved the scheme, officials in my Department have been working urgently alongside the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the priority drafting of the necessary legislation and are also continuing to work with the steering group to design and operationalise the scheme as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  My priority is to ensure that both of these Bills can be progressed through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency following the formation of a new Government.  I am very aware of the pressure for enterprise to access these supports in order to be able to resume economic activity and hope that all Parliamentarians will facilitate its urgent commencement.</p></reply>

My Department, IDA Ireland and the other enterprise agencies under my remit are determined to source new investment and employment opportunities for Clare that will help offset many of these job losses. </p>  <p>  The Mid-West Regional Enterprise Plan, which I launched last year, will be a critical tool in that respect. This plan is designed to support the growth of business in the Mid-West and its implementation will help to create quality new jobs for the region.  IDA Ireland, for its part, has been continuously engaging with Molex through frequent meetings with senior executives in Shannon. The Agency continues to work proactively to attract and win new investment for Shannon as part of the Mid-West region. They are also working to preserve and grow existing multinational operations in the region with a particular focus on increased global business services and high-tech manufacturing investments.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the overall outlook of foreign direct investment (FDI) remains positive for the Mid-West. The region witnessed the creation of 1,133 net new jobs by IDA Ireland client companies in 2019 with County Clare accounting for 222 of these net new jobs. The region has also witnessed significant investment over the last three years and key employers in the region include many large-scale manufacturing employers such as Becton Dickinson, Edwards Lifesciences, Analog Devices, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Stryker and Zimmer. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this broadly positive FDI landscape for the Mid-West, I am determined, together with the IDA, to intensify our efforts in attracting new investments and jobs for those who have been impacted by the Molex announcement.</p></reply>

Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. An interest rate to 4.5% applies on the Covid-19 loans provided by MFI.  This reduced rate is available to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the Local Enterprise Network or referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. The new rate for direct applications to MFI is reduced to 5.5%.As these loans are available interest free for the first six months, the net effect is to further reduce the net interest rate payable over the period of the loan. </p><p>My Department is encouraging any affected business to take advantage of the LEO COVID-19 supports. The situation is still developing from day to day and the Government continues to respond to these developments in an effort to protect and support Irish businesses. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Vouchers (BCV) and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.  </p><p>InterTradeIreland launched two new business supports, these are currently being targeted at companies who are already on one of their programs. <i>E-merge </i>enables companies to engage consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2500/&euro;2800) to help them develop online sales &amp;amp; ecommerce solutions. </p><p><i>Emergency Business Solutions:</i>Fully funded consultancy support &amp;amp; advice (to the value of &pound;2000/&euro;2250) to address key business challenges in areas such as emergency cashflow, loan applications and HR/People.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak will result in a serious downturn in the Irish, EU and wider global economy. The downturn will be sudden and wide reaching. Businesses, the labour market and household spending will all be negatively impacted. To assist companies to respond to these challenges, and in doing so stabilise and rebuild their business, Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has launched a suite of COVID-19 supports; these are: </p><p><b>- Sustaining Enterprise Fund</b><i>:</i>This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15 per cent or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objectives of the scheme are to:</p><p>- Ensure eligible companies have access to the necessary liquidity; and</p><p>- Sustain business so that companies can return to viability and contribute to the recovery of the Irish economy.</p><p>The Fund will provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.</p><p>This fund will provide a &euro;25k to &euro;50k short term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly in 3-years&rsquo; time.  </p><p><b>- COVID 19 &ndash; HPSU Fund (SEF &ndash; HPSU):</b>This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies who, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projectedales growth and whose fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000<b></b>per undertaking in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p><b>- Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: </b>A &euro;5k grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. </p><p><b>- Lean Business Continuity Voucher: </b>A &euro;2.5k voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. </p><p><b>- Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme</b>is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p><b>- Restart Grant:</b>This grant provides direct grant aid to micro and small businesses. The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers.</p><p>Funding in respect to the Restart Grant is provided by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and is administered by the 31 Local Authorities.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland provides support for new start-ups and existing business through a wide range of initiatives and supports. The awarding of funding by the agency is based on eligibility, evaluation criteria and assessed company need. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review.</p></reply>

The protocol incorporates current advice about measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community as issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). As the advice issued by NPHET continues to evolve, this Protocol and the measures employers and workers need to address in the workplace may also change. The Protocol is, therefore, a living document insofar as details in the Protocol are non-exhaustive and are also subject to change as necessary. The Protocol is generally aimed at worker and public health protection and strong communication and a shared collaborative approach between employers and workers will be key in protecting against the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Data Protection will play an important role in this success, where employers feel confident that they are meeting their data protection obligations and workers feel their personal data and right to privacy is protected in the workplace. It is intended to provide additional guidance within the Protocol on Data Protection matters to assist employers and employees in meeting requirements.</p><p>I would add that matters concerning the organisation and delivery of contact tracing systems is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

The Oireachtas put in place a robust legal framework, in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, to give full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. By assessing medicines in this manner, we help ensure that the finite resources of our heath service are used most effectively. </p>  <p>  The legislative underpinning of the 2013 Act is backed up by the Framework Agreement on the Supply of Medicines 2016-2020 between the State and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA).  This Agreement contains a number of measures intended to increase sustainable drug access and supply, including setting prices relative to those in other EU member states, reviewing prices to achieve better value for money and formal health technology assessment of new treatments to inform reimbursement decision making.</p>  <p>  The Framework Agreement shall continue in force until 31 July 2020, unless continued by mutual agreement of the parties.

The Report identified around 4000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.</p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>Time to Move On from Congregated Settings is progressing and continues to demonstrate very positive results for service users who have transitioned to living in homes in community settings. Overall, the population in congregated settings at the year end will be 50% lower than those identified in the original report with less than 2,000 people remaining in congregated settings.</p><p>I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres.

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The 3 medical conditions are:</p><p>- spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p><p>- intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>- severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>To date three products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019.

Full eligibility is determined primarily by reference to income limits. Determination of an individuals eligibility status is the responsibility of the HSE.  </p>  <p>  Individuals with full eligibility can access a range of services including General Practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.Individuals with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services, subject to certain charges. Other services such as allied healthcare professional services may also be made available to persons with limited eligibility. </p>  <p>  A General Practitioner (GP) Visit Card provides for eligible individuals to visit a participating GP service without fees and also covers visits to GP out-of-hours service. GP's are independent practitioners, many of whom hold contracts with the HSE for the provision of services to medical card and GP visit card holders. It should be noted that all individuals over the age of 70 are automatically eligible for a GP visit card.   </p>  <p>  Individuals with full eligibility who access services from a GP who holds a GMS Contract with the HSE are eligible to have their prescribed medicines provided free subject to the application of the prescription charge.   Persons who elect to attend a GP that does not hold a contract with the HSE may apply to avail of the Drugs Payment Scheme which provides for a maximum payment of &euro;124 per month for approved prescribed drugs, medicines and certain appliances for themselves and/or their family. This scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and, as the Deputy is aware, the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at .</p> <blockquote> 	The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:<br /><br />1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:<br /><br />a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,<br /><br />b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,<br /><br />c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,<br /><br />d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,<br /><br />e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.<br /><br />2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.<br /><br />3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.<br /><br />4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.<br /><br />As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.<br /><br />The current public health advice regarding travel is that people are asked to stay local. People may travel within their own county, or 20 kilometres from home if crossing county boundaries, to visit local venues or amenities such as parks and shops that have reopened as part of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap. The regulatory framework underpinning this public health advice is Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI No. 206 of 2020). Travel for essential purposes is permitted under the regulations.  </blockquote></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p></reply>

At this time, walk-in clinics are not generally being provided and patients are asked to phone their GP initially to discuss their medical problem. GPs are performing assessments over the phone to determine if a patient needs to attend the surgery. Many problems can be resolved over the phone or by video consultation, some can be helped by the secure transfer of a prescription to the pharmacist while others may need referral to other services.  Where clinically indicated, the GP will arrange an appointment to see the patient in the surgery.  These measures are necessary to ensure the safety of patients, GPs, and practice staff.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  Department officials engaged with the insurers at the outset of the private hospitals agreement. In order to assist health insurance customers impacted by the Covid-19 national response, each of the insurers have announced a range of supportive measures for their customers. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p></reply>

As part of this coordinated response, all stakeholders have committed to developing approaches and implementing contingencies to address any identified concerns. </p><p>Arising from this detailed and ongoing engagement, there is no evidence to suggest that Ireland is likely to face general medicines supply issues, now or in the near future, as a result of any potential delays in the supply chain caused by Covid-19 related issues. Supply chains remain strong, however, these remain under ongoing review and international authorities, including the European Medicines Agency, remain vigilant to any potential risk. The Department of Health and the HPRA are also working as part of this wider EU response to Covid-19.</p><p>In addition to direct and specific engagement with the marketing authorisation holders of medicines the Department has hosted a number of multi-stakeholder conference calls with the pharmaceutical industry, including Medicines for Ireland, and other actors in the pharmaceutical supply chain, such as wholesalers and community pharmacists. The most recent of these events took place yesterday, 8th June. </p><p>I am grateful for the continuous engagement of all stakeholders in this process. I recognise and value the work which gone into contingency planning, and other measures to mitigate the risks to medicines supplies at this time. Through this continued engagement and open communication with all stakeholders, a unified approach has been taken to mitigate the risks to the supply of medicines to treat Covid-19 patients and to maintain continuity of treatment for all other patients.</p></reply>

However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people.  </p><p>The resumption of adult day services is currently being considered by my Department and the HSE as part of broader planning to prepare for the resumption of non-COVID-19 community and social care services in the current environment, and in line with public health guidance. My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity. </p><p>The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-covid supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the Disability Sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. Community Healthcare Organisations and Section 38/39 agencies continue to work together at a regional level in order to plan and co-ordinate efforts. Considering the very serious nature of this pandemic and the vulnerability of people with disabilities as a care group, any plans to safely commence all disability services and supports must comply with guidance developed by the National Public Surveillance Centre  in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE has now developed a number of important guidance documents to assist disability services: the Framework for Resumption of Adult Day Services and Reshaping Disability Services From 2020 &amp;amp; Beyond. It is important to note that this guidance is interim and subject to change in line with the overall management of the Covid-19 pandemic and in accordance with contemporary Public Health Guidance.</p><p>These documents are now also available on the following website:</p></reply>

The differences between simpler chemically synthesised medicines and far more complex medicines produced from cell cultures of living organisms are such that they necessitate a difference in policy approach to these categories of medicine. The HSE and my Department are actively engaged in implementing domestic policies to maximise efficiency in our medicines usage. </p>  <p>  In terms of biosimilar medicines for example, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme (AHDMP) has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017. This is making considerable progress using a collaborative to bring about changes in prescribing practice. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE Medicines Management Programme completed an evaluation process in 2019 for the identification of the best-value biological (BVB) medicines for TNF-α inhibitors under the High-Tech Drug arrangements. </p>  <p>  In June 2019, the HSE introduced a system of gain-share to encourage the prescribing of the BVB medicines which has been largely successful in increasing uptake of these medicines.</p>  <p>  To the end of April, the HSE has estimated savings of &euro;14.5m in 2020 from biosimilar switching initiatives. Should this trend continue to year end, savings of approximately &euro;30m have been forecast for 2020. </p>  <p>  In relation to your specific data requests, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly as they have responsibility for this area.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p></reply>

Specific scenarios where a compassionate and practical approach is required include care of the dying.</p><p>  Regarding the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, the person concerned is being cared for in a residential care setting. Interim Public Health and Infection Prevention Control Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities published by the HSE on 4 May 2020 state that all but essential visiting by family and friends is suspended in the interests of protecting residents at this time. However, the Guidelines also acknowledge that a compassionate, pragmatic and proportionate approach is required in the care of those who are dying. The presence of a person close to the resident should be facilitated in so far as it is possible, and they should be aware of the potential infection risk. All Covid-19 guidance documents note the need for hand and respiratory hygiene and for the wearing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when required and that relatives are informed of the potential risk of infection to both the patient/resident and visitors.</p><p>  Most hospices have all single room accommodation and are therefore in a better position to facilitate visits to patients at end of life; however, most residential care settings have multi-bedded rooms and need to be particularly cautious in balancing the needs of patients and their families with the protection of the health of visitors, other residents and the staff working in the unit. It is acknowledged by all services that restricted visiting causes significant stress and concern for individuals and families, as well as for the staff who are caring for them. </p><p>  From 15 June,  in accordance with guidance published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HSPSC), there will be a phased commencement of visiting at hospitals, residential healthcare centres and other residential settings where there is no ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, subject to limits on the number of visitors and the length of their visits. Visitors are asked to bear in mind the particular features of types of settings and each individual centre, also considering PPE availability and other protections. It is hoped that the easing of visiting restrictions will be able to facilitate the much needed closer contact between family members and loved ones. </p><p>  In the meantime, as the specific details referred to in the Deputy's question refer to a service matter, this matter has been referred to the HSE for reply. </p></reply>

Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a.

The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p><p>I appointed Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins as Chair of this Committee in 2019 and asked that, as part of its initial body of work, the Committee prioritise a review of the national newborn blood-spot screening programme and look specifically at how Ireland should best proceed with an expansion in line with international best practice.Any future potential changes to the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme will be incorporated as part of the Committee's work programme.</p><p>Ireland, has always evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against international accepted criteria &ndash; collectively known as the Wilson Jungner criteria. The evidence bar for commencing a screening programme should and must remain high. This ensures that we can be confident that the programme is effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards. There is no doubt that newborn screening programmes have the potential to be rapidly transformed by new technologies and new therapies but this highlights the need to continue with a robust, methodologically sound and detailed analysis of the evidence in each and every case against internationally accepted screening criteria.</p><p>However, it is most likely that over the course of the next 5 years we are likely to see an incremental expansion of the bloodspot programme that will screen for new conditions. </p><p>Updates in relation to screening will be posted on the NSAC website ().</p></reply>

The current advice is that you should follow social distancing guidance everywhere outside the home, including keeping a physical distance of 2 metres apart. It is also recommended that face coverings be worn in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as shops, and on public transport, or when meeting someone who is vulnerable to the virus, for example people who are cocooning. The recommendation applies to those people aged over 13 who can tolerate them. </p>  <p>  This advice is kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team on a continuing basis. Arising from their meeting of 4 June, 2020, the National Public Health Emergency Team has requested that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre develop guidance on the application of existing social distancing requirements in specific, defined and controlled environments in the hospitality industry during periods of low incidence of the disease. This guidance will then be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team on completion. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that on 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19. </p></reply>

Since 15 April there have been five Informal Video Conferences of Health Ministers where a wide range of Covid-19 related issues were discussed. This followed on from two extraordinary EPSCO meetings in Brussels in February and March to discuss the Covid-19 response.</p>  <p>  There is also ongoing, close engagement with the Northern Ireland authorities in a variety of forums, at both political and official level, both on a North-South basis and as part of broader engagement with the United Kingdom, including in relation to international travel.</p>  <p>  Ireland pays close attention to all guidance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The guidelines developed by ECDC and the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) are welcome in providing clarity to carriers and passengers about how to minimise the risk of transmission during a flight. However, even with the recommendations of the ECDC/EASA report fully implemented, air travel should not be viewed as risk free. The guidelines do not address the broader risks that increased non-essential international travel will present, including the possible importation of cases.</p>  <p>  In the absence of a test that definitively shows that a passenger arriving from overseas neither has nor is incubating the virus, the public health advice for passengers is to self-isolate during the 14 days &ndash; the duration of possible incubation - after they arrive into the State from overseas.</p></reply>

Where possible, hospitals are working to provide services in a different way, which includes virtual clinics for some out-patient department appointments.  The potential for certain hospitals, including private hospitals, to provide non-Covid care has been recognised as part of the solution for ensuring continuation of time-critical care, including cancer surgery, during the first phase of the pandemic.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on scheduled care waiting lists, with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care. </p><p>The HSE has advised that it is working to develop a strategic framework for service continuity, as part of re-establishing services across all settings, including acute settings. I expect that consideration of how and where Covid and non-Covid acute services will be delivered in the next phase of the pandemic will be informed by that work. </p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. The NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working with National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to establish a mechanism to allow for return of electronic data from Private Hospitals. This system went live the week ending the18th May with guidance issued to private hospitals around the process for submission of data. In order to ensure early reporting of activity the HSE has put a manual data reporting system in place with private hospitals. This supports the return of a limited dataset which remains subject to validation based on electronic data returns through the NTPF. </p>  <p>  My Department has been advised of the following preliminary activity figures for Clane Hospital (UPMC Kildare) from the start of the arrangement until 28 May 2020 - 118 inpatient/ daycase/ diagnostics and 390 outpatient appointments.  </p></reply>

Phase 1 was introduced on 18 May 2020 and, as the Deputy is aware, the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at .  </p><p>The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria: </p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease, </p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing, </p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups, </p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework described above, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made.</p><p>On 9 May the &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers&rdquo; was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.</p><p>The services described in the Deputy&rsquo;s question are not matters within the remit of my Department. Guidance in relation to specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector.</p></reply>

This information was sent by the Department to the HSE on the same day for their attention and the HSE has confirmed on-going risk management of these centres.</p>  <p>  On 29th and 30th of March key officials from the Department, HIQA, HPSC and HSE met to discuss nursing homes. It was agreed that representatives from the Department, HIQA, HSE and HSPC would collaborate to prepare a paper, encompassing a framework of necessary information, for consideration by the NPHET at its meeting of 31st March on the specific issues and risks relating to COVID-19 infections in residential healthcare facilities. To inform the development of the paper, HIQA provided an information framework document to the team on March 30th. A variety of potential risks were identified. These included the risk of small providers, access to infection prevention and control (IPC) advice, access to PPE and timely access to testing. Following consideration of the paper referred to at the above NPHET meeting of 31st March, NPHET requested HIQA to risk assess all nursing homes and liaise with relevant national and regional governance structures as necessary in light of mitigating actions. This was part of an overall package of public health measures recommended following this meeting. </p>  <p>  At the NPHET meeting 17th April an action was agreed that &lsquo;HIQA publishes and assesses a COVID-19 Quality Assurance Regulatory Framework&rsquo;. This Framework has been designed to ensure that providers are prepared for, and have contingency plans in place for, an outbreak of COVID-19. As part of the programme HIQA has developed a self-assessment tool for nursing home providers. This self-assessment tool sets out the minimum standard required to effectively respond to an outbreak of COVID-19 in a designated centre. This involves a self-assessment by the registered provider and an onsite assessment by inspectors of social services to verify the provider&rsquo;s compliance against specified regulations. </p>  <p>  If further action is required by the registered provider to ensure compliance with the specified regulations, a compliance plan will be issued to the registered provider by the inspector of social services following the in-site assessment. </p>  <p>  I note that during the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response debate on the 26th May 2020, in discussion on this particular matter, HIQA was requested by the Chairperson of the Committee that institutions not be named. HIQA is engaging with all providers in the context of the regulatory framework and as noted, compliance plans are issued by HIQA, as appropriate. </p></reply>

This necessitates flexibility in the composition of these national teams in order that they can appropriately respond to major public health emergencies. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the NPHET for COVID-19 is accountable to me as Minister for Health and is made up of senior public officials of the Department of Health and a number of relevant State Agencies, in addition to highly qualified subject matter experts from disciplines such as virology, infectious diseases, intensive care etc. who are among the leading practitioners in their fields in this country. </p>  <p>  The NPHET can add to its membership on the basis of the additional expertise or support it identifies as being required so as to ensure that it is in the best possible position to provide the advice and recommendations for consideration by the Minister for Health and the Government. These are the criteria on which the NPHET identifies the requirement for particular expertise. This flexibility in approach to selection is necessary for a group such as this in the context of an international public health crisis of the kind we are currently experiencing due to the pandemic, and give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the WHO. </p>  <p>  A wide range of documentation related to NPHET, including as regards the governance process under which operates, has been published to date and it is intended to continue this process to ensure that the process by which the NPHET's recommendations have been reached is as transparent as possible. </p></reply>

Specific scenarios where a compassionate and practical approach is required include care of the dying.</p><p>  Regarding the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, the person concerned is being cared for in a residential care setting. Interim Public Health and Infection Prevention Control Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities published by the HSE on 4 May 2020 state that all but essential visiting by family and friends is suspended in the interests of protecting residents at this time. However, the Guidelines also acknowledge that a compassionate, pragmatic and proportionate approach is required in the care of those who are dying. The presence of a person close to the resident should be facilitated in so far as it is possible, and they should be aware of the potential infection risk. All Covid-19 guidance documents note the need for hand and respiratory hygiene and for the wearing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) when required and that relatives are informed of the potential risk of infection to both the patient/resident and visitors.</p><p>  Most hospices have all single room accommodation and are therefore in a better position to facilitate visits to patients at end of life; however, most residential care settings have multi-bedded rooms and need to be particularly cautious in balancing the needs of patients and their families with the protection of the health of visitors, other residents and the staff working in the unit. It is acknowledged by all services that restricted visiting causes significant stress and concern for individuals and families, as well as for the staff who are caring for them. </p><p>  From 15 June,  in accordance with guidance published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HSPSC), there will be a phased commencement of visiting at hospitals, residential healthcare centres and other residential settings where there is no ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, subject to limits on the number of visitors and the length of their visits. Visitors are asked to bear in mind the particular features of types of settings and each individual centre, also considering PPE availability and other protections. It is hoped that the easing of visiting restrictions will be able to facilitate the much needed closer contact between family members and loved ones. </p><p>  In the meantime, as the specific details referred to in the Deputy's question refer to a service matter, this matter has been referred to the HSE for reply. </p></reply>

The measures approved by NPHET will impact a number of areas such as workflow, patient pathways, patient engagement and communication, infrastructure, physical distancing, capacity and resources. The HSE advise that the capacity that will be available under these measures will vary from one site to the next and from one service to the next; currently new patient pathways are being established and tested however full year capacity has not been fully established at this point.  </p><p>  Additionally, in order to continue to provide access for patients there has been a considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations for many specialties across the system. The HSE advise that based on submissions from 36 sites, a total of 80,730 virtual outpatient consultations took place in April. This represents approximately 50% of the overall OPD activity for April.

However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families.

My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity. </p><p>The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-covid supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the Disability Sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. Community Healthcare Organisations and Section 38/39 agencies continue to work together at a regional level in order to plan and co-ordinate efforts. Considering the very serious nature of this pandemic and the vulnerability of people with disabilities as a care group, any plans to safely commence all disability services and supports must comply with guidance developed by the National Public Surveillance Centre  in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE has now developed a number of important guidance documents to assist disability services: the Framework for Resumption of Adult Day Services and Reshaping Disability Services From 2020 &amp;amp; Beyond. It is important to note that this guidance is interim and subject to change in line with the overall management of the Covid-19 pandemic and in accordance with contemporary Public Health Guidance.</p><p>These documents are now also available on the following website:</p><p>In relation to transport services for people travelling to disability services, COVID guidance on social distancing and infection control presents many challenges for the provision of transport to and from day service locations.

The Executive developed guidance on the commencement and maintenance of treatment and on the safe supply of medicines during COVID-19. This included the delivery of OST to individuals who were in self-isolation or cocooning. In April 2020,  an additional 514 people were in receipt of OST compared with January 2020. </p>  <p>  In the last quarter of 2019, my Department commenced an evaluation process of the benefits or otherwise of introducing nurse prescribing of OST.

The MOU was entered into on my behalf as Minister for Health and on behalf of the Minister of Health in Northern Ireland to strengthen North South co-operation on the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The MOU focuses on facilitating greater co-operation and consistency of approach wherever possible on areas such as public health messaging, programmes of behavioural change, evidence base/ modelling and contact tracing.  </p>  <p>  I have been in ongoing contact with the Minister of Health in Northern Ireland throughout this pandemic in relation to how each health system is implementing various public health responses. In addition, there has been significant engagement between the CMOs, and officials in both jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Calls are held regularly including at a technical level to facilitate information sharing on topics such as modelling, testing and contact tracing approaches, tracing apps and travel measures. </p>  <p>  The administrations are seeking to adopt similar approaches, where it is appropriate to do so on the advice of respective Chief Medical Officers. Discussions have and will continue to take place on respective plans for the gradual and controlled easing of restrictions, given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible. All parties recognise that in terms of public health measures in both jurisdictions, that it will be important to maintain strong North/South collaborative arrangements.</p></reply>

I have agreed with the HSE that such information would be made available on a weekly basis.</p><p>The HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has prepared a summary of confirmed cases in healthcare workers (HCWs). As of the 30th May at midnight, the HPSC has advised that 8,018 cases of COVID-19 are in HCWs. This is 32% of all confirmed cases. This does not mean that 32% of all HCWs have COVID-19, as has been mis-reported, but rather that 32% of all cases in Ireland have occurred in someone who has reported being a HCW. </p><p>The HPSC advises that the number of HCW cases has been declining week on week since mid-April. In the week 22 (24-30 May), there were 103 new COVID-19 confirmed cases in HCWs. This compares to 145 in week 21 and 470 in week 20.  </p><p>My Department is advised that the transmission route for HCWs is sought through the contact tracing process. A broad approach is taken when determining if a HCW confirmed case acquired it in a healthcare setting. This broad approach may lead to an overestimation of healthcare setting transmission. The HPSC advises that if a HCW is noted as a confirmed case and has one of the following, their mode of transmission is recorded as &quot;healthcare setting acquired&quot;:</p><p>Confirmed mode of transmission is healthcare setting acquired or</p><p>Close contact with another confirmed case of COVID-19 in a healthcare or workplace setting or</p><p>Linked to an outbreak in a healthcare setting.</p><p>The HPSC advises that 60% of cases in healthcare workers have &quot;healthcare setting acquired&quot; recorded as the likely source of transmission.  </p><p>My Department and I are having a further meeting with the trade unions today. </p></reply>

There is extensive guidance in place for healthcare workers and this can be found on the HPSC website: . There is also clear guidance in place for the assessment, testing and return to work of healthcare workers.  </p><p>The HSE has advised that where healthcare workers, including home support workers, require a test, they are prioritised and there is no delay in scheduling a test appointment. Where a person in receipt of home support requires a test, this is also the case.</p><p>In addition, current guidance requires the testing of all staff and residents when a new case emerges in a long term residential care facility (including mental health facilities) that have not yet had a case.  </p><p>It is important to note that testing is only one element of a comprehensive strategic response to COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test.  </p><p>Targeted, risk-based testing can yield important data to inform control measures, but does not constitute a control measure in and of itself. Testing should only be undertaken based on a public health risk assessment.

The shortage is due to a manufacturing site change and other changes to the manufacturing process of this particular product and the resulting shortage is not confined to the Irish market. The company is taking all possible steps to ensure that normal supply resumes as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  However, in order to mitigate any impact of the shortage to patients, the company is supplying the product it places on the Australian market under a different brand name, Dilantin Infatabs 50mg Chewable Tablets, to meet the needs of Irish patients. This product contains the same active ingredient, phenytoin, and is owned by the same company.</p>  <p>  On the 9th of October 2019, healthcare professionals were alerted in advance of the shortage, advising that pharmacy staff and patients should be made aware of the issue and of the replacement product that would be made available. A copy of this letter is available on the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) website. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicine shortage framework in place, coordinated by the HPRA, in order to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The HPRA remains in regular contact with the MAH regarding the interruption in supply of Epanutin 50mg Infatabs.</p>  <p>  Patients or their carers who have any questions or concerns in relation to the temporary alternative presentation of phenytoin are advised to speak with their pharmacist or other healthcare professional responsible for their epilepsy care.</p></reply>

It notes that while visiting restrictions will be required in a pandemic, local risk assessment and practical management must be considered, ensuring the response is both pragmatic and proportionate.

It  sets out the criteria for visiting residential care facilities with no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and for visiting residential care facilities during an outbreak of COVID-19. Indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will be permissible from 15 June in circumstances where certain criteria are followed. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff.  </p></reply>

It will fully consume the budget of &euro;56m that was allocated to it for the period 2014 to 2020.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has more than achieved its targets in terms of new land converted and the maintenance of organic land.  Latest figures indicate that there are now some 74,000 hectares under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the Programme in 2014.</p>  <p>  As there has been a delay in agreeing the EU budget and the new CAP reform regulations, transitional arrangements will be made to provide legal and financial certainty for RDP schemes for 2021. The European Commission has therefore introduced draft transitional Regulations to cover the period between the current RDP which expires this year and the commencement of the next. These transitional regulations which will govern the position of schemes in 2021 have not yet been finalised.</p></reply>

More than ever in the ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of this need for ongoing contact as the situation has evolved.  My Department and I are working to ensure that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that are necessary to protect farm incomes can continue. </p>  <p>  There are likely to be significant economic impacts for the agri-food sector, arising from reduced demand in key markets around the world.  The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.</p>  <p>  The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. These supports include Aids to Private Storage and Exceptional Aid measures, flexibilities when it comes to on-farm inspections and early payment of the Basic Payment Scheme. </p>  <p>  Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (SMP, Butter, Cheese), Beef and Sheepmeat.   Private Storage Aid (PSA) is a risk management tool/safety net available to EU producers of certain agricultural products under the CMO regulation (1308/2013).

Nutrient management planning is therefore an integral part of the nutrient use efficiency on farm.</p>  <p>  The application of lime is a key component of nutrient management planning. The usage of lime has declined in recent decades although sales have stabilised in recent years. There is ongoing research, advisory emphasis and industry promotion on the importance and benefits of lime application to our soils and this has helped to raise awareness and promote usage amongst farmers. </p>  <p>  An interim review of the Nitrates Derogation was carried out in 2019, following which farmers in derogation must now put in place a farm scale liming programme from 2020, which provides an opportunity for these farmers to improve efficiencies and to reduce their environmental footprint.  A review of Ireland Nitrates Action will be conducted this year whereby nutrient management planning will be reviewed.  </p>  <p>  In many instances, the improvements in fertiliser efficiency resulting from the judicious application of lime may reduce input costs on farms and improve profitability.  </p></reply>

All private forest owners are eligible to participate, irrespective of their forest currently being grant funded under the Forestry Programmes or not. Participants set their own learning agenda, led by a facilitator who is a professional forester. All private forest owners are eligible to participate in groups, irrespective of whether their forest is grant funded.</p>  <p>I am pleased to confirm that I opened this year&rsquo;s Forestry KTG Scheme on 27th   May 2020 following the successful implementation of the scheme in 2018 and 2019. Applications to establish and run a national network of Knowledge Transfer Groups are now invited from forestry groups, forestry companies and individual forestry professionals.  Once approval has issued by the Department, successful applicants will then invite forest owners to take part in the group they are running.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Scheme&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions, each Knowledge Transfer Group can have a maximum of 20 participants. The minimum number of participants per KTG is 10. This means that an Organiser can apply for 2 KTGs with 10 participants each. Organisers should bear in mind that the average attendance over the seven meetings/events must be 10 or more in order to qualify for the full organiser payment where one or two KTGs are being organised as part of a KTG Application. </p>  <p>  Approved KTG Organisers can receive a payment of up to &euro;6,500 for each group they facilitate. Participants are eligible to receive &euro;70 per meeting attended, provided they have participated in at least 4 of the 7 KTG meetings and events.</p>  <p>  Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government currently has measures in place which will be subject to updates and modifications over the coming months. The purpose of launching the scheme now is to allow time for organisers to recruit members to their groups, with a view to commencing meetings later in the year in line with the public health guidelines. The scheme will, of course, be kept under review in light of those guidelines.</p></reply>

Every application for a forestry licence must undergo careful assessment for the potential effects the proposed operations may have on their own or in combination with other plans or projects in the area.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department made changes to the assessment procedures used when examining all forestry licence applications.  These changes were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC).  These findings meant that, in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. These changes, which are substantial, have led to delays in processing applications. My Department has devoted considerable time and energy to introducing a robust and workable system and is now recruiting significant extra resources, both ecologists and forestry inspectors, to address the backlog.</p>  <p>  On initial examination of this particular application, it was determined that 15 designated sites were proximate to the tree felling site.  The possibility that the proposed tree felling may have an impact on any one of these sites cannot yet be excluded.  Therefore, officials of my Department will complete the Appropriate Assessment report and determination.  It is also open to the the person named to have a Natura Impact Statement completed by a suitably qualified person at their own expense and submit it for review by my Department&rsquo;s Ecology Unit which can considerably speed up consideration of the file. </p>  <p>  Once the assessment of the application is complete, the forestry inspector will make their recommendations, which will form the decision on the application.  The decision will be issued to the person named and any person who made a submission on the application.  The decision may be appealed to the Forestry Appeals Committee within 28 days.</p></reply>

The issue of a Condition Red Notice is a comparatively rare occurrence and outlines the level of risk involved and specifies measures that may need to be taken in response to this. A high state of readiness existed following the issue of this warning, which was widely reported in the media.  </p>  <p>  The fire Danger Notice contained a reminder to the public to remain within 5km of their homes when exercising and to adhere to the regulations introduced to limit the spread of Covid-19. The notice also contained a request for forest visitors to park considerately near site entrances so as not to impede emergency service access to forest roads.  </p>  <p>  The parking of vehicles or obstruction of public roads are matters for An Garda Siochana and the relevant Local Authority. Neither my Department nor Coillte have enforcement powers in relation to this. However, Coillte works closely with An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to ensure that vital access routes remain clear. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of the recent fires during the period of the June Bank Holiday weekend and has been monitoring the situation with regard to impacts on forest lands. There were a number of fires on Coillte lands in Laois, Galway, Mayo and Leitrim with significant outbreaks occurring in Kildare and Louth. In all cases, Coillte staff and its contractors worked with emergency services &ndash; particularly Fire Services &ndash; Local Authorities and local people to contain dangerous forest fires, to protect our forest estate and to prevent the spread of fire from the forest to nearby residences and businesses.</p>  <p>  Coillte takes fire management on its forest estate extremely seriously. Coillte has 85 dedicated and fully trained fire management staff who are available continuously, 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the fire season to coordinate and fight forest fires. Coillte also has a full range of fire-fighting equipment constantly prepared for fire outbreak. In addition, Coillte has two helicopters on contract, fully equipped with fire-fighting equipment, available for use at all times. Coillte has been very active on national media, local media and on social media, promoting the message of fire awareness and prevention including the need to keep forest entrances clear and not to block access roads to our forests. The last point applies at all times, not just during periods of high fire risk.</p>  <p>  In view of the present prolonged period of dry weather, high temperatures and strong winds, the risk of further fire outbreaks remains across the country. Coillte will continue to promote fire awareness and prevention and my Department will continue to issue forest fire warnings where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I would like to take the opportunity to thank the various Fire Service, Coillte workers and Defence Forces personnel who have been involved in the sustained response to these fires in recent weeks.  These fires present an enormous and additional challenge at a time when services and communities are already under serious pressure, and I commend the work of all those who have been involved in the response.</p>  <p>  My Department does not operate a compensation scheme for landowners affected by fire. Insurance against fire damage is readily available in the marketplace and it is incumbent on all landowners and property owners living in rural areas to be aware of fire risk on their lands at all times and to take steps to reduce fire risks to property, habitats and other assets. </p></reply>

However, there has been a particularly strong demand for potatoes at retail level in recent months and the majority of the potatoes grown in Ireland are produced for supply to the fresh retail market. It is expected that, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for &ldquo;<i>Reopening Society and Business&rdquo;, </i>demand will increase for potatoes in the catering and processing sectors also, and there is some evidence of this already<i>.</i></p><p>With regard to processing potatoes in particular, the industry has invested significantly over the years in storage facilities and other equipment that allowed for diversification into different markets.  This investment was supported by grant aid from my Department.  This capacity and diversity of markets allows for orderly processing and market access throughout the year.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that,<i></i>to address the particular challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government, in conjunction with relevant state agencies, has introduced a range of measures to aid businesses that may be suffering short term financial problems.

It was replaced in 2014 by &lsquo;<i>Forests, products and people: Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy &ndash; a renewed vision</i>&rsquo;. The strategic goal for the forestry sector in Ireland as described in <i>&ldquo;Forest products and people&quot; </i>is<i></i>as follows;<i></i></p><p><i>&ldquo;To develop an internationally competitive and sustainable forest sector that provides a full range of economic, environmental and social benefits to society and which accords with the Forest Europe definition of sustainable forest management&rdquo;</i></p><p>This policy document was a key driver in the development  of the measures contained in the Forestry Programme 2014 -2020. Since the commencement of the Programme to end 2019, a total of 26,000 hectares of new forests have been funded.  In addition, some 383,000m of forest road have been  supported and constructed.</p><p>In order to further respond to the policy direction in <i>&ldquo;Forest products and people&quot;, </i>a Mid-Term Review of the Forestry Programme was completed in 2018. The Department introduced innovations, including increased rates, to address reduced planting levels and to introduce greater diversity in terms of the species being planted. These have had a positive effect with, for example, broadleaf planting rising from 21% of all trees planted in 2017 to 36% to date this year.</p><p>Other new measures in terms of sustainable forest management and to support the delivery of public goods such as biodiversity were also introduced by the Department in 2019, on foot of the Mid-Term Review.  These were:</p><p>- The introduction of tree guards and deer fencing grants as part of a new &ldquo;Forest Fencing and Tree Shelter Scheme&rdquo; to reduce the risk of deer damage for existing broadleaf forests;</p><p>- Inclusion of a new Continuous Cover Forestry measure as part of the Woodland Improvement Scheme which will generate more diverse habitats for wildlife by creating forests with a more varied age structure. The objectives of the measures are <i>inter alia</i>to enhance environmental benefits of existing coniferous forests by opening up the canopy and creating new habitats for wildlife, to create an uneven canopy structure with the aim of producing high quality, high value logs and to promote a more suitable management option in sensitive sites; and</p><p>- A Woodland Improvement Scheme which supports thinning interventions for broadleaf forests and is designed to stimulate investment in the improvement, protection and development of young broadleaf forests. This activity fulfils a  range of functions, including the improvement in the quality of hardwoods being produced thereby increasing the value of the broadleaf forest for the owner. Thinning  also delivers ecosystem services such as increased biodiversity and climate adaption as a result of healthier trees which will have greater resilience to pest and disease outbreaks.</p><p>The MacKinnon review of my Department's procedures for licencing of forestry has recommended the development of a new national Forest Strategy as part of the preparation of a new National Forestry Programme. This will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.</p></reply>

This aid was granted to provide temporary market adjustment support in response to a specific market disturbance as outlined in Ireland's notification to the EU Commission.  As part of the notification and approval process for the measure,   the 5% reduction was part of the conditionality sought by the EU.   </p>  <p>  Approved BEAM participants have given a commitment to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on the holding by 5% for the period 01 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 as compared with the period 01 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 as recorded on Department systems.  Given that this requirement only begins from July 2020 and is reviewed across the duration of a year, it is not intended to amend this requirement.  In addition, it is also relevant that the most recent analysis of Nitrates trends in participating herds indicates that two thirds have already started to make adjustments to reduce their nitrates with almost half the participants meeting the 5% reduction already.</p>  <p>  Participants who need advice on how to manage this reduction can contact the Department or consult an agricultural advisor to work out which changes will make most sense on their farm.</p></reply>

On 22 May, confirmatory tests carried out at my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory verified the suspect case as Atypical BSE. Atypical BSE is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate and has only been identified in older cattle. There are no public health risks associated with this occurrence.</p>  <p>  My Department promptly notified relevant comptent authorities in importing countries, the EU Commission and the OIE (World Animal Health Organisation) of the test findings. Ireland is designated by the OIE as a country with a &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; risk status since 2008; this classification recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s BSE controls are effective and that, under OIE rules, Irish beef can be safely traded internationally. The discovery of a rare Atypical case does not affect Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;controlled risk&rsquo; status.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, on an interim basis and in line with the specific protocol agreed with the Chinese authorities, Ireland has voluntarily suspended beef exports to China, as and from 22 May, until an epidemiological report by DAFM on the occurrence is considered by the Chinese authorities. This report, which concludes that this case is consistent with the epidemiology of Atypical BSE and underlines the efficacy of our BSE surveillance system, has now submitted to the General Administration of Customs in China (GACC).  </p>  <p>  Beef exports to China have grown significantly in the short time that the market has been open. According to the latest data from the CSO, almost 8,200 tonnes of Irish beef worth approximately &euro;40m were shipped in 2019, the first full year the market was open. Shipments in the first quarter of 2020 amounted to some 2,200 tonnes and were worth approximately &euro;11m. </p>  <p>  My officials are engaging intensively with the Chinese authorities with a view to seeking an early resumption of the beef trade to China.

The funding is limited to 1% of the RDP budget.</p>  <p>  The proposal is still under negotiation in Brussels, and the agreement on the final legal text is still to be reached between the Council,  European Commission and the European Parliament. It provides only a very limited opportunity for Member States that are well advanced in their drawdown of Rural Development funding to avail of these measures.  Ireland is in the top two Member States in terms of execution of the Rural Development Programme, with over 84% of funding drawdown (EU average 60%), and the balance of the funding is either already committed or will be committed in 2020.  Therefore, it is not proposed to utilise this measure, as to do so would involve a reallocation of funding from current schemes (ANC, GLAS, Organics, etc.) within the existing Rural Development Programme.  This would have a further negative impact on those farms that may already be experiencing cashflow difficulties. </p>  <p>  I continue, of course, to press at a national and EU level to ensure that sufficient supports are put in place for primary producers and for the wider agri-food sector.  Most recently, I have brought forward payments on some RDP schemes, including &euro;26m in GLAS payments and balancing payments under the Organic Farming scheme. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves. </p></reply>

The most recent proposal for the CAP in that period brings funding levels to some &euro;375 billion (current prices), with a further special injection of rural development funds &ndash; of some &euro;16.5 billion - from the new Next Generation EU fund, bringing the total allocation to &euro;391 billion for the period 2021-2027.The budgetary proposals have been set out at overall EU-27 level.

The concept of external convergence is not new, and is continuing on from previous proposals.  The original Commission proposals of May 2018 propose that all Member States whose Direct Payments are below 90% of the EU average will see the process of external convergence continuing from the 2014 &ndash; 2020 period.</p><p>For those Member States with direct payments levels per hectare below 90% of the EU average, the process of external convergence will close the gap between their current level and 90% of the EU average by 50%<b>. </b>All Member States are contributing to the financial cost of external convergence of Direct Payments, and this is taken into account in Member States direct payments allocations in the draft regulation (COM (2018) 392) which are calculated on this basis. </p><p>The new proposal contains a number of new elements including a new Next Generation EU Recovery Fund.  Precise details are awaited on the latest proposals as to how all the elements will interact together and work in practice.

I have worked tirelessly with my European colleagues to successfully build a broad alliance to support the maintenance of the CAP budget for the next programming period.  </p>  <p>  Much of this has focused on the increased environmental ambition being asked of farmers as part of the CAP post-2020 proposals.  We cannot ask our farmers to do more for less.  The European Green Deal initiative and the recently published Farm to Fork and Biodiversity strategies set further climate and environmental targets that all sectors, including the agriculture sector, will have to achieve.  The CAP post-2020 will be the mechanism that the agriculture sector will use to deliver on these targets.</p>  <p>  In this context, I welcome the latest proposals from the European Commission of an increased CAP budget for the period 2021-2027 in the revised European Multiannual Financial Framework accompanying the new European Recovery Programme.  </p>  <p>  The new proposals represent a significant advance on the original Commission MFF proposal of May 2018.  The revised proposal for the CAP sees additional funding being added to bring funding levels to some &euro;375 billion (current prices), with a further special injection of rural development funds &ndash; of some &euro;16.5 billion - from the new Next Generation EU fund, bringing the total allocation to &euro;391 billion for the period 2021-2027.  </p>  <p>  The new MFF proposals will play an important role in supporting the economic recovery of Member States.

Ireland has pressed for the earliest possible adoption of these regulations, so that my Department may plan for the transitional period with legal and financial certainty and, consequently, provide clarity to farmers and rural communities as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Any extension to or replacement of schemes would be dependent on the appropriate budget being available, as well as sufficient time being available from the adoption of the legal framework to allow administrative provisions to be put in place.  The Department is currently considering these matters in the context of giving effect in due course to the transitional arrangements should they be adopted. </p>  <p>  As GLAS is a voluntary scheme, farmers will not be obliged to participate in any transitional arrangements which are put in place, once they have completed their existing five year contract.</p></reply>

The current expiry date of the approval is 31st October 2020.  It meets the exclusion criteria for the approval of active substances specified in the regulation but was approved on the basis of a socio-economic derogation provided for in the legislation.  Products containing creosote can only be authorised by Member States for use where it is concluded on the basis of a socio-economic analysis that no appropriate alternatives are available. A comparative assessment report of the uses authorised in Member States, including Ireland, was prepared in 2016 and was last updated in 2019. This report was prepared on the basis of extensive feedback from relevant stakeholders regarding the feasibility of using potential alternative products.</p>  <p>  Ireland has authorised creosote products for a small number of necessary uses, including the treatment of agricultural fencing by professional users.  Current alternatives are not viable replacements and have to be re-applied after a much shorter interval compared to creosote treatments. The suitability of any new alternative products currently in development will be considered in due course.</p>  <p>  The EU process for consideration of renewal of approval of creosote for use in wood preservative products is currently ongoing.  The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) launched a public consultation on creosote in 2019. This consultation was closed in December 2019 and over 80 submissions were received. These comments are available for viewing on the ECHA website. The EU Commission have proposed to extend the expiry date for the current approval of creosote until the 31 October 2021 in order to allow sufficient time for the examination of all relevant information by the evaluating competent authority and ECHA. </p>  <p>  Ireland will fully comply with any new product authorisation conditions that may be specified following this consultation process. </p></reply>

On 22 May, confirmatory tests carried out at my Department&rsquo;s Central Veterinary Research Laboratory verified the suspect case as Atypical BSE. Atypical BSE is believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate and has only been identified in older cattle. There are no public health risks associated with this occurrence.</p>  <p>  My Department promptly notified relevant competent authorities in importing countries, the EU Commission and the OIE (World Animal Health Organisation) of the test findings. Ireland is designated by the OIE as a country with a &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; risk status since 2008; this classification recognises that Ireland&rsquo;s BSE controls are effective and that, under OIE rules, Irish beef can be safely traded internationally. The discovery of a rare Atypical BSE case does not affect Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;controlled risk&rsquo; status.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, on an interim basis and in line with the specific protocol agreed with the Chinese authorities, Ireland has voluntarily suspended beef exports to China as and from 22 May, until an epidemiological report by DAFM on the occurrence is considered by the Chinese authorities. This report, which concludes that this case is consistent with the epidemiology of Atypical BSE and underlines the efficacy of our BSE surveillance system, has now submitted to the General Administration of Customs in China.  </p>  <p>  Beef exports to China have grown significantly in the short time that the market has been open. According to the latest data from the CSO, almost 8,200 tonnes of Irish beef worth approximately &euro;40m were shipped in 2019, the first full year the market was open. Shipments in the first quarter of 2020 amounted to some 2,200 tonnes and were worth approximately &euro;11m. </p>  <p>  My officials are engaging intensively with the Chinese authorities  with a view to seeking an early resumption of the beef trade to China.  The decision to resume trade is a matter for the Chinese authorities. </p></reply>

I have worked tirelessly with my European colleagues to successfully build a broad alliance to support the maintenance of the CAP budget for the next programming period.</p>  <p>  The new proposals represent a significant advance on the original Commission MFF proposal of May 2018.  The revised proposal for the CAP sees additional funding being added to bring funding levels to some &euro;375 billion (current prices), with a further special injection of rural development funds &ndash; of some &euro;16.5 billion - from the new Next Generation EU fund, bringing the total allocation to &euro;391 billion for the period 2021-2027, with some &euro;290 billion in Pillar I and &euro;101 billion in Pillar II.  The budgetary proposals have been set out at overall EU-27 level.    </p>  <p>  The new MFF proposals will play an important role in supporting the economic recovery of Member States.  However, these proposals are complex and my Department is examining them in detail so that we can fully understand the precise implications for our agri-food sector.  </p></reply>

Achievement of these targets will be supported by the financial allocation under Project Ireland 2040 of EUR 3.7 billion, and a range of other measures identified in the Climate Action Plan.  A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery model capable of achieving the above mentioned targets. Upgrading oil-fired and gas-fired heating systems to more efficient heat pumps is a core component of this new approach. The new retrofit delivery model will address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity and delivery structure.  The Taskforce is also working to determine the estimated cost of achieving our retrofit targets.</p><p>The Retrofit Taskforce report, which will include an estimate of the retrofit programme, is to be published in Q3 2020.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 140,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The Warmer Homes Scheme budget allocation for 2020 is &euro;52.8 million - a record level of funding for this scheme.   The Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. Recommendations on issues including repeat upgrade visits and how to best target those in need will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Although retrofit work under the scheme has been postponed in recent months due to COVID-19 related restrictions, the SEAI has continued to accept new applications and process payments for works completed.  SEAI will now engage directly with its panel of retrofit contractors providing services under the Warmer Homes Scheme, to agree a timeline, protocols and processes for resumption of works on homes which can be categorised as lower risk.  The SEAI hopes to conclude this process very speedily and recommence works within Phase 2 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  Notices on this scheme and other schemes administered by the SEAI can be found on their website (www.seai.ie/covid-19-notice).   </p></reply>

This additional funding will allow LEOs and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to approve additional vouchers to successful applicants.</p><p>The table below sets out the current position and is informed by the most up to date information received by my Department from the individual LEOs <table>    <tr>       <th>LEO</th>       <th>Allocation for 2020 as of January 2020</th>       <th>Allocation for 2020 as of 8 June 2020</th>       <th>Vouchers approved to 29 May 2020*</th>       <th>Completed applications not yet approved</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>367</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>154</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork N&amp;amp;W</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>340</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>52</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork South</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>345</td>       <td>47</td>       <td>110</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>255</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>101</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>335</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>113</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin DLR</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>430</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>160</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Fingal</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>615</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>260</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin South</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>540</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>250</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>215</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>90</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>354</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>140</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>113</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>279</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>   <tr>        <td>Limerick</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>290</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>153</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>75</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>235</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>42</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>390</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>112</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>235</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>148</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>45</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>205</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>92</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</td>       <td>n/a</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>n/a</td>       <td>n/a</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1000</td>       <td>7200</td>       <td>1635</td>       <td>2351</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Based on information received from the LEOs covering the period 16 March to 2 June the average value of vouchers approved is &euro;2,355</p></reply>

Premises within this intervention area will be served by the network to be deployed by NBI, as within this area commercial operators have advised my Department that they have no plans to deliver high speed broadband service. </font></p><p>There is no prohibition on commercial serving these premises. The Department has engaged extensively with industry since 2013 through multiple public consultations to determine as accurately as possible where commercial operators have existing High speed broadband networks and where they have plans over the next 7 years to deploy high speed broadband networks. The Department's High Speed Broadband Map ( available at broadband.gov.ie) <font color="#212121">shows the extent of</font>the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services as notified to the Department through these consultations by industry.</p><p><font color="#212121">  The NBP contract provides a mechanism for National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to apply for compensation for encroachment</font>in the event that <font color="#212121">other commercial operators have deployed a future proofed high speed broadband service, of a fibre or equivalent high speed broadband technology,  in advance of NBI's own deployment in the intervention area. This contingent subsidy can only be applied for in specific circumstances and is subject to robust governance mechanisms.  The encroachment element of the contingency subsidy is capped at &euro;100m and can only be applied for where the Department determines a commercial deployment of high speed broadband meets the requirements set out in the NBP contract, specifically a deployment of a fibre or equivalent high speed broadband technology, and that this deployment has had a negative impact on NBI's business case.  The consultation on the NBP map that was carried out in the second half of 2019 in advance of contract award, which established industry&rsquo;s up to date infrastructure and future plans, has significantly reduced the likelihood of the encroachment element of the contingency subsidy being sought.</font></p></reply>

As a first step, the purchase of certain single use plastics has been banned throughout the public service. We are committed to increase recycling rates of plastics from 34% now to 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030, along with other EU member states, and to phase out non-recyclable plastics entirely. A Deposit and Return Scheme is one option proposed for EU member states to consider as a means of increasing the collection of plastic beverage containers and achieve the new 90% target for this waste stream identified in the Single Use Plastic Directive.  In 2019 I commissioned a study to examine how Ireland can deliver a 90% collection target for single use beverage containers, including plastic bottles, as required under the Single Use Plastics Directive. This study examines the possibility of introducing a Deposit and Return Scheme and how this might operate in an Irish context.  The introduction of an initiative such as a Deposit and Return Scheme needs to be carefully considered in the context of potential benefits, expected costs and impacts identified to enable evidence-based decision making in this matter and having regard to other potential measures that would facilitate the 90% collection rate. The study into how Ireland can achieve the 90% collection target has been received and is currently being reviewed in the context of developing a new Waste Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme was also considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment in 2018. The estimated set up and running costs were identified as between &euro;76m to &euro;116m net cost, without consideration of the impacts on the existing kerbside collection and existing household subsidy.</p></reply>

Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone. </p>  <p>  I announced in December 2019 that the ban will be extended to 13 further urban centres with populations in excess of 10,000 people with effect from September 2020 onwards. Consultation continues with the relevant Local Authorities in order to define the exact geographical areas in which the ban will apply, and my Department is currently drafting the necessary secondary legislation.</p>  <p>  The decision to make only a partial extension to the existing ban at this time was made in the  context where a number of coal firms had indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide. </p>  <p>  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these products produce similar levels of pollution. The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban relating to bituminous coal. The legal threat remains though no legal proceedings have been initiated since my announcement in December 2019.  The Attorney General has provided legal advice on this matter, and my officials are continuing to engage with his office to finalise a legally robust plan, which will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardising the existing ban. </p>  <p>  I am already on record as welcoming the EPA report &ldquo;Air Quality in Ireland 2018&rdquo;, published late last year, which sets out the current position as regards our air quality and illustrates certain challenges in this regard. It is important to note that the report indicates that air quality levels at monitoring sites in Ireland were below the current EU legislative limit values in 2018.   </p>  <p>  The principal responsibility for enforcing the ban rests with individual Local Authorities. Therefore, I have not met with, the Department of Health in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities are responsible for carrying out of their statutory functions, including enforcement., and the deployment of resources to meet priorities locally.  It at the discretion each Local Authority, where necessary, to seek additional resources for particular priorities through the normal estimates negotiations process.</p></reply>

EU Directive 2302/2015 on Package Travel requires travel agents and tour operators to provide a full cash refund within 14 days in the event that a package holiday is cancelled, by either the customer or the holiday provider, in the case of unavoidable or extraordinary circumstances such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have issued the following updated guidance on the right of travellers to terminate package travel into the summer months: </p><p>Where customers of travel agents and/or tour operators are not receiving requested refunds, they have recourse to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the State's consumer watchdog, for advice.</p><p>I am conscious that meeting the refund obligations of the EU Package Travel Directive is putting incredible financial strain on travel agents and tour operators.  For that reason, the Government has approved special support measures in the form of a State-guaranteed Refund Credit Note, which can be offered instead of cash refunds in the secure knowledge that their value is underwritten by the State.  The idea behind the Refund Credit Note is that the tour operators/travel agents may offer customers the option of the Note, which can then be used to book a future holiday or redeemed for cash at a later date.  Importantly the customer may still opt for a cash refund.</p></reply>

The NTA&rsquo;s technical and financial support will be funded by my Department&rsquo;s sustainable mobility investment programme and will support delivery of measures such as:</p>  <p>  - widening of footpaths to facilitate queuing outside shops and enable social distancing</p>  <p>  - potential pedestrianisation of some streets where necessary and feasible to accommodate social distancing, particularly where this supports business activities</p>  <p>  - potential one-way systems to create space for footpath widening</p>  <p>  - altering traffic signal times to reduce pedestrian waiting/crowding plus the automatic activation of some pedestrian phases in order to aid pedestrian movement and to minimise contact with signal push buttons</p>  <p>  - providing additional temporary facilities for cyclists</p>  <p>  - provision of some external space where appropriate to support business activities</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging directly with PSO and commercial operators to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we progress through the various phases of the Roadmap.  My Department is also engaged intensively across Government in relation to progressing relevant issues.  In view of these necessary approaches and engagements to address what is already a complex and difficult set of issues, I have no plans, at this time, to establish an additional administrative structure.</p></reply>

It also includes a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical, or partly electrical and partly mechanical.</p>  <p>  Escooters and powered skateboards fall into this category, and are therefore considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles.  Any users of such vehicles in a public place (as defined in the Road Traffic Act 1961) must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, with penalties under road traffic laws (including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle) for not being in compliance with these requirements.  </p>  <p>  As it is currently not possible to tax or insure escooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place.</p>  <p>  Electric bicycles are in a different category to eScooters.  Where a bicycle has an electric motor attached which may be used as an alternate means of propulsion, the vehicle is defined as a mechanically propelled vehicle under the Road Traffic Acts whether or not the motor is being used.  However, under Article 1 (h) of EU Directive 2002/24/EC E-bikes are defined as &ldquo;cycles with pedal assistance which are equipped with an auxiliary electric motor having a maximum continuous rated power of 0.25 kW, of which the output is progressively reduced and finally cut off as the vehicle reaches a speed of 25 km/h, or sooner, if the cyclist stops pedalling&rdquo;.  As bikes of this type require continuous effort on the part of the cyclist, they are considered to be pedal cycles &ndash; in other words, the engine is not the means of propulsion, but an aid to the user.</p>  <p>  Pedal assisted cycles with a maximum continuous rated power of more than 0.25 kW and E-bikes that can be exclusively propelled by the motor are classified in the Directive as low-performance mopeds, i.e. vehicles with pedals, with an auxiliary engine of power not exceeding 1 kW and a maximum design speed not exceeding 25 km/h.  Such vehicles are subject to Road Traffic legislation as outlined above, with the user obliged to have tax, insurance and an appropriate driving licence where the vehicle is to be used in a public place.</p>  <p>  In the current context, in several jurisdictions it has been noted that there were significant increases in demand on accident and emergency medical facilities due to the use of other Powered Personal Transporters (PPTs), such as electric scooters. This would not be advisable here given the ongoing demands on our health service due to the Covid 19 pandemic and so any change that may create such additional demands would also have to be subject to consideration from that wider public health viewpoint. </p></reply>

The services are suspended in the interests of public health and safety, which must always be our highest priorities.  </p>  <p>  During the period of the viral outbreak, the RSA has provided limited tests, on an emergency basis, in the C and D licence categories, that is buses and trucks.  The Authority explored the possibility of providing emergency category B - car - driving tests, but found that this would be impossible in light of the current health-based restrictions.  </p>  <p>  Neither my colleague the Minister for Health nor the Health Services Executive have raised any issues with me regarding healthcare workers and the suspension of driving tests by the RSA.  In the event that such issues were to be identified as of concern to those responsible for the health services, I would of course engage with the responsible authorities.  It would have been an inappropriate imposition on the Minister for Health's time - in the midst of the first global pandemic in the history of the State - for me to seek to discuss with him matters which had not been identified as impacting on health services, such as the suspension of a service based on unambiguous health advice.   </p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.

As a private company, a driving school must ensure that they can comply with the necessary public health requirements before they can reopen their businesses. The National Return to Work Safely Protocol was developed by NPHET in consultation with national experts.</p>  <p>  Driver instruction is likely to resume in line with driver testing, however, and I expect a driving school to encounter the same difficulties as the Road Safety Authority (RSA) in terms of complying with the requirements of this Protocol.  The resumption of both driver testing  and driver instruction raise particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as both scenarios require the learner and either the tester or instructor to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes. To put this in perspective, on a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap. </p>  <p>  I understand that any company which reopens is subject to inspection by Health and Safety Authority, and may face serious sanctions, including closure, if found to be not in compliance with Covid-19 requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that driving tests in Northern Ireland operates under UK law.  As such, it differs from that in this jurisdiction, and as a consequence so does driving instruction.  Approved Driving Instructors are only registered by the Road Safety Authority in respect of Ireland.  To that extent, driving instructors would not normally work in both jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Northern Ireland Executive published last month its own Approach to Decision-Making with its own five steps, which may apply at different times across different sectors. I understand that it states that decisions on the future approach to the restrictions are for the Executive to take based on the best analysis of the situation there and internationally.  It is anticipated that the approach to be taken as the restrictions are relaxed will continue to be based on common principles across these islands, although there may be times when there are nuanced differences of approach as a result of the circumstances in differing jurisdictions or of the timing of decision-making.  </p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

The Department of Health, the HSE and the HPRA have been working closely on mitigating risks to the supply of medicines and medical devices in various scenarios including Brexit and Covid-19.  In that regard, I was happy to assist by meeting all the shipping companies in October 2019 and putting in place with them an arrangement that the transportation of key time-sensitive medicines and medical items as required by the HSE in a Brexit context would be prioritised by them.  I had this arrangement extended by my Department in consultation with the shipping companies to cover the Covid-19 situation in March 2020.</p>  <p>  Regardless of the outcome of the current EU &ndash;UK negotiations, the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period, currently due on 31 December 2020, will see the UK no longer applying the rules of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union.  This will bring substantial challenges for supply chains and trade flows and will require checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade.  These additional requirements are expected to have an impact on the UK landbridge which is a  strategically important route to market for many sectors including for medicines and medical supplies.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the UK landbridge, my Department and the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) have had ongoing liaisons with the ferry companies in planning for the implications of Brexit last year and earlier this year. The ferry companies were confident that they could respond to increased capacity demands on direct services to continental EU ports should the demand arise. This was of considerable assurance to my Department at that time. </p>  <p>  COVID 19 has delivered an unprecedented shock to the whole of the Irish economy and to the shipping sector with a significant decline in passenger numbers travelling by sea. Freight has also been affected with substantial declines on some routes.  My Department has been working through various channels to assist ports and shipping companies to keep the supply chains operating during this crisis. In particular, the Department has prioritised the issues of maritime connectivity at all stages to assist shipping with a range of practical supports.  I am confident that these measures will support these vital transportation services during COVID 19 leaving the industry well placed to provide sufficient freight and passenger capacity, including for the medicines and pharmaceutical export sector, when the UK's transitional period ends.  </p></reply>

Nonetheless, public transport has served, and will continue to serve, a vital role in transporting essential workers and in supporting Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  Public health advices on social distancing are relevant across the public transport sector, and operators are implementing measures to facilitate adequate social distancing measures on-board; this significantly reduces the carrying capacity of public transport services. </p>  <p>  While the majority of public transport in Ireland is provided by the publicly-subvented bus and rail services funded through National Transport Authority's (NTA) public service obligation (PSO) programme, the public transport system also includes non-subvented bus services provided on a commercial basis by bus and coach businesses of varying size.  I understand that about 90% of the commercial bus operators have suspended their services or are providing significantly reduced services at present.</p>  <p>  From my Department's engagement with their representatives, and indeed from the NTA's regular engagement with them throughout the crisis, I understand the very difficult business environment that the commercial bus operators are now dealing with.  Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  That is why we have worked to introduce a wide programme of Government supports for impacted businesses.  The range of supports available includes new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation about these matters and am raising with her the concerns and situation of the commercial operators. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to engage with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland on a regular basis. Furthermore, a reply has issued directly to the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland in respect of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is an independent statutory body, funded through the Vote of the DTTAS.</p><p>The function of the MCIB, per section 7 of the Act,<i></i>is to carry out investigations and publish reports into marine casualties that take place in connection with the operation of a vessel in Irish waters or involve Irish registered vessels anywhere in the world.</p><p>The purpose of the MCIB&rsquo;s investigations is to establish the cause or causes of a marine casualty with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar marine casualties.  It is not the purpose of an investigation to attribute blame or fault, per Section 25(2) of the Act.</p><p>All investigations of casualties are carried out by the MCIB&rsquo;s panel of external investigators. The panel consists of personnel holding technical qualifications as naval architects, marine engineers or deck officers. The panel reflects broad based maritime competence and experience which are of relevance in undertaking independent investigations. </p><p>Safety investigations are conducted with the sole objective of preventing marine incidents in the future and they are not designed to determine liability or to apportion blame. Where appropriate the MCIB suggests safety recommendations (i.e. proposals for remedial actions to prevent future marine casualties and incidents). These recommendations may be directed to my Department or to any other parties that might be best placed to implement such measures (e.g. a Port or Harbour Authority, a vessel owner or ship management company, etc.). </p><p>Some safety recommendations lend themselves to early implementation upon consultation with the Marine Survey Office, which is based in my Department and has primary responsibility for the regulation and enforcement of the maritime safety sector, including ship and port security. For example, my Department may issue Marine Notices in order to bring particular safety information or advice to the attention of the maritime sector and the wider sea-going public.  In other cases, recommendations are complex and require detailed assessment, consultation with interested parties and, in some instances, the introduction of new or amending legislation. </p><p>Other safety recommendations may also suggest amendments to DTTAS safety publications, such as the Code of Practice for Fishing Vessels less than 15 metres in length overall, the Code of Practice for the Safe Operation of Recreational Craft or implementation of an action under the Maritime Safety Strategy.  Such recommendations are recorded in my Department and the amendments are taken under consideration by officials for inclusion during the next revision of the documents. </p><p>Additionally, my Department maintains a database of MCIB Reports, the safety recommendations contained in those reports and any follow up required. </p><p>Finally, where the MCIB makes a safety recommendation to a private party, it is a matter for that entity to review the recommendation(s) and take the necessary follow up actions.</p></reply>

The NPHET oversees and provides national direction on the development and implementation of the strategy to contain COVID-19 in Ireland and the measures to protect public health. The Department of Health is responsible for the development of the policy proposal concerning possible restriction measures, following the recently implemented passenger location card requirement for the voluntary self-isolation of incoming travellers to Ireland.   </p>  <p>  At present, airports are following public health measures as advised, such as, social distancing, disinfection procedures, passenger announcements and airport notices on hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Guidance has also been provided concerning alternative measures for aviation security screening of passengers which ensure that both health safety and aviation security standards are maintained during this time.  </p>  <p>  On 20 May the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control jointly published guidance on measures to assure the health safety of air travellers and aviation personnel once airlines resume regular flight schedules. My Department, through the National Facilitation Committee is coordinating the implementation of these measures by industry, aimed at promoting health safety and virus control throughout the aviation journey, with due regard to the maintenance of aviation safety and security standards. I expect that a National Code of Practice in this regard will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The European guidance for safe passenger management in air transport represents merely one element within a broader EU proposal for a common approach to future lifting of border restrictions published by the European Commission on the 13 May 2020, which is subject to the epidemiological circumstances and the response of the Public Health Authorities in each individual Member State. </p></reply>

Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible. </p>  <p>  However, there are legacy issues in relation to older infrastructure and facilities, for example our Victorian era railway stations. To address these infrastructural legacy issues, my Department funds the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme which is managed by the NTA. The four year capital envelope for public transport announced in Budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost &euro;28m for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme for the period 2018 to 2021. The allocations for 2020 and 2021 are &euro;7 million and &euro;9.8 million respectively. The &euro;28 million in funding is a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the Capital Plan. </p>  <p>  This funding facilitates the continued roll-out of the programmes to progressively make public transport accessible, including the installation of accessible bus stops, the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and the provision of grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) into the taxi fleet.</p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027, sets out the national vision and ambition for the delivery of key infrastructure over the lifetime of the Plan, including in relation to public transport infrastructure. Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. A number of key new major public transport programmes are due to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027. </p>  <p>  As I expalined above, these programmes, as with all new and recently developed public transport projects, will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. There will also be a continued investment programme under the NDP to fund the retro-fitting of older public transport facilities to enhance accessibility. </p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  I understand, however, that the current practice of the two main Irish airlines serving the Irish market in instances where flights are not cancelled, and having regard to the Covid-19 travel restrictions, is to offer their customers the opportunity to rebook a flight for later in the year or to receive a voucher.  In some instances airlines are waiving charges on rebooking and offering additional incentives such as extra value on vouchers. </p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.  </p>  <p>  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I have raised directly with the two main Irish airlines.  I have asked that they take a fresh look at their current offerings to customers, that they bring more clarity to the messaging around entitlements and information on refund timeframes, and that they show discretion in favour of customers whose circumstances clearly make it unreasonable to expect them to travel, even if flights go. In looking to the future recovery, seeking ways to rebuild consumer confidence will be integral to initiating and indeed sustaining any future recovery for all parts of the aviation sector including the airlines. </p></reply>

The Exchequer allocates funding for the purposes of both capital and current expenditure from the Department's Vote to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for allocation to the transport operators for the provision of public transport services and infrastructure.  In Budget 2020, I secured an overall allocation of &euro;1 billion to fund public and sustainable transport projects this year.</p><p>Since 2010, the award of Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding falls under the independent statutory remit of the NTA.  The allocations to the companies are decided by the NTA in exercise of its statutory mandate and in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.  </p><p>It should be noted that the sharp decline in passenger numbers since mid-March this year as a result of the Covid-19 health emergency has caused an unprecedented fall in fare revenues, thus creating a wide gap between the operators' costs and actual revenues. This is putting acute pressure on the existing Public Service Obligation (PSO) budget. However, it is clear that public transport is an essential service and that it is an important facilitator of the Government's <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  </i>Therefore, I have been clear that we will ensure that this year's PSO is appropriately funded.  To that end, my Department is working closely with the NTA to quantify the additional funding requirements for the coming months, and we had very positive engagement across Government about the matter. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy's query about the allocation for PSO public transport services for future years, that will be subject to the annual Budgetary process and therefore the allocations for 2021 and beyond are yet to be determined in the context of future Estimates processes.</p><p>In relation to infrastructure, as the Deputy is aware, the <i>Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract</i>(or IMMAC) provides the funding framework for the maintenance and renewal of our railway infrastructure and is a statutory contractual agreement between the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The IMMAC allocations for 2020 and 2021 are &euro;199.7m. and &euro;202.5m. respectively, and the provisions for the past 5 years are set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>        2015   </div></th>       <th><div>              2016   </div></th>       <th><div>   2017   </div></th>       <th><div>             2018   </div></th>       <th><div>            2019   </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>    &euro;144m</div></td>       <td><div>           &euro;134m      *</div></td>       <td><div>&euro;159m</div></td>       <td><div>         &euro;160m</div></td>       <td><div>      &euro;197m</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*included extra &euro;8m for storm damage under IMMAC.</p><p>Separately, Exchequer capital funding is also provided to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann through the NTA.  This programme supports projects such as the continued planning and design of the DART Expansion Programme, the City Centre (rail) Resignalling Project, the replacement of the roof at Pearse Station, the development of the new National Train Control Centre, bus fleet purchases and various other enhancement projects. This funding programme is managed by the NTA, </p><p>In view of the above I have referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply. Please inform my private office if you do you receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

Next Decade is a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) development company which is focused on LNG export projects. </p>  <p>  Next Decade propose to import LNG through a FSRU (Floating Storage and Regasification Unit) which acts as a floating storage LNG terminal which will be moored permanently in the harbour. A new FRSU will most likely be commissioned and built for this purpose. </p>  <p>  Next Decade and the POCC have had preliminary meetings with the relevant Departments and stakeholders. They have met with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) and Gas Networks Ireland (GNI).  DCCAE and GNI indicated they are supportive of the project which will feed gas into the national pipeline located beside the proposed site of the new facility. This would give security of gas supply nationally into the long term and in the context of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  It is also planned that the FRSU facility would be able to provide an LNG refuelling and bunkering facility for ships at the Port of Cork, which would meet the requirement under the EC Alternative Fuels Directive for TEN-T ports. This facility would also be able to provide competitive bunkering to all Irish ports.  </p>  <p>  A feasibility study is currently being undertaken by Next Decade on where the vessel should be moored and environmental and regulatory matters are being examined. The site chosen will most likely be near the Whitegate refinery, with Bord Gais and the ESB facilities already located in the port. The development will be subject to all the normal planning requirements and compliance with all necessary consents. The proposed project falls under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  I understand that the project has not progressed at the pace the Port of Cork Company originally envisaged. One of the factors for the delay is the worldwide economic climate and in particular the drop in oil prices internationally. The Port of Cork Company advise that the project remains at a very preliminary stage and the Memorandum of Understanding expires at the end of this year. </p></reply>

A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies. Four meetings of this Group have been held to date. The Football Association of Ireland has participated in all of these meetings. A further meeting is planned for today, the 9th of June. Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis in relation to the development of protocols to facilitate a safe return to training and competition.</p>  <p>  This extensive engagement with the sport sector has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 and the importance of implementing an appropriate and focused response to the challenges facing all strands of the sector, ranging from the local sporting organisations and clubs to the National Governing Bodies and national leagues and competitions such as those involving League of Ireland clubs. It is accordingly intended to develop a Sport Recovery Action Plan, in consultation with the sector, aimed at minimising the impacts and preparing the sector to restart activity, as part of the national recovery and renewal.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to see the resumption of training by four League of Ireland clubs yesterday following the Government's decision last Friday to permit a limited return to training for elite athletes and teams. I understand it has been very difficult for all the players and coaching staff since the League of Ireland fixtures were suspended on 12 March. I am hopeful that we will see a return to competitive matches behind closed doors next month followed by the full resumption of the 2020 season later in the year.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, I am aware that the Taskforce has already made some suggestions for the re-opening of tourism and, along with my colleagues in Government, I have taken note of these and will consider any other interim recommendations as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce is made up of an independent chairperson and 13 other members from a broad spectrum of backgrounds including tourism policy, tourism enterprise, international, private and public service. The Minister of State and I selected members on the basis of each person's capacity to bring his/her personal knowledge, skills, experience, competence, capability, strategic leadership and ideas to the work of the group. We have appointed individuals who, together, will work for the good of Irish Tourism as a whole. The full list of membership is available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

Funding under CEF is delivered in the form of grants awarded following competitive calls for proposals. The amount of co-funding awarded varies depending on the criteria for each call, the type of project and the quality of applications. All applications will be assessed and evaluated by the European Commission in conjunction with independent external experts.</p><p>The most recent call for proposals was open for applications between 16 October 2019 and 26 February 2020. The call had an indicative budget of &euro;1.4 billion, with &euro;750 million available under the general financial envelope, which was open to all Member States. The balance of &euro;650 million was only open to Member States eligible for Cohesion Fund support, which does not include Ireland. </p><p>- The call had various budget lines dedicated to the following funding priorities: </p><p>- Pre-identified projects on the Core Network;</p><p>- European Rail Traffic Management Systems (ERTMS): on-board deployment;</p><p>- Safe and secure infrastructure, including safe and secure parking on the road core network;</p><p>- Intelligent Transport Services for road (ITS);</p><p>- Single European Sky (SESAR);</p><p>- Actions implementing transport infrastructure in nodes of the core network, including urban nodes (passengers transport); and</p><p>- Motorways of the Sea. </p><p>There were 9 projects in total either submitted by or involving participating Irish applicants, all of which were endorsed and signed off by my Department.</p><p>3 of the applications under this call, relating to the rail sector, and details of which are set out below, were submitted directly by my Department. Two of these were prepared in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>1. <i>DART Expansion Programme: Kildare Line Study</i>My Department is seeking 50% CEF co-funding for an engineering design study as part of the DART Expansion Programme. This study concerns the development of the Kildare Line, one of seven Work Packages in the Programme, and consists of crucial steps necessary in advance of moving to the construction phase of this project. </p><p>2. <i>Upgrade of the DART Passenger Information System</i>A separate application concerns the upgrading of the Passenger Information System on the existing DART fleet. This upgrade is necessary in order to ensure that the latest technology, which will be part of all newly procured DART rolling stock, is experienced by passengers across the entire DART fleet. As this is classified under CEF as a works project, my Department is seeking the maximum co-funding rate available of 30%.</p><p>3. <i>Higher Speed Rail Study </i>The final application submitted by my Department, a rail study project seeking 50% co-funding, addresses a commitment in the National Development Plan to undertake an evaluation of the economic benefits of high-speed rail between Dublin-Belfast, Dublin-Limerick Junction, and Dublin-Cork against the improvements to existing line speeds. The purpose of this study is to develop a design concept for the inter-urban railway network over the period to 2040 that can inform future investment in infrastructure, railway operations and planning.</p><p>Aside from those submitted directly by my Department, a further 3 projects were submitted by Ireland&rsquo;s three core TEN-T maritime ports: Dublin, Cork, and Shannon-Foynes, while a further 2 projects involve the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) and are study projects involving multiple Member States addressing alternative fuels, energy and technology funding objectives the Motorways of the Sea priority.</p><p>In addition to this, a number of Irish aviation bodies are involved, in an administrative capacity only, in a CEF application for funding under the EU&rsquo;S SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research) collaborative project.</p><p>The selection decision of successful projects is expected to be finalised in July 2020. Based on the quality of proposals made I am confident and hopeful that Irish applicants will draw down significant funds from this call. However, the oversubscription rate for funding under the general envelope of this call was approximately 2.4 : 1, highlighting the competitive nature of this funding opportunity.</p><p>Over the period 2014 to June 2019, Irish beneficiaries were participating in 24 projects<b></b>involving &euro;103 million in CEF Transport co-funding, and with overall investments in these projects of &euro;403.7 million. My Department continues to actively encourage  and engage with any potential CEF applicants to ensure a strong pipeline of Irish applications for future CEF funding opportunities. Further information about CEF, TEN-T and the application process are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p> </p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of childcare sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) was launched on April 15th.</p>  <p>  The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; </p>  <p>  - and to give Early Learning and Care Educators security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this, the Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme provides funding towards a portion of staff wages and services' overhead costs. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by childcare providers.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of robust oversight of Exchequer funding. This includes ensuring that funds provided under the TWSCS are used for purposes intended: to meet employee pay costs in conjunction with the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and to meet ongoing overhead costs. Where the funding provided is not used for these purposes, it may be appropriate to recoup.  Extensive information on the use of this funding has been provided to the sector, so that it can be used to meet services' costs effectively. My Department will take a reasonable and supportive approach to assessing the use of funding provided to services in this difficult time.</p>  <p>  The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the childcare sector. Further supports and funding are available from my Department including the Programme Support Payment, which will be paid to eligible services in June. Services may also be eligible for the Restart Grant for Small Business, administered by Local Authorities, and for other supports from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  I would also note there are supports available to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available to services which may still be facing regular challenges on top of the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. </p></reply>

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives. Childminders may also resume caring for children in the childminder&rsquo;s home from 29 June.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap proposes that the reopening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools in a phased manner will begin in Phase 3, which is currently scheduled to begin on 29 June. On 29 May, I announced which children would be eligible to resume full or part-time childcare services from 29 June. Whilst initially the Government Roadmap had indicated that services would resume only for the children of essential workers, this has now been widened.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, as these are private businesses, the allocation of places within the widened eligibility criteria is a matter for the individual service provider. My Department is providing guidance to help support providers in managing allocation of places when services reopen. </p>  <p>  In the best interests of the child and parents, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the childcare service they attended Pre-Covid19. It is also a contractual requirement of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme that services should retain places for children who used them pre-Covid 19. </p>  <p>  If a service has additional capacity they may register new families who have not previously used the setting, either on a long-term or a short-term basis depending on the service's capacity. </p>  <p>  Subject to local capacity, from 29 June services are encouraged to also support: </p>  <p>  - children of health and social care workers, other frontline workers, childcare practitioners and parents who need access to childcare in order to return to work;</p>  <p>  - vulnerable children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) (for example, children whose families are homeless and Tusla referrals) and children funded through legacy childcare schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues; and</p>  <p>  - children with disabilities who previously attended part or full-time early learning and care, including those preparing to start school in September.</p>  <p>  Service providers and parents are encouraged to make early contact with each other so that the level of demand and supply for places from 29 June can be known.  </p>  <p>  Childminders and nannies have been able to continue working in the homes of essential workers throughout the pandemic period. From 29 June, childminders will also be able to return to working in the childminder's home. There are an estimated 15,000 childminders. </p></reply>

The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. Based on advice provided by the HPSC I do not propose to change Regulations in relation to either the adult-child ratios or the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services as such changes are unnecessary where "play pods" are in use.</p>  <p>  Services are now being asked to apply the guidance to their setting and determine what capacity they may offer. It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services that reopen in the summer, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability.  Whilst there are 4,500 Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services in the country, fewer than 2,000 of these normally remain open in July and August.</p></reply>

The EY Forum meets several times a year and includes representatives of providers, parents and academics with an interest in the ELC and SAC sector.  I established the &lsquo;EY Forum Plus&rsquo; in March 2020 to widen representation by the sector, to aid my Department in developing a response to Covid-19.  This group has met on a number of occasions over the past three months. </p>  <p>  I recently established an Advisory Group and a Reference Group on the phased re-opening of ELC and SAC services on 29 June 2020. The Advisory Group had its first meeting on 13 May and has met 4 times since. A separate Reference Group representing other stakeholders had its first meeting on 28 May.</p>  <p>  In establishing the Advisory Group on the phased reopening of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare sector, I provided six places for sectoral representatives, to be filled by members of the Forum Plus group. The sector itself decided on the nominees and these include representatives from the Association of Childhood Professionals, PL&Eacute;, Seas Suas, Early Childhood Ireland, the National Childhood Network and the National Community Forum. </p>  <p>  I added Childminding Ireland and SIPTU as members of the group, as they represent key parts of the early years sector not included in the list above, i.e. childcare staff and childminders.  Pobal and Tusla are also members of the Advisory Group. I chair the meetings of the group and we have met on five occasions since 13 May 2020.</p>  <p>  A number of additional provider representative groups contacted my Department seeking to be added to the membership of the Advisory Group.  In response to such requests, I established a Reference Group, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group. The Reference Group includes representatives from the Federation of Early Childhood, the Association of Full-time Day Care Providers, St Nicholas Montessori and a number of service providers.  I chaired the first meeting of the Reference Group on 28 May.</p></reply>

Educational Welfare Officers (EWO's) work with families and children to overcome barriers to their school attendance, participation and retention.</p>  <p>  TESS has advised the estimate cost of recruiting 40 extra full-time Educational Welfare Officers (EWO) for TESS would be in the region of &euro;2,763,964.00. The overall cost may vary depending on what point of the Educational Welfare Officer salary scale each individual EWO starts on. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for a strong policy platform for the services delivered by TESS, my Department established a Task Group to support the further development and integration of these services. The work of this group is near completion and a clear blueprint for the development of the three strands of the TESS, including the statutory Educational Welfare Service (EWS) is expected to be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of childcare sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSCS) on 15 April. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; </p>  <p>  - and to give Early Learning and Care Educators security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this, the Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme provides funding towards a portion of staff wages and services' ongoing overhead costs for the period of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of robust oversight of Exchequer funding and ensuring that it is spent on the purposes it was intended for, and information has been provided to the sector on the appropriate use of this funding. My Department also recognises the need to be supportive of providers; hence, payments made by beneficiaries using the overhead funding within four weeks of the end of the scheme may also be deemed eligible alongside payments made during the period of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The TWSCS is one of a range of supports available to the sector from my Department and from across Government. Further supports and funding are available from my Department including the Programme Support Payment for the 2019/20 Programme year which will issue in June this year, providing further income for services who apply. A new Capital Programme to support services to re-open will be available shortly. Services may also be eligible for the Restart Grant for Small Businesses, administered by Local Authorities, and other supports available from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  I would also note there are supports available to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available to services which may still be facing regular challenges on top of the difficulties imposed by the pandemic.</p></reply>

The CCCs were assigned by the National Childcare Strategy (2000) as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality childcare and to advance the provision of childcare facilities in their local areas.</p><p>The role of the CCCs is to provide support and guidance to local service providers and parents in relation to the various childcare programmes, and support quality in keeping with national frameworks and policy objectives.

The role of the CCCs during the Covid &ndash; 19 emergency is to continue to provide support and offer guidance and advice to services and parents in whatever way is necessary throughout this difficult period.  CCCs will play a key role in providing a range of supports to the early learning and care (ELC) and school age childcare (SAC) sector.

Currently, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap sees Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services, and childminders, opening in phase 3 (29 June).</p>  <p>  During this time of extended closure, a small number of services that have indicated their intention to close permanently are being tracked by Pobal&rsquo;s Case Management team and forwarded to the relevant officials in the Department. In the majority of these cases, the decision to close is unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pobal Case Management team are working with Local CCCs to support these services in exploring alternative solutions where possible. However, the final decision on whether a service will close lies with the owner/operator of the service. Where closure is unavoidable, Pobal and the local CCCs will support services with managing an orderly closure and offer assistance to parents with finding alternative ELC/SAC services.  </p>  <p>  The provision of places within an area is knowledge which is retained by the Local CCC. When a service enters a Case Management process, one of the first pieces of information the Local CCC will gather is an assessment of the available places within the area. </p>  <p>  Any service that is considering closure should notify their Local CCC immediately so that support can be provided and local capacity for childcare places can be assessed.</p>  <p>  A number of supports were available before COVID to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available now. Financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic. Again, all services who require support should contact their local CCC.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement and coincides with the school year. </p><p>Following the announcement of the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, by the Taoiseach on 12<sup>th</sup>March 2020, schools and organisations participating in the school meals programme expressed concerns about the impact of school closures on pupils who avail of school meals, and that the unavailability of school meals impacts in particular on the most disadvantaged in our society. </p><p>My Department confirmed that funding to schools would continue to enable schools provide food until the end of the current school year - the end of May for post-primary schools and the end of June for primary schools, in line with the parameters of the school meals scheme. </p><p>Any Primary School whose funding does not cover the provision of meals to the end of June should contact the school meals section at school.meals@welfare.ie and funding will be reviewed on a case by case basis.</p><p>Any proposals to consider a new scheme or extend funding for food provision beyond these dates would need to be considered in the overall budgetary context.  Furthermore, it is important to take account of the logistical issues involved in delivering the programme during the school holidays.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

The times at which annual leave is granted is ultimately determined by the employer, having regard to work requirements and subject to the employer taking into account the need for the employee to reconcile work and family responsibilities, the need for rest and recreation, and the employer having consulted the employee or a trade union (if any), not later than one month before the day on which the annual leave is due to commence. </p><p>Section 19 of the Act provides that an employee shall be entitled to paid annual leave equal to:</p> <blockquote> 	  	- 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment)<br /><br />- One-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 177 hours, or <br /><br />- 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).  </blockquote>  <p>As set out above, an entitlement to annual leave arises under the Act on the basis of hours worked, with the exception of sick leave.  Therefore, by definition, a person must be in employment to accrue annual leave. </p><p>It should be noted that the Act further provides that nothing prevents employers and employees from entering into arrangements that are more favourable to the employee with regard to the times of, and the pay in respect of, his or her annual leave. </p><p>I note that the Deputy states that the employees in question are not working.  While I am unsure of the details in this particular case, I am advised that it is only possible to negotiate annual leave arrangements, in accordance with the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 set out above, where an employment relationship has been maintained. </p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The payment is for a limited period and at a rate of &euro;350 to ensure that the person can comply with medical advice to isolate. </p>  <p>  Employees who cocoon without a medical certificate may approach their employer in relation to taking annual or other paid leave - this is at the discretion of the employer.  Many employers can, and do, agree leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to alter shift patterns, to work-up time taken, or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.  The government has encouraged employers to support workers with leave requests at this difficult time and those with underlying health conditions should be facilitated where possible.</p>  <p>  Where an employee is unable to return to the workplace as they are medically vulnerable or they need to cocoon for longer on the advice of their medical practitioner as they may be more susceptible to contracting the COVID-19 virus they may apply for standard illness benefit which is paid at a maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for qualifying adults and children.  Illness benefit claims require medical certification of illness that a person is incapable of work.</p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees can call on some statutory entitlements including supplementary welfare allowance.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

This TCA provides for up to 20 years of HomeCaring Periods in the pension entitlement calculation for applicants who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.</p><p>All contributory pensioners born on or after 1st September 1946 who had a reduced contributory pension based on post budget 2012 rate bands have now been reviewed.  The reviews provided for under the Social Welfare, Pension &amp;amp; Civil Registrations Act 2018 commenced from 13 February 2019, the day after I signed the necessary Regulations.  From April 2019, all State pension (contributory) applications are being assessed under all relevant rate calculation methods, including the interim total contributions approach.</p><p>When the TCA reviews were concluded at end-October 2019, a total of 94,258 reviews were completed, of which 56% were women and 44% were men.  As these reviews were processed, pensioners were notified and increases (where awarded) paid, together with arrears backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person&rsquo;s 66th birthday if later.  Those who did not qualify for an increase in payment (59% of those reviewed) continue to receive their existing weekly rate.</p><p>An increase in pension entitlement was awarded to 54% of women and 24% of men.  20,129 pensioners increased their rate of payment to the maximum rate of pension (72% women; 28% men).</p><p>Please see below in tabular form details of claimants reviewed, according to their county address at the time of review.  The figures represent 90% of total reviews, and include those who received an increase in their rate of payment and those who remained on their existing rate of payment.   <table>    <tr>       <th><div>County</div></th>       <th><div>Reviewed by County</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>997 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>1,347 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>2,510 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>9,305 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>2,729 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>22,091 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>4,761 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>3,159 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>3,672 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>1,636 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>1,189 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>689 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>3,632 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>752 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>2,046 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>2,850 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>3,239 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>1,178 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>1,299 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>1,344 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1,459 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>3,105 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>2,052 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>1,672 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>2,832 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>3,047 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

With this in mind, a public consultation on the design of the TCA was launched on the 28th May 2018.  A wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited to this launch.  In addition, the consultation involved a number of workshops with representative bodies, and a briefing and Question &amp;amp; Answer session for Oireachtas members by Department officials in Leinster House. </p>  <p>  The online consultation lasted for over three months and the Department received nearly 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, provision for home caring periods and for the self-employed. </p>  <p>  Having carefully examined the outputs of the TCA consultation process, officials in the Department are designing the scheme, with a view to including significant recognition for home caring periods in the new model.

The suspension was considered vital to ensure the future viability of businesses and to help prevent further permanent job losses. </p>  <p>  In light of the on-going emergency situation serious risks to jobs and businesses remain and the Government decided to extend the end date of the emergency measure from 31st May 2020 to 10th August 2020.  The Government has announced a roadmap for reopening society and businesses under which it is envisaged that most businesses should reopen by 10th August.  For employees an extension is important to ensure that they have a continued link to their employment and a pathway to return.  For employers, many still regard their businesses as being temporarily closed and plan to re-open as soon as is possible for them to do so.  </p>  <p>  If the end date was not extended further, a significant number redundancies could occur in the very near future which will burden employers with further debt and have a serious impact on the potential for a business to recover. This in turn increases the risk of insolvency and bankruptcy situations which will only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy has not been removed, but deferred for the emergency period in circumstances of temporary lay-off or short-time employment caused by the Covid-19 crisis. These arrangements have no effect on temporary lay-off and short-time work arising for reasons other than as a consequence Covid-19 where the rights of the employees remain unchanged. </p></reply>

However, I am aware of the issues for workers with childcare responsibilities, particularly for those working on the front line.  </p>  <p>  The Government has requested employers to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff, which could include partners of frontline workers, time off to look after their children or other members of their families.  Some of the flexible options include offering paid compassionate leave, allowing employees to work from home, altering shifts so that employees can coordinate caring between themselves and partners or another person, allowing employees to rearrange holidays and allowing employees to take paid time off that can be worked back at a later time. </p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees may be able to call on some statutory entitlements including force majeure leave, parental leave together with parental benefit or carers leave together with carers benefit or carers allowance.</p>  <p>  If a parent has left work to care for a child because of school or childcare closures and the employer is no longer paying the person&rsquo;s wages, they may qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

CE supervisors, as employees of those organisations, are an integral part of that good work.</p>  <p>  CE is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and others with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis. The programme is delivered through independent CE sponsoring bodies that receive state funding from the Department to cover the cost of CE employee remuneration. </p>  <p>  Funding for CE supervisors is available until the person reaches the state pension age. CE supervisors may apply for a State Pension on retirement from CE.  </p>  <p>  CE is a working age activation scheme and CE supervisors who continue to be funded through CE must be of working age.  As you will appreciate, if my Department continues to fund CE supervisors that have reached the state pension age it would significantly impact on the opportunities for those people who are still of working age and also, would undermine the reputation of CE as an active labour market programme.</p>  <p>  A number of CE supervisors have retired over the course of the Covid-19 emergency and recruitment of new CE supervisors has been managed by CE sponsoring bodies using processes that are in line with existing national guidelines.  The recruitment of new CE supervisors offers valuable employment opportunities to those of working age, including those who may be unemployed at present.  </p></reply>

Statistics in relation to overall approval/refusal rates in relation to the Scheme are not currently available.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s response to this emergency, ensuring that the inherent flexibility of the rent supplement is available, has been extended to 19 June 2020 and is being reviewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s continued response to the Covid emergency.  The Department has put in place specific measures to ensure that there are no undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a relatively short timeframe.  This included a redesigned 5 page application form and  ensuring resources were in place for areas with expected high levels of demand.  The standard time for applications to be processed is 2/3 working days.  The quick turnaround of applications received ensures customers do not experience arrears build ups, officers attempt to ensure that a person's rental obligations are met in full. </p><p>The cases that are currently in payment and awarded from the 13 March 2020 by county, along with cases currently pending a decision (or documentation still outstanding) are provided in the attached tabular statement.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1: Rent Supplement Awards Post 13th March &amp;amp; Pending Claims as at 2</b><b><sup>nd</sup></b><b>June 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>     County   </div></th>       <th>Awarded   RS Cases Post 13th March</th>       <th>Pending Cases</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CARLOW</td>       <td>101</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAVAN</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CLARE</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK</td>       <td>691</td>       <td>413</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DONEGAL</td>       <td>120</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN</td>       <td>2,679</td>       <td>605</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GALWAY</td>       <td>335</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KERRY</td>       <td>265</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILDARE</td>       <td>328</td>       <td>44</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILKENNY</td>       <td>123</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LAOIS</td>       <td>104</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LEITRIM</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LIMERICK</td>       <td>256</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LOUTH</td>       <td>117</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MAYO</td>       <td>135</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MEATH</td>       <td>207</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MONAGHAN</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OFFALY</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ROSCOMMON</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SLIGO</td>       <td>69</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TIPPERARY</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WATERFORD</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WESTMEATH</td>       <td>129</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WEXFORD</td>       <td>165</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WICKLOW</td>       <td>278</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>6,741</td>       <td>1,588</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The conditions for receipt of this payment are that a person must be of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have been in employment immediately before 13th March and have lost their income from employment.</p>  <p>  The age range for entitlement to the pandemic unemployment payment is consistent with other Social Protection income supports paid to working age persons.  The primary State income support paid by my Department in respect of people who are aged 66 years or over is the State Pension &ndash; either the Contributory State pension or the non-contributory (means-tested) pension. </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of the State contributory pension, which is based on PRSI contributions, can retain all of their State pension as well as their employment income and retain that pension payment if they lose employment income.  If a person is not in receipt of the maximum rate of State pension contributory, they may be eligible for an increased weekly rate of payment on the State non-contributory means tested pension depending on their circumstances.   </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of the non-contributory means-tested pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or if that employment income is reduced.  Similarly if a person aged over 66 who did not previously qualify or make an application for a means-tested pension may qualify for a pension payment if their circumstances change &ndash; including if they lose any employment income or if that employment income is reduced.</p>  <p>  If a person was in not in employment immediately prior to 13th March they are not eligible to receive the pandemic unemployment payment, which could include a seasonal worker who had not yet taken up employment.  It would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised employment, particularly where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Any person, of any age, who are experiencing financial hardship may be eligible for other financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance. </p>  <p>  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing third level education.  The matter of supports for students for the forthcoming academic year should be referred to the Minister for Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time. </p></reply>

A priority from the outset has been to ensure that income still flows into the households which need it most.  For example, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment can be paid concurrently with key supports for low income and lone parent families such as the Working Family Payment, One-Parent Family Payment and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment.</p>  <p>  As we gradually move through all the phases of reopening our society, we need to review the nature of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment - how it has been applied and how it fits into cross-Government plans to keep Ireland healthy and get the country working again.  We are currently considering all of this but I would emphasise that any future decisions will be based on our commitment that everyone who needs help will get the most appropriate assistance.</p></reply>

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, that the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  Medical practitioners are only authorised to submit medical certificates in respect of COVID-19 in respect of two very limited circumstances under the legislation.  These are for a person:</p>  <p>  - who is diagnosed with COVID-19, or</p>  <p>  - who is a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and is self-isolating &ndash; such persons will have either been certified by their Doctor or will have received personal HSE notification (that is, where they are contact-traced or otherwise personally identified and advised by the HSE as being a probable source of infection).</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with COVID-19.   Any changes to the current temporary scheme would need to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  Where an employee is unable to return to the workplace because they are still ill with Covid-19 they may apply for standard illness benefit which is paid at a maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203. Increases may also be paid for qualifying adults and children.  Illness benefit claims require medical certification of illness that a person is incapable of work.</p>  <p>  Where a person is not eligible for the enhanced rate, standard Illness Benefit payment may be payable subject to normal certification and eligibility criteria to a person with a serious health condition, where a medical practitioner certifies that a person is incapable of work due to the medical condition.  This may be paid for an extended period, depending on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.</p>  <p>  Employees who cocoon without a medical certificate may approach their employer in relation to taking annual or other paid leave - this is at the discretion of the employer.  Many employers can, and do, agree leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to alter shift patterns, to work-up time taken, or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.  The government has encouraged employers to support workers with leave requests at this difficult time and those with underlying health conditions should be facilitated where possible.</p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees can call on some statutory entitlements including supplementary welfare allowance.</p>  <p>   I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

Self-employed people must have experienced a collapse of income and be available to take up other full-time work if it was available to them in order to qualify.  Government has announced the continuation of this payment until 10th August which provides financial certainty as we move further, and at a faster pace that expected, towards re-opening our society. </p>  <p>  Where a self-employed person does not qualify for this emergency payment they can apply for a jobseekers payment.  If a person's business has ceased trading they can avail of  jobseekers benefit (self-employed) which I introduced in late 2019.  If a person&rsquo;s business is operating at a reduced level they may be eligible to apply for support under the means tested jobseekers allowance scheme. </p>  <p>  Where a person is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for other financial support through the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that my Department does not have detailed industry breakdowns of the number of people in receipt of the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment such as taxi drivers or PSV licence holders.

It is an income support payment for both employees and the self-employed who have become fully unemployed due to a downturn in economic activity related to Covid-19.  The Coivd-19 PUP is payable where a person meeting the qualifying criteria became unemployed on or after 6/3/2020.</p><p>A person is eligible to apply for the Covid-19 (PUP) if they: </p><p>- are aged between 18 and 66 years old and </p><p>- are currently living in the Republic of Ireland and </p><p>-have lost their job  due to the COVID-19 pandemic or </p><p>- have been temporarily laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic and </p><p>- worked in the Republic of Ireland or were a cross border frontier worker and </p><p>- are not in receipt of any employment income.</p><p>The PUP is not available to people who self-isolate due to an underlying medical condition.</p><p>In order to receive a Covid Illness Benefit (IB) payment a person must be diagnosed with Covid-19 or be medically certified as a probable source of infection in order to be eligible for Covid IB, in addition to having worked in the pervious four weeks.</p><p>If medical certification is provided by a doctor of a non-Covid-19 illness and if a person is eligible, payment is awarded at normal rate of IB.</p><p>I am advised that the records of my Department reflect that the person concerned is currently in receipt of an Illness Benefit payment at the normal rate of IB.  This payment has been certified up to 8/6/2020.</p><p>When the person concerned is certified medically fit to return to work and if he is concerned about returning to work due to Covid-19, he should contact his employer regarding this matter.  There are a number of steps an employer can take in line with social distancing guidelines to facilitate employees during this period including, introducing/altering shift patterns, allow employees to take time worked up, work remotely from home or bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.  Many employers can and do agree to compassionate leave in certain circumstances.</p><p>If the person concerned is experiencing financial difficulties at present, it is open to him to contact his local Community Welfare Service in Maynooth where his circumstances will be assessed.  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department can make a single Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  There is no automatic entitlement to these payments which are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The Community Welfare Service may be contacted by phone at 01 6016360.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

In line with all commercial and non-commercial State bodies, the LDA is required to comply with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, including ensuring that robust and effective systems are in place to ensure compliance as appropriate with the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The LDA Board is required to ensure that it has regard to appropriate models for investment appraisal for the appraisal and management of all investment proposals, including the Project Lifecycle introduced in the new Public Spending Code.  In addition under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, the Chairperson of each State body, including the LDA, should confirm in its annual report that the organisation is adhering to the relevant aspects of the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for the safeguarding of public funds expended from the Department&rsquo;s Vote and in accordance with the Code of Governance, is required to be satisfied that the requirements of the Code are being properly implemented and observed.  It is intended that my Department will be assisted in this regard by the advice provided by NewERA in exercise of its statutory advisory role under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  At present there is a Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and the LDA. Once the legislation to establish the LDA as a commercial state body is enacted, the LDA will be subject to the usual Departmental oversight arrangements for Commercial State Agencies as set out under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  In line with other commercial state bodies, when capital commitments are being entered into, the LDA will be required to seek Ministerial consent. </p>  <p>  At present, funding is provided to the LDA through my Department's Vote to meet its operational costs as well as initial capital funding in relation to the development of its projects. Following enactment of the LDA's primary legislation, it will be capitalised through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF). This ISIF financing will be used to progress the LDA's portfolio of projects and it is not envisaged that the LDA will receive funding allocations from my Department's Vote at that stage. In line with other State agencies, the LDA is responsible for ensuring it has its own systems in place in line with the Public Spending Code as set out above.  </p>  <p>  &euro;13.5 million of the LDA's 2019 capital allocation of &euro;16.5m was rolled over into 2020 as the LDA's projects were at initial pre-planning stages during 2019 and thus did not incur significant expenditure.  The capital funding to date has been used by the LDA to undertake pre-construction works in relation to their sites, including feasibility appraisal and master-planning and the details of this expenditure is an operational matter for the LDA.</p>  <p>  As with all State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department, arrangements have been put in place by the LDA through which Oireachtas members can request information directly from the Agency in relation to operational matters - in this regard, the LDA may be contacted directly at oireachtas@lda.ie for detailed information in relation to their expenditure.  </p></reply>

No 235 of 2019) - otherwise referred to as the Short-Term Letting Regulations - came into effect on 1 July 2019 with the aim of addressing the longer term rental issues arising from the use of properties for short-term letting purposes in designated Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), which are areas of high housing demand. These Regulations, which are operable until 31 December 2021, only apply within the designated RPZs and therefore do not apply to properties in other parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations, the owner a property in a RPZ which is not their principal private residence and who lets it for short-term letting purposes can, in order to continue such use of the property, apply for planning permission under section 34 of the Planning And Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), with a decision generally made by the planning authority within 8 weeks of receipt of the application. This applies to all short-term letting properties in RPZs which are not principal private residences. </p>  <p>  Where the owner of a property is unsure whether planning permission is required for short-term letting in their property, they can seek a declaration from the planning authority under Section 5 of the Act as to what, in any particular case, is or is not development or is or is not exempted development.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for making determinations in individual cases in this regard is an independent function of the relevant planning authority. Under Section 30 of the Act, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned, save in specific circumstances which do not apply in this case.</p>  <p>  I recognise the tourism benefits that the self-catering sector brings to many parts of the country, and am not opposed to the broader regulation of tourism activity, including the possible development of a new regulatory or licensing/registration system for commercial platforms and short-term letting agents which was recommended in the final Working Group report on the regulation of short-term lettings. However this is beyond the scope of the planning code and my remit. I corresponded with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the possible implementation of the recommendation which would fall to him to progress. I remain of the view that the possibility of developing a more nuanced approach to the regulation of short-term letting through regulation of online platforms rather than the regulation of properties in RPZs merits consideration, thereby enabling parts of the country that benefit from the tourism that comes from short-term letting to be able to continue to do so.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to amend exempted development regulations with regard to short-term letting at this time. </p></reply>

With the impact of the drought conditions continuing, my Department has now reconvened the Water Quality Sub-Group that sat during the drought period in 2018.</p>  <p>  Chaired by my Department, this multi-agency drought response coordination group considered the issues arising from the extended period of warm weather at its first meeting on Thursday, 4th June 2020.

More information on what is being done and what the public can do to lessen the pressures on water supplies is available at www.water.ie/water-supply/water-shortages/.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond the current dry period, the National Development Plan supports significant investment  to deliver robust and reliable water supplies that are climate resilient and that meet both current and future demands. Under the Plan, the Government has committed &euro;8.5 billion to improving the public water system.  Of this &euro;2.9bn is aimed at providing a safe and reliable water supply, which includes a national programme of investment to tackle leakage through the find and fix initiative (active leakage control).

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects and equipment.</p><p>My Department has channelled significant investment to fire authorities over the last number of years to improve the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s fire service infrastructure. Donegal County Council, in partnership with my Department, has made substantial progress in modernising fire stations in the county. They have replaced 12 of the 15 fire stations in the county from 1998 to 2009, with investment of some &euro;11 million by my Department. </p><p>In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. </p><p>My Department reviews the status of projects on the list on an annual basis, and adjustments, including some additions, are made to the published five-year programme. This includes consideration of additional fire station projects from fire authorities which fit the normal fire station project criteria and where an appropriate business case is presented. My Department has indicated to Donegal County Council that it will consider a proposal for advancing a fire station project in the south of the county as part of this Programme.</p><p>The investment by my Department in new vehicles and appliances for Donegal Fire and Rescue Service since 2016 is set out in table 1 below, and includes two new Class B fire appliances as well as four new all-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles. </p><p>Table 1- New vehicles provided under Fire Services Capital Programme to Donegal Fire Service <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Vehicle type</th>       <th>Amount &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>Three AWD vehicles</td>       <td>104,278</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>One AWD vehicle</td>       <td>75,353</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>One 'Class B' fire appliance</td>       <td>398,686</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>One 'Class B' fire  appliance</td>       <td>452,294</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td></td>       <td>1,030,611</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department has also approved funding for the purchase of previously owned vehicles/appliances and other capital items during the 2016-2019 period.

Membership of each Fora is managed locally, and based on local needs and capacities to respond.  </p>  <p>  The role of the Fora is ensure that everyone who needs support is identified, the support required is carefully assessed and the appropriate practical support is provided, by a trusted source. Such practical supports include the collection and delivery of food, meals, fuel, medication, pensions and other essential items, in strict accordance with public health advice.</p>  <p>  To support the work of the Forums further, in early April, my colleague, Mr Michael Ring TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development launched an Emergency Fund fund to support the community response. This &euro;2.5m fund was to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups participating in the "Community Call&rdquo; initiative.

This is, in effect, what is often colloquially referred to as a grandfather clause.</p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor. Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter is available on my Department's website at the following link: <font color="#0000FF"></font>.</p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also examined the matter and published its Report on the Title of Architect (July 2013) which is available at</p><p><font color="#0000FF">environmenttransportcultureandthegaeltacht/</font>Report-on-the-Title-of-Architect.pdf</p><p>Both reports, which were welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration. Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented, which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons. My Department and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.</p><p>In addition to the transitional &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision set out above, section 14(2)(f) of the Act provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. In 2016, the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a second prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section. Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended). For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.</p><p>My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made. I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are open to them and to continue to engage constructively with my Department and the RIAI.</p></reply>

The Board has granted permission on 132 SHD applications in respect of a total of 35,871 homes (comprising 9,583 houses, 20,962 apartments and 5,454 Build to Rent homes), 9,498 student bed spaces and 410 shared accommodation bed spaces. With regard to the other 72 applications; 36 were refused, 1 was referred back to the Board following judicial review, 1 was withdrawn, with the remainder still awaiting a decision.</p>  <p>  Of the applications that were granted permission under the SHD arrangements, it is understood that commencement notices have been lodged in respect of 38 of these projects to date. A total of 9,553 homes were permitted in the developments in respect of which commencement notices have been lodged (comprising 4,262 houses, 5,002 apartments and 289 Build to Rent homes), as well as 5371 student bed spaces.</p>  <p>  The recent review of the Strategic Housing Development arrangements highlighted that while they have generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected. Having reflected on the views of the Review Group on the rate of activation of SHD sites, it is considered appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner, given the efficiencies that the SHD arrangements provide.</p>  <p>  Therefore, I indicated that I considered that it would be appropriate to introduce a "use it or lose it" measure requiring developers to have commenced a certain level of development within a certain period of time on foot of a grant of an SHD planning permission. My Department has been developing proposals in this regard, the further advancement of which will be considered in context of the legislative programme of the incoming Government.</p></reply>

The closing date for applications is 25th June 2020 and it is anticipated that it will take a further nine weeks to go through the selection procedures before a suitable candidate is selected.</p>  <p>  The appointment of a chief executive designate will give confidence to the sector that preparation for a statutory framework is well underway. The appointment of a chief executive designate will allow for preparatory work to be carried out on setting up the office of the Regulator.

The ESB has outlined its programme of measures comprising preparation of a Remedial Environmental Impact Statement, a Remedial Natura Impact Statement and Substitute Consent Application, all of which are necessary elements to comply with the substitute consent process.  This information has recently been communicated to the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  No payment demand for daily fines accrued has yet been received from the European Commission. The daily fine rate was set by the EU Court of Justice at EUR 15 000 per day, to run from the date of the judgment (12 November 2019) until the date of compliance with the judgment. The daily fine accrued to date (9 June 2020) therefore stands at EUR 3,150,000.</p>  <p>  The final extent of daily fines which will be incurred is dependent upon the progress of the ESB, the owner and operator of the Derrybrien Wind Farm, in the substitute consent process.

An exemption from the local property tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 91/2013).</p><p>The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities, utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey. Only developments (and parts of developments) that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.  These Regulations applied to 421 developments, comprising approximately 5,100 homes, which remain exempt from LPT.  </p><p>In response to the specific matter in question, my Department has been in contact with Kerry County Council and my officials have been advised by the Council that the Estate was not included within the list of &ldquo;unfinished housing estates&rdquo; developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, as it did not meet the criteria for inclusion of a development or part thereof for Property Tax Waiver.  Accordingly, the occupier of any house within the Estate is liable for the local property tax.  I understand, however, that the Bond provider has relinquished the bond to Kerry County Council. The Council, with this funding, will now be arranging to have the outstanding works completed in the Estate.</p><p>There were a number of approaches adopted towards addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, including the development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs) for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible and the launch of the Public Safety Initiative (PSI) to address immediate public safety issues.  In addition, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF).</p><p>An Annual Progress Report was compiled and published every year from 2012 to 2018. These reports are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. For ease of access, the most recent report published in February 2018 is available at the following link: </p><p>As outlined in the Annual Progress Report 2017 (link provided above), the number of unfinished housing developments has reduced by 91% from around 3,000 developments in 2010, to 256 developments in 2017.  A list of unfinished housing estates can also be found under the &lsquo;unfinished&rsquo; tab layer on the MyPlan website available at the following link: www.myplan.ie</p><p>Given the significant progress made, there are no plans at this time to revise the list of developments included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013, either by removing or adding developments to it.  Local authorities will continue to assess the best options for resolution of unfinished developments and/or developments that are to be taken in charge. </p></reply>

This comprised 381 homes built directly by the local authorities, a further 658 homes delivered in partnership with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), 526 homes delivered through the Part V mechanisms and 100 homes restored to use under the Voids (capped) programme. This output represents 27.4% of the build output for the country. </p>  <p>  Looking at a single delivery stream, i.e. local authority build, in isolation does not accurately portray the housing delivery activity in a local authority area. AHBs are significant delivery partners, providing homes for social housing eligible households on local authority waiting lists.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the four Dublin local authorities face particular challenges regarding the availability and cost of land for new builds and in the context of this challenge, the four local authorities also delivered a further 844 homes through acquisitions (30% of the national output); speeding up the availability of homes for families in the Dublin region. A further 332 homes were delivered through the leasing programme.</p>  <p>  Nationally, more than 10,000 (10,007) new social housing homes were delivered through the delivery mechanisms of build (6,074), acquisition (2,772) and leasing (1,161) of which just under 29% (2,871) were delivered by the Dublin local authorities. </p>  <p>  The latest Construction Status Report covers the period up to end Q4 2019 and shows that since the beginning of Rebuilding Ireland, a total of 233 schemes have been completed by the four Dublin local authorities delivering 4,007 homes. In addition to this, the report shows that there are already a further 121 schemes currently at planning, design, tender or construction stage, which will deliver 3,518 additional homes when complete. The timing of these completions may cross annual reporting periods, resulting in variations from year to year, however the objective is certainly to increase annual outputs.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding, as well as technical support, advice and guidance to local authorities and AHBs to expand and accelerate their housing delivery, particularly around new build activity. Increasing build capacity is not an immediate input/output activity, it takes time to build capacity and supply, however this steady increase is visible in the outputs since 2016 when there were 657 new social home completions across 31 local authorities (excluding Voids) to over 5,770 in 2019. </p></reply>

The COVID-19 crisis gives rise to many challenges for the nation as a whole and is having an unprecedented impact on the arts, culture, heritage and Gaeltacht sectors.</p>  <p>  From an early stage in the COVID-19 crisis, measures were put in place to sustain our cultural infrastructure, support artists and arts practitioners and ensure the ongoing provision of cultural services.  Following a meeting I convened on 12 March with the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and Screen Ireland, the Arts Council announced a series of immediate measures, including an undertaking to honour all funding commitments made to organisations and allow grantees to draw down up to 90% of their funding commitment.</p>  <p>  The Government introduced a range of supports for those affected by COVID-19 and those working in the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors are eligible to apply for these supports.  My Department has published an advisory booklet on its website which sets out support and information available to the arts sector in response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are in ongoing contact with the Arts Council and as well as with a broad range of sectoral stakeholders including resource organisations, advocacy groups as well as individual artists and arts practices. </p>  <p>  The Council had undertaken a detailed survey of arts organisations to identify the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individual artists and the results are published on their website.</p>  <p>  The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector. This  group brings together a number of leading voices from the arts and other sectors and will report to the Arts Council on measures to sustain the arts sector through the current challenging period.  I understand that the Group will complete their work shortly and I look forward to receiving their report.</p></reply>

Organisations should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures. These organisations should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures. It is not necessary for organisations to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>My Department has published a new booklet on its website which sets out support and information available to the arts sector in response to the COVID-19 crisis. My Department also provides a helpdesk advice facility on income support for individuals at artsunit@chg.gov.ie and I would encourage people in the sector to make contact for advice.</p><p>The Government is providing a range of income supports for people who have lost employment as a result of the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the corona virus and are outlined as follows:</p><p>My colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is responsible for a range of income supports including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  The PUP is available to employees and the self-employed who have lost their job on (or after) March 13 due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Last Friday, the Government approved an extension to the PUP until 10th August 2020 with a number of changes to the payment. Further details can be accessed at this link .  I understand that thousands of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment have now closed or are in the course of closing  their claim as they had return  to work as part of the first phases  of the Roadmap for the Reopening of Society and Business.</p><p>Two jobseekers benefit schemes are in place for the self-employed as well as the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists. The latter scheme recognises the unique creative circumstances of artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.  <b></b></p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March to support the viability of firms and preserve the relationship between the employer and employee, insofar as is possible, by subsidising a portion of the employer wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by Covid 19.  This scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and along with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), it is a significant though temporary measure that has been introduced to attempt to minimise the negative impact on the labour market through an exceptional period. </p><p>Last Friday the Government agreed that the TWSS would be extended until the end of August. Over 59,000 employers are now registered with Revenue for this scheme and over 520,900 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme. I understand that as of 8th June, Revenue has generated further payments to employers under the scheme of &euro;34.2 million.. Further details can be accessed at this link - </p><p>The Government has introduced a range of business supports for those affected by COVID-19 and many of those working in the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors may be eligible to apply for these supports. These measures aim to help these organisations to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed.  Full details of these measures can be accessed on the gov.ie website at the following link </p><p>The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector.

My Department has worked with the Arts Council from an early stage in the COVID-19 crisis, on measures to sustain our cultural infrastructure, support artists and arts practitioners and ensure the ongoing provision of cultural services.  The Arts Council announced a series of immediate measures, including an undertaking to honour all funding commitments made to organisations and allow grantees to draw down up to 90% of their funding commitment. </p><p>My Department has published a new booklet on its website which sets out support and information available to the arts sector in response to the COVID-19 crisis. My Department also provides a helpdesk advice facility on income support for individuals at artsunit@chg.gov.ie and I would encourage people in the sector to make contact for advice.</p><p>The Government is providing a range of income supports for people who have lost employment as a result of the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the corona virus and are outlined as follows:</p><p>My colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is responsible for a range of income supports including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  The PUP is available to employees and the self-employed who have lost their job on (or after) March 13 due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Last Friday, the Government approved an extension to the PUP until 10th August 2020 with a number of changes to the payment. Further details can be accessed at this link .  I understand that thousands of people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment have now closed or are in the course of closing  their claim as they had return  to work as part of the first phases  of the Roadmap for the Reopening of Society and Business.</p><p>Two jobseekers benefit schemes are in place for the self-employed as well as the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists. The latter scheme recognises the unique creative circumstances of artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output.  <b></b></p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March to support the viability of firms and preserve the relationship between the employer and employee, insofar as is possible, by subsidising a portion of the employer wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by Covid 19.  This scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and along with the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), it is a significant though temporary measure that has been introduced to attempt to minimise the negative impact on the labour market through an exceptional period. </p><p>Last Friday the Government agreed that the TWSS would be extended until the end of August. Over 59,000 employers are now registered with Revenue for this scheme and over 520,900 employees have now received at least one payment under the scheme. I understand that as of 8th June, Revenue has generated further payments to employers under the scheme of &euro;34.2 million.. Further details can be accessed at this link . </p><p>The Government has introduced a range of business supports for those affected by COVID-19 and many of those working in the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors may be eligible to apply for these support. A number of organisations  may be eligible for funding supports under the series of  measures to  support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by COVID-19. These measures aim to help these organisations to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed.  Full details of these measures can be accessed on the gov.ie website at the following link </p><p>The Arts Council has established a short-term Advisory Group to identify ways to address impacts of the Covid-19 Crisis on the sector. This group brings together a number of leading voices from the arts and other sectors and will report to the Arts Council on measures to sustain the arts sector through the current challenging period.  I understand that the Group will complete their work shortly and I look forward to receiving their report.</p><p>The Council has also undertaken a detailed survey of arts organisations to identify the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individual artists and the results are published on their website.In the context of the wider cultural sector, officials from my Department are continuing to work with the Arts Council as well as other parts of Government, to assess and measure the effects of COVID-19 on the cultural sector and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to sustain the sector through this crisis. </p><p>While my Department makes allocations to local authorities for a number of cultural and creative purposes, including Commemorations and measures under the Creative Ireland programme,  local authority budgets are matters for the local authorities concerned. </p></reply>

The CRII regulations allow Members States to use unspent pre-allocated cohesion support, amounting to &euro;8 billion, to respond to COVID-19 by supporting healthcare systems and the working capital of SMEs to remain in business to cushion the impact of the shock, matched by a further &euro;29 billion in co-financing from the EU budget. </p>  <p>  In practice, CRII allows Member States to use funding under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) strand of cohesion support, which ordinarily finances investment into the regions, to assist in the COVID-19 emergency response. There are two regional ERDF Operational Programmes in Ireland, implemented by two Managing Authorities. It is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with the Managing Authorities, to reorient funding to areas of most need currently, in line with the provisions of CRII.</p>  <p>  The Creative Europe Programme is the main financial instrument at EU level to support the cultural and creative sector. At two recent meetings of the EU Council of Culture Ministers to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the actions to be taken to mitigate its effects, I, along with a number of my counterparts, called for an increase in funding to the next Creative Europe Programme as well as additional and immediate direct support to the sector as part of the EU Recovery Plan to help it through this crisis and to rebound in its aftermath.</p>  <p>  While discussions on the next EU budget are ongoing, several measures have been introduced with immediate effect in the Creative Europe Programme to protect the cultural and audiovisual sector while shut down, including; a new call for projects for the cross-border mainly digital distribution of performing arts works; &euro;5m in vouchers for hardest-hit cinemas; maximum flexibility for existing projects to reach completion; accelerated selection procedure for many schemes so that artists can start work under pre-funding arrangements; facility to invoke force majeure to recover sunk costs for stalled productions and works; and, maximum flexibility on the repayment of loans.</p>  <p>  Finally, the European Commission also recently published the EU Recovery Plan. The Plan includes a new initiative, REACT-EU, with a budget of &euro;55 billion. It is proposed that the funds will support workers and SMEs and will be available across sectors, including culture. While the Plan is now subject to negotiation and approval by the Council and European Parliament, I am confident that measures in the Plan, together with those under the Creative Europe Programme, and the whole suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government are helping to protect the cultural, creative and audiovisual sectors during shutdown and as we emerge from public health restrictions.</p></reply>

The main cause of such conflagrations is thought to be the deliberate starting of fires without concern for the consequences. There have been 7 significant fires, 1 within Killarney National Park, and 6 in Wicklow Mountains National Park in 2020. In addition there have been a number of smaller fires outside the boundaries of the Park on which my staff have assisted the emergency services.  These include a fire on NPWS land on All Saints Bog, Co Offaly,  Camp fires at Pollardstown Fen Nature Reserve and Sliabh Bloom Mountains Nature Reserve, and fires at  Cloonmoylan, Clooncullaun and Leaha bogs. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation for both National Parks and Wildlife Service staff and the Fire Service who are working tirelessly battling these conflagrations.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility in terms of fire-fighting lies with the Fire Service and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. My staff, however, remain ever-vigilant in conditions when conditions exist that might result in fires in the National Parks. In an effort to reduce the incidence of such fires, NPWS have deployed increased patrols  at our sites and remain in close liaison with both the Garda&iacute; and the Fire Services. Where appropriate, cross compliance is pursued with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo; fires. Finally, Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts 1976, as amended, prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation, with certain strict exemptions, from 1 March to 31 August. In addition, the Department, in partnership the Coillte Teo, has deployed drone technology in Wicklow and at the Sliabh Blooms.</p></reply>
