    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-09a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070900064#WRA00900"><p>Under the Programme for Partnership Government, the Government committed to applying to the European Commission for the revision of the TEN-T Core Network, including in relation to the Western Arc. A submission is currently being prepared in this regard, which would seek to facilitate consideration of transport-related project proposals for funding under the Connecting Europe Facility for transport in the Western Arc region. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the submission will also take into account national developments since the TEN-T Network was established, including the publication of our National Development Plan (NDP) and National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, as well as consideration of the implications for Ireland, including on western and north-west regions, stemming from the UK exiting the EU. </p>  <p>  The TEN-T Regulation explicitly states that the European Commission should take into account national implementation plans when carrying out the review of the TEN-T Network. In Ireland's case, these would include both the NDP and the NPF. Both of these Government documents will shape the future development of Irish planning and infrastructure across a range of sectors, including transport. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the UK's Withdrawal from the EU has been an evolving process over the last number of years, both in terms of the negotiations between the EU and the UK and in terms of contingency planning for a range of possible Brexit scenarios, which has been a whole-of-government effort coordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The preparation and making of a submission calling for a review of the TEN-T network should be strengthened by the proposals under the NDP and the NPF and by the added urgency of the implications of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Separately, in late February 2019, my Department received correspondence from European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, which stated that the European Commission is considering advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which is due to take place no later than the end of 2023, as stipulated in the TEN-T Regulation. The Commission's review process will include: an evaluation study, which will conclude in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation process, which will conclude on 17 July 2019; and targeted consultation with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders, to commence in the coming months. My Department intends to be fully engaged as part of this review process.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Western Rail Corridor, both the Programme for a Partnership Government and Project Ireland 2040 commit to an independent review of the costings for a proposal to extend the existing Corridor. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has appointed consultants to prepare a financial and economic appraisal, which will involve all relevant stakeholders, and the public consultation phase is underway. Upon completion, the  review will itself be subject to a verification process by my Department to ensure requirements are met and in particular, that a wide consultation has taken place. I expect the findings of the review, which will advise as to the business case for an extension of the Corridor, in the Autumn. It is my intention to bring the findings to Government for consideration at that point.</p>  <p>  Finally, I recently met with Minister of State Se&aacute;n Canney, in his capacity as Chair the Atlantic Economic Corridor Forum to discuss the review of the Core TEN-T Network and the potential for EU funding in this regard. I am committed to working with the Taskforce and Minister of State Canney on this matter and will be sharing a copy of my draft submission with the Department of  Department of Rural and Community Development and the Taskforce in advance if its submission to Commissioner Bulc.</p></reply>

The focus of Tll's activities over the coming years is, accordingly, directed towards the major national road improvement schemes listed in the  NDP.</p><p>Following consultation with TII, I can provide the following information and update to the Deputy on investment in the national road network in County Meath:</p><p><b>N2 Slane Bypass</b></p><p>The  proposed N2 Slane Bypass is included amongst a number of major national road schemes that are identified for development during the period of the NDP. The scheme is also contained in the NTA Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. </p><p>An N2 bypass of Slane is required to alleviate traffic congestion in the village and to reduce the potential for serious incidents due to the steep approaches to the very narrow Slane Bridge and the high commercial vehicle content in the traffic flow.  </p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>The project is currently at route selection  stage. This process is well advanced.  Once the preferred route is identified, the scheme will be progressed through planning and design.  A Business case will then be prepared for the approval of both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform. In addition, statutory documentation will be prepared, including the environmental impact assessment. Meath County Council has confirmed that the scheme will be lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2020, after adoption of the new County Development Plan. </p><p>TII has provided &euro;1m to Meath  County Council for planning work on the scheme this year.</p><p><b>N2 Rath to Kilmoon scheme</b></p><p>The proposed N2 Rath Roundabout to Kilmoon Cross scheme is among a number of major national road schemes identified in the NDP for progression through pre-appraisal and early planning. In this regard, Pre-Appraisal for the proposed scheme has been approved. </p><p>This 6 km Dual Carriageway scheme will address existing operational and safety problems on the N2, which has an annual average daily traffic of around 16,000 vehicles per day and experiences considerable peak time congestion.</p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>TII has issued approval to Meath County Council to procure technical advisors to commence design of the scheme. These Tenders have been received and are currently being assessed.  Once that contract is awarded, it typically takes three to five years from this point through Phases 1 to 4 of the Project Management Guidelines, to have a scheme ready to submit to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning approval.</p><p>This year, TII has provided an allocation to Meath County Council of &euro;250,000 to allow the scheme to progress to planning and design.</p><p><b>Curragha Junction</b></p><p>Traffic problems at Curragha are exacerbated by traffic trying to avoid the delays at Primatestown and also traffic heading to Tayto Park. </p><p>The Ashbourne Municipal District  Engineer has been installing and maintaining signage at the junction as well as hedge-cutting. Meath County Council has also prepared a preliminary design to calm traffic and improve definition at the junction and safety on the approaches, including the R155 as it passes through the village of Curragh itself.</p></reply>

Donegal the Trans European Network-Transport (TEN&ndash;T) Comprehensiveroad network runs from the Leitrim County Boundary (on the outskirts of Bundoran to the Border with  Derry in the Northeast at Bridgend, on the outskirts of Derry City, and involves sections of the N13, N14 and N15.  </p><p>- In 2016 Donegal County Council commissioned a Corridor Needs Study on the TEN-T Comprehensive  network within Donegal.  The study identified projects to improve the TEN-T Comprehensive network to the required standard under TEN- T regulations.  The Study identified a priority list of schemes.  It recommended three priority projects to advance:</p><p>- N15/N13  Ballybofey &ndash; Stranorlar Bypass </p><p>- N56/N13/N14Letterkenny Bypass, and Letterkenny-Manorcunningham Dual Carriageway</p><p>- N14  Manorcunningham-Lifford Realignment, including the N14/N15 link to the A5 in Northern Ireland</p><p>The Bonagee Link Road, or the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road, forms part of the proposed Letterkenny Bypass.  </p><p>Transport Infrastructure  Ireland  (TII) has provided an allocation of &euro;2.5m in 2019 to Donegal County Council to progress planning work on priority national road improvements projects that were identified in the study on the TEN-T Network I mentioned.  These projects are identified as Strategic Investment Priorities in the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.</p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>Feasibility Studies for the priority schemes commenced in 2017 and the route selection process is ongoing.  Public consultations on identified route options were held in April and May 2018 in Letterkenny, Lifford and Ballybofey. </p><p>An  Emerging Preferred Route Corridor for each section has now been identified.  Public Consultations on these Emerging Corridors took place in February. </p><p>It can typically take 8 to 13 years to bring a major project from conception to completion.  There is no timeframe fixed yet for completing the Bonagee link road project, as it will need to obtain both Business Case approval and Planning Consent and will be subject to the availability of funding in the future.</p></reply>

I do not have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of public transport services.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally. It also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of Local Link services funded under the Rural Transport Programme. </p>  <p>  Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and small public service vehicles (SPSV) services, which include Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney services.  </p>  <p>  The bus and coach services include Public Service Obligation (PSO) services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and other operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, licensed services provided by commercial operators and Local Link services.  </p>  <p>  These services comprise conventional fixed services with regular routes, stopping places and timetables and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services which respond to local demands and which constitute the vast majority of Local Link services.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of bus services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas. </p>  <p>  The increased funding has enabled the introduction of 66 new commuter services into the Local Link network, operating five, six or seven days per week, as well as demand-responsive services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages. </p>  <p>  Following my engagement with key stakeholders, I tasked the NTA to examine how to extend existing Local Link services to provide additional services in the evenings. These new services, which are a mixture of extension to existing services and demand responsive services, have been operating on a pilot basis since last summer and 59 services are continuing until the end of this year.</p>  <p>  I am aware that public bus transport cannot meet the demands for travel for many people in rural Ireland, either because it is not available at all or it is not available at the time needed. Taxis and hackneys play an important role in meeting the travel demand when public transport is not available. However, there are gaps in the provision of taxis and hackneys in many rural communities. </p>  <p>  To address gaps in service delivery, the NTA is developing two pilot schemes for implementation this year.  Both schemes will be administered locally by the existing network of Local Link offices who will act as agents of the NTA.  The overall management, funding and regulation of both schemes rests with the NTA. The NTA has advised that it proposes to issue the call for applications for both the Local Area Hackney and the Community Transport Services together by the end of the summer.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The purpose of the Group was to review the existing governance arrangements within the FAI and to propose a governance framework which would support the Board and the organisation in achieving and observing good governance practice.</p>  <p>  It is clear from their report that the Group conducted a very comprehensive review of governance practices and procedures in the Association.  This is a necessary first step for the FAI to rebuild public confidence in the association.</p>  <p>  It has become increasingly evident over the last few months that the standards of corporate governance and financial management within the FAI currently were unacceptable.  The Review Group has presented a detailed set of proposals covering a wide range of issues including the association's Board, commercial partnerships as well as audit and risk management.  These proposals have been endorsed by Sport Ireland.  The proposals will now be considered by the FAI membership at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 20 July and at the Annual General Meeting on 27 July.  I hope that the members will seize this opportunity to adopt many of the proposals in this review.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of other reviews and investigations ongoing into specific matters at the FAI, including an investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Any determinations or recommendations made by the ODCE on foot of its investigation should, of course, be abided by.  I have no information on when the ODCE's investigation or any of the other reviews commissioned by the FAI will be completed. </p>  <p>  I know that there is a long and steep road ahead for the Association in terms of the transition that must be achieved for the good of the Association, its members and Irish football and I would encourage all of those who are responsible for enabling the transition to support and lead all necessary reforms.</p></reply>

During last year&rsquo;s consultation a number of specific issues were raised by members of the public, and indeed elected representatives, including issues in relation to the proposed upgrade of the Luas Green Line to a metro-style service.</p>  <p>  These issues helped inform this year's development of MetroLink&rsquo;s &ldquo;Preferred Route&rdquo;. I understand that approximately 2,000 submissions have been received during this most recent consultation period and those submissions are currently being considered by the NTA and TII and a summary report of submissions will be published by the NTA and TII later in the year.</p>  <p>  As regards strategic transport planning for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), the Deputy is well aware of the well-developed, modern, statutory framework which underpins the development of public transport infrastructure.  It is a plan-led, long-term and integrated approach toward strategic transport planning with statutory links into land-use planning in the GDA and it reflects international best practice in the field. </p>  <p>  The framework is underpinned by the development by the NTA of a statutory Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area.  The current Strategy was approved in 2016 and sets out a wide range of projects and programmes to be delivered across active travel, rail, metro, light rail and bus.  The increased funding made available under Project Ireland 2040 means that we can turn the ambition of the Strategy into reality and fund construction of the various prioritised projects over the next 10 years.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is, however, flexible and allows for consideration of demographic and other changes over the period to be considered every six years. This statutorily required review period also allows for consideration of whether there are additional projects and programmes that warrant inclusion within any revised Strategy. I understand that the NTA will commence a review of the current Strategy toward the latter half of 2020 and that will allow for stakeholders to make their views known.  </p>  <p>  Those who seek to overturn this plan-led approach toward strategic transport planning endanger the advances made in integrating transport and land-use planning in recent years, advances which are vitally important if we are going to deliver a more sustainable Ireland in the years ahead. </p></reply>

In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide just over &euro;300m in subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.  The Deputy is suggesting an idea of abolishing fares.  One of the factors to take into account is that the amount collected from fares is approximately &euro;600 million annually.  This means that the rough cost to the taxpayer of eliminating fares would be in the region of &euro;600 million more every year - in addition to the amounts already spent on PSO and on capital investment.  And this amount would only enable continuation of the existing level of service and passengers, without factoring in the costs of catering for increased passenger travel demand.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in focussing on the need to reduce private car emissions and also to stimulate and support increased uptake of public transport.  That is exactly the Government's approach as set out in our recent Climate Plan.  According to 2017 emission estimates:  </p>  <p>  - Around 52% of transport emissions come from private car use;  </p>  <p>  - Just over 18% comes from the freight sector; and </p>  <p>  - Around 4.4% of emissions come from the public transport fleet.</p>  <p>  As such, it is clear that inroads must be made in reducing the dominance of the private car in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector.</p>  <p>  Modal shift from the private car to sustainable means of transport remains central to the transport sector&rsquo;s response to climate change.  Investment in public transport led to an increase of almost 58 million journeys on subsidised public transport and commercial bus service since 2012.  Last year we saw an increase of 16.3 million passenger journeys provided by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Luas and Go-Ahead Ireland on PSO services.  That is an increase of over 6.5% compared to 2017.  I think the Deputies would agree that this increase in passenger growth is very positive.  The growth in public transport services has been supported by higher levels of subvention in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and as I mentioned earlier it was increased again this year to provide a total allocation of over &euro;300m.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the prevalence of the private car and encourage a shift to more sustainable forms of transport, a number of key policy measures to increase public transport capacity will be progressed over the next decade.  The National Development Plan has earmarked &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public and sustainable transport to 2027.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of bus services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas. The increased funding has enabled the introduction of new commuter services into the Local Link network, including new evening services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages. The NTA is also developing two pilot schemes for implementation this year for both a Local Area Hackney and a Community Transport Service, to be administered locally by the existing network of Local Link offices throughout the country.</p></reply>

The Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption.</p>  <p>  The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, plays a key role in the national decarbonisation effort. It is worth noting that transport emissions are classified under both the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS systems. Generally, non-domestic emissions such as those from international aviation within Europe are accounted for under the ETS system while domestic transport emissions fall under the non-ETS system. The Climate Action Plan deals primarily with the non-ETS sector, where Ireland has a legal binding emissions reduction target of 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels).  Accordingly, the focus of the transport elements of the Plan relate mainly to reducing land transport emissions and not those generated by international travel and in-coming tourists. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions for inclusion in the Climate Action Plan, particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.  A critical challenge is reducing the 52% of transport emissions that come from private car use.  Our aim in expanding the carrying capacity and the attractiveness of our public transport and active travel networks is to provide a viable sustainable alternative to private car use for more people for more of their journeys. Under Project Ireland 2040, an indicative allocation of &euro;8.6 billion is assigned to support sustainable mobility ensuring that public transport and active travel become more available and attractive alternatives. </p>  <p>  A switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key mitigation measure of the Plan, with a target of almost 950,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2030. While this level of transition is incredibly challenging, as technologies improve and become cheaper, and if we continue incentives and invest in the recharging network we are ambitious that with a real push we can make real progress towards this target by 2030. Concerted efforts across several Departments will be essential if we are to maintain a supportive environment to assist citizens in making the greener choice and switching to an EV. My Department and I will work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the roadmap that will be necessary to achieve our collective ambition.</p>  <p>  In terms of tourism, while there are no specific actions in the Plan, climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. Urban tourism may be less affected than coastal tourism where sea level rise, increasing ocean acidification and coastal erosion can threaten Ireland&rsquo;s coastal tourism infrastructure and natural attractions. It is difficult to predict possible changes to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination as a result of climate change and the impact of this on the economic value of tourism in Ireland and tourism demand. Destination attractions such as Skellig Michael and the Burren could be especially vulnerable; therefore the role of the tourism sector in adaptation planning is extremely important. </p>  <p>  The range of implications of climate change on the transport, tourism, and even sport sectors means that I and my Department is fully committed to achieving the climate change objectives set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Indeed, every sector must step-up if Ireland is to meet our emission reduction targets in 2030 and beyond.</p></reply>

Funding to support the development of this infrastructure is available through the indicative allocations provided under Project Ireland 2040 and administered on my Department's behalf by the National Transport Authority. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides an indicative allocation of &euro;200 million to support the development of a BusConnects programme in Galway.  Under the BusConnects programme, the bus fleet will transition to low-emission technologies.  The recently published Climate Action Plan also contains actions to accelerate the decarbonisation of the public bus fleet with the objective to only have low-emitting buses in the urban PSO bus fleet by 2035.  These are part of a wide-ranging set of actions for transport in the Climate Action Plan particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.  These actions will be implemented in line with the commitments given within the Plan.  </p></reply>

In this way we will lower climate-harmful emissions, begin to tackle congestion and see an improvement in local air quality. </p>  <p>  This Plan includes our commitment to deliver an additional half a million public transport and active travel journeys daily by 2035. This is a significant step up in our ambition and requires expanding the capacity and attractiveness of our walking and cycling networks as well as our public transport system.  </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, we have assigned &euro;8.6 billion to support sustainable mobility. In addition to support for key public transport projects this investment will vastly improve the cycling and walking infrastructure in all our major cities. In fact, this &euro;8.6 billion investment budget is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment in the past. </p>  <p>  Over the period 2018-2021:  </p>  <p>  - &euro;110 million will be specifically dedicated  to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas; </p>  <p>  - &euro;750 million is earmarked for the BusConnects programme in Dublin to include the delivery of around 200 kilometres of segregated cycling lanes; and </p>  <p>  - &euro;53 million will be used to support the development of new Greenways. </p>  <p>  This will support the increasing numbers of people who choose cycling as their preferred mode of transport, including E-bikes users.  It is clear that prioritising investment in our cycling network is already working; the number of annual cycling trips is increasing, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area with surveys such as the Canal Cordon Count showing cycling numbers almost doubling between 2011 and 2018. </p>  <p>  We need to build on this and do even more. Key actions under the Climate Plan underpin this commitment to increasing cycling as a mode of travel, including the establishment of a Cycling Project Office within the National Transport Authority and the development of implementation plans and increased cycling infrastructure for Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The Cycling Project Office will ensure that the new cycling infrastructure is delivered optimally, in line with the significantly increased funding that is being provided. </p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work Scheme also continues to encourage the use of bicycles and e-bikes to travel to and from work. Under the scheme an eligible employer can buy a bicycle for their employees and the employee pays the amount, less the tax relief, over up to 12 months through a salary sacrifice arrangement. Up to &euro;1,000 can be provided for towards the purchase of a new bicycle or e-Bike which is a generous contribution towards any commuter bicycle, but especially towards an e-bike which are generally more expensive. </p>  <p>  The climate challenge needed a step-up in ambition and a renewed determination across Government and society to tackle climate disruption - the Climate Action Plan has given us this required level of focus and drive. I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Cycling will play an important role  in this decarbonisation effort and I am dedicated to investing and improving our cycling network. </p></reply>

This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, including the rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant calls for proposals.</p></reply>

In the recently published Climate Action Plan 2019 this Government has committed toward an additional 500,000 daily journeys by 2035 being made by sustainable modes as compared to today.</p>  <p>  To support that ambition, I have secured significant increases in funding which will deliver improved and expanded sustainable transport networks. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will welcome the fact that Project Ireland 2040 provides indicative allocations toward sustainable mobility measures which are well above what we will be investing in new roads over the period. This rebalancing of investment priorities is a reversal of the balance of investment between these two areas in the past and is very much welcome.</p>  <p>  Active travel, both walking and cycling, have an important role to play, particularly in our larger urban areas, in supporting the shift toward sustainable mobility and the increased funding being made available will support people&rsquo;s choice in making the shift.</p>  <p>  This increased funding is significant and over the period 2018 to 2021 amounts to approximately: </p>  <p>  - &euro;110 million specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas; </p>  <p>  - &euro;135 million for sustainable urban transport measures;  </p>  <p>  - &euro;750 million towards the BusConnects programme in Dublin which will include the delivery of around 200 kilometres of segregated cycling lanes, where possible; and </p>  <p>  - &euro;53 million to support the development of new Greenways.</p>  <p>  This year alone a number of important active travel projects are under construction or scheduled to start construction and I am keenly aware of the need to ensure timely delivery of new infrastructure to facilitate ever greater numbers of people making active travel part of their daily lives. As stated in the Climate Action Plan the National Transport Authority will later this year establish a new Office within its organisation to work with local authorities in making sure that the increased investment now available results in increased activity on the ground. </p>  <p>  At a policy level I will shortly launch a public consultation in relation to our current public transport and active travel policy and this consultation will inform the development of a new policy statement which will then provide the policy backdrop for the years ahead. I look forward to the Deputy's engagement in this review and hearing his views on what measures should be considered. </p></reply>

As the transport sector accounts for a little over one quarter of Ireland's non-ETS emissions there is no question that it must feature strongly in the national decarbonisation effort. </p>  <p>  In 2017 the passenger car fleet accounted for approximately 52% of land transport emissions and accordingly electric vehicles (EVs) are a prominent mitigation technology in the Plan, with a target of almost 950,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2030. This is a very challenging target; however, as technology improves and becomes cheaper, and if we continue to incentivise and invest in EVs and the associated recharging network, we are ambitious that we can make real progress towards getting the electric vehicles we need on the road by 2030. Concerted efforts across several Departments will be essential if we are to maintain a supportive environment to assist citizens in making the greener choice and switching to an EV. The target is a very challenging one and is indicative of the scale of transformation required across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceilings.</p>  <p>  Globally, electric vehicles are the leading solution to the decarbonisation of private car transport. It is the Government&rsquo;s job to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making the greener choice and selecting electric vehicles now and in the years to come.</p>  <p>  To that end, an interdepartmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce,  co-charied by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment (DCCAE), was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate EV take-up. Preliminary recommendations from the Taskforce were considered ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019 and a suite of continued and new EV supports were subsequently announced. Principal supports, such as the EV Purchase Grant Scheme, the Domestic Charger Grant and the roll out of an extensive recharging network, fall under the remit of the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment. In tandem, I am responsible for two further initiatives: the Electric Vehicle Toll Incentive (EVTI) Scheme and the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  The EVTI was designed to encourage private car commuters who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an EV. It is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 heavy toll users in Ireland so reduced tolls act as a meaningful incentive for a large number of vehicle owners. I have committed to continuing this incentive until 2022 or until a threshold of 50,000 registrations has been reached. </p>  <p>  The eSPSV Grant Scheme promotes the use of EVs in taxis/hackneys/limousines. Recognising the important role that the SPSV sector can play in demonstrating EV technology to a wider audience I have agreed, under the Climate Action Plan, to improve the value of the eSPSV grant to those transitioning to wheelchair accessible electric SPSVs to make EVs available to a greater number of our citizens.</p>  <p>  Finally, support from the Department of Finance has also been fundamental in establishing the current positive policy environment under which we have already seen electric vehicle sales rise steeply over the past year, albeit from a low base. According to the latest figures, approximately 11,500 EVs were under taxation at the end of May 2019. This is double the amount that was on Irish roads at the end of May 2018. In order to continue this trajectory I will continue to work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to avail fully of increased supply of EVs, of improved technology and falling prices that are expected worldwide. </p></reply>

Accordingly, converting our public transport fleets to lower-carbon alternatives including electricity will have a limited, though positive, impact on reducing national CO2   emissions. That said, I believe that moving to low-emission alternatives for public transport is important so as to promote and normalise the use of non-conventional lower-emitting fuels and technologies. </p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low-emission buses has been outlined. We are committed in Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this month. In preparation for both this immediate transition and the development of a longer-term low-carbon bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the National Transport Authority (NTA), Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks. Under the BusConnects Programme it is expected that approximately half of the public urban bus fleet will have moved to lower-emitting alternatives by 2023 with full conversion by 2030.</p>  <p>  The NTA has recently initiated a tender competition to award a &ldquo;Framework Agreement for the Supply of Double-Deck Diesel-Electric Hybrid Buses&rdquo; with the number of vehicles to be purchased being decided on an annual basis in line with replacement requirements, capacity needs and funding availability, in addition to taking into account developments in other vehicle technologies.</p>  <p>  Electrifying key, heavily used elements of the rail network must also be considered if the transport sector is to achieve its decarbonisation objectives. We plan to create a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks. The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recently commenced a procurement process for the establishment of a 10-year framework agreement for the purchase of additional lower-emitting rail fleet required for the expansion of the DART network. These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low-carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact our sectoral emissions profile. </p>  <p>  Finally, in the small public service vehicle (SPSV) or taxi sector, the Electric SPSV Grant Scheme opened to applicants in February 2018 and provides purchase reliefs of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The Scheme was continued into 2019.</p>  <p>  I am happy that a comprehensive programme of work is well underway to reduce the public transport sector&rsquo;s carbon footprint.</p></reply>

We discussed what could be done to get the institutions in Northern Ireland up and running again.  Once again, I emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  The Government wants to see an agreement in place to secure the operation of the devolved institutions and we will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek to progress that in the period immediately ahead.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the challenge is for the parties to find an agreement. This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved to get the devolved, power-sharing Assembly and Executive and the NSMC functioning again.</p>  <p>  I last met with DUP Leader Arlene Foster while in the United States for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. We discussed the situation regarding Brexit, as it stood at the time, including prospects for ratification by the UK of the Withdrawal Agreement. We also discussed political developments in Northern Ireland, including the importance of the restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.  I also spoke with Ms Foster at events we were both attending.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the leaders of the political parties there in every week of the talks so far, to encourage the parties to reach an accommodation, and I receive regular updates from the T&aacute;naiste and from my officials who are involved in the talks process.</p></reply>

As a result of this, in the period between Quarter 4 of 2017 and July 2018, a number of public information campaigns aimed at improving citizens' lives, such as the Healthy Ireland campaign, the Project Ireland 2040 campaign and the Self-Employed Benefits campaign, were run and funded from my Department.  This was a departure in approach from previous years, when such campaigns would have been led and funded by the relevant line Department.  Since July 2018, the Department has reverted to the previous model.</p><p>These public information programmes were aimed at the Irish general public, with the exception of the promotion of Global Ireland, which was targeted at international audiences in the UK and the US. The total amount spent was &euro;184,869; the remainder of expenditure outlined above was targeted at a general audience here in Ireland.</p><p>The purchase of digital and online space is managed through a media-buying company contracted to the Department, PHD Media.</p><p>As stated above, all expenditure related to cross-Government public information programmes.

Engaging with search engine promotion helps ensure the public is directed to the sites that deliver the services/information they are looking for. Using sponsored posts on Social Media ensures a strong dissemination of Government Information.</p></reply>

For this analysis, unemployment blackspots were defined as EDs which contained at least 200 persons in the labour force and which had an unemployment rate of at least 27 per cent, as defined on the basis of the Principal Economic Status question asked in the Census.</p><p>The Principal Economic Status question in the Census asked persons how they would describe their present principal status; the response options included the categories &ldquo;at work&rdquo; and &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo;.  This is different from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification of unemployment used in the quarterly Labour Force Survey, in which unemployment is measured as persons who, in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work within the next two weeks, and had taken specific steps in the preceding four weeks to find work.</p><p>This analysis of unemployment blackspots is only available from the Census of Population; the CSO has no corresponding small-area statistics for more recent periods.</p><p>The CSO did not define or publish statistics on youth unemployment blackspots from the 2016 Census.</p><p>Therefore, the unemployment rates for the Electoral Divisions listed as unemployment blackspots in the Census 2016 results which are set out in the

The inclusion of a commitment within that agreement to establish an independent and transparent investigation into violent crackdown against protestors on 3 June is also welcome.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the recent allegations that the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces, which emerged from remnants of the Janjaweed militia in Darfur, receive financial support from the EU Trust Fund for Africa, which was established to fight human trafficking and to provide protection and support for refugees. The EU has strongly refuted this claim and confirmed that it does not provide any financial support to the Government of Sudan, to the Transitional Military Council or to the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces. All EU support to Sudan is delivered by EU Member States, the UN, international organisations and non-governmental organisations and is underpinned by respect for human rights.  My officials will continue to scrutinise all new proposals, to ensure adequate safeguards are in place, for funding to Sudan under the EU Trust Fund.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has condemned the use of sexual and gender-based violence against protestors in Sudan.  Ireland&rsquo;s third National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security, launched on 21 June, strongly reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to preventing sexual and gender-based violence in conflict settings and to ensuring support for recovery and relief in post-conflict settings. Today, 9 June, Ireland delivered a national statement on Sudan at the Human Rights Council in Geneva calling for all human rights violations and abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence, to be thoroughly investigated in an independent and transparent manner with those responsible held to account.</p>  <p>  Senior officials from my Department met the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year to express concerns at the political situation.  My Department's ongoing communication with the Embassy on the evolving situation in Sudan allows our concerns to be formally transmitted to the Sudanese authorities.  Officials also recently met with representatives of the Sudanese community in Ireland to listen to their concerns and views regarding how the current impasse may be resolved.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;29 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan. As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed to humanitarian support in Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Sudan Humanitarian Fund, and provided financing of &euro;3 million in 2019. In 2018, the fund provided assistance to just under 2 million beneficiaries, including 489,556 girls and 609,162 women. Programmes funded by the Sudan Humanitarian Fund include Gender-Based Violence programming and supports.</p></reply>

It found that, over the past year, LGBTI activities and Pride parades have been banned or stopped by police in several provinces; that hate speech against the LGBTI community is a common occurrence; and discrimination against the LGBTI community remains widespread throughout Turkey.</p>  <p>  Around the world, Irish Embassies and Consulates cooperate closely with EU delegations and Embassies of the other EU Member States to advocate for the rights of LGBTI persons. For example, our Embassy in Ankara provides funding to a local LGBTI advocacy group, most recently for a project that focuses on the reporting of human rights violations against trans people, and in 2017 the Embassy sponsored the screening of &lsquo;Queen of Ireland&rsquo;, during the EU Human Rights Day Film Festival.</p>  <p>  The banning of the Istanbul Pride Parade for the fifth year in a row is regrettable, particularly as the parade was allowed for many years before. The use of tear gas to disperse those who nevertheless gathered to mark the occasion is even more regrettable, as all Turkish citizens should be allowed to exercise their right to peaceful assembly.</p>  <p>  Together with our European partners, we are deeply concerned by Turkey&rsquo;s backsliding on fundamental rights, which has negative effects not only on the LGBTI community, but also on wider society. Turkey is party to the European Convention on Human Rights, a member of the Council of Europe, and a candidate for membership of the European Union, and as such has committed to respect the fundamental rights of citizens.</p></reply>

This programme is delivering major upgrades to passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as making significant customer service improvements to the Passport Service.  It is envisaged that as part of this reform the online application process will be rolled out to first-time applicants by 2021.</p>  <p>  From January to June this year, the Passport Service has seen a 10.1% increase in passport applications compared to the same six-month period in 2018. 45% of all applications received in the first six months of this year have been online applications. In this period, 62% of all those eligible to use the online renewal service have chosen this option. This compares to 31% for the same time period in 2018.</p>  <p>  A strong take-up of online services will greatly improve the capacity of the Passport Service to manage increasing application volumes.

Where possible and appropriate, the Department examines the scope for purchase with a view to converting rental payments into long-term assets for the state.  My Department follows guidance and seeks approval from Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the acquisition and disposal of assets in such cases.</p></reply>

Specific activities included advertisements on social media platforms, print ads, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations.</p><p>In Q4 2018 the service was expanded to include online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a passport card for children and a wider cohort of adults eligible to renew online.  This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24/7 from anywhere in the world. My Department ran a three-week public information campaign including advertisements on social media platforms, print ads and radio ads. The success of this campaign has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications in Q1 2019.</p><p>The direct costs of online and social media advertising to raise public awareness amongst Irish citizens in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>- <b>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council</b></p><p>On July 2<sup>nd</sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online, and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>- <b>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;</b></p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign have formed part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep citizens fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit.</p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. This service has a global reach with 37.7% of the subscribers of the service coming from outside of Ireland.</p><p>My Department also coordinated a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.  This campaign updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as on public workshop events that were held over successive weeks throughout October and the last two weeks in November. A programme of awareness raising via online and social media platforms also took place.  Costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>- <b>St Patrick&rsquo;s Day</b></p><p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a unique opportunity to engage with the global Irish community and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the National Day of any other country.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s programme had the largest number of countries ever visited for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. The Taoiseach and I, along with 13 Ministers, 19 Ministers of State, the Attorney General, Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach visited 56 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific region.  These programmes allowed us to promote trade, investment and tourism with Ireland, to increase visibility in new markets, and to promote our values and our influence in global institutions, notably in support of our campaign to become a member of the United Nations Security Council.  It also allowed us to deepen our connections with Irish people and friends of Ireland all over the world.</p><p>Team Ireland overseas delivered a total of 1,796 events in support of Ireland&rsquo;s interest over the 2019 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in this context.  To coincide with and complement these activities, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to online promotion of an accompanying St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day video as outlined in Table 1 below. In addition to Ireland, the video in question was also promoted in certain areas of the USA and continental Europe (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) to audiences with strong Irish diaspora connections and/or related potential disposition to Ireland as a tourism destination.</p><p>- <b>Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025</b></p><p>&lsquo;Global Ireland&rsquo; is an all-of-Government programme which aims to double Ireland&rsquo;s impact in the world by 2025. The programme was launched by the Taoiseach and myself and Ministers Humphreys, Madigan and McEntee in June 2018 and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions in relation to how we trade, the bilateral and multilateral partnerships that we seek to build and our wider contribution to the world.</p><p>Global Ireland: Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada 2019&ndash;2025 is Ireland's first whole-of-Government strategy for the US and Canada. Its aim is for Ireland to build strong, strategic political partnerships with the US and Canada and assume a lead role in building stronger transatlantic relations.</p><p>To coincide with the programme of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day-related activities held there earlier this year, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to the online promotion of a video that outlined the Strategy&rsquo;s key objectives insofar as the US is concerned.  In addition to Ireland, the video in question was also promoted in the various areas of the US where Irish diplomatic missions are located &ndash; viz., Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Washington D.C. &ndash; so as to support and facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with key audiences in each case.</p><p>- <b>Travelwise</b></p><p>TravelWise is an award-winning smartphone app designed to help Irish citizens to stay safe and informed while travelling, living or working overseas.</p><p>A core part of our mission is to help ensure the safety and welfare of Irish people travelling abroad by providing accessible and relevant information. There are increasing numbers of Irish residents travelling abroad &ndash; more than 7 million trips abroad &ndash; and increasing numbers travelling to higher-risk locations.</p><p>TravelWise has been developed by the Department to provide travel advice and consular information to these citizens to keep them informed and aware. To coincide with its launch in 2016 my Department spent a small amount to promote its uptake.</p><p>- <b>Other Projects</b></p><p>My Department has also engaged in social media promotion of certain other initiatives and projects that relate to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy activities.</p><p>- Commissioning, in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy, the first public performance at the UN General Assembly of a new work of poetry by Eavan Boland (&ldquo;Our Future Will Become The Past of Other Women&rdquo;) to mark the centenary of women&rsquo;s suffrage in December 2018;</p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s participation (by video) in the 2 December 2018 'Global Citizen Mandela 100' concert; and</p><p>- A public consultation to help shape Ireland&rsquo;s new diaspora policy is currently taking place around the country, and to encourage public awareness of these events taking place my department has promoted these events on Facebook.</p><p>- The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, on 28 February.</p><p>2019<table><tr><th>Campaign Details and dates</th><th>Company</th><th>Cost</th></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals </td><td>PHD (Social media and online) </td><td>&euro;7,127.78</td></tr><tr><td>Getty Ireland Brexit Ready </td><td>PHD (Twitter, internet and search optimisation) </td><td>&euro;108,787.64</td></tr><tr><td>St Patrick's Day </td><td>PHD (Social media) </td><td>&euro;9,181.60</td></tr><tr><td>Simon Cumbers Media Fund &amp;amp; &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;</td><td>Facebook &amp;amp; Twitter</td><td>&euro;663.25</td></tr><tr><td>A New Diapora Policy for Ireland </td><td>Facebook  </td><td>&euro;400.02</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;126,160.29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals</td><td>Twitter &amp;amp; Facebook </td><td>&euro;1,392.00</td></tr><tr><td>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready  </td><td>PHD (Social media, internet and search optimisation) </td><td>&euro;52,760.41</td></tr><tr><td>UN Security Council Campaign </td><td>PHD (Social media)</td><td>&euro;9,641.17</td></tr><tr><td>Global Ireland</td><td>PHD (social media) </td><td>&euro;5,837.80</td></tr><tr><td>D/FAT Missions</td><td></td><td>&euro;93.09</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;69,724.47</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>D/FAT Missions</td><td></td><td>&euro;113.60</td></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals</td><td>Facebook &amp;amp; Twitter</td><td>&euro;5,821.54</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;5,935.14</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Consular Division - Travelwise </td><td>Facebook</td><td>&euro;4,000.00</td></tr><tr><td>DFAT Missions </td><td></td><td>&euro;3,578.28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>&euro;7,578.28</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Agenda items for our consultations included our bilateral political and economic relations, as well as a range of regional and international issues such as the situation in Ukraine, Syria, Iran, the Middle East Peace Process, Iran, non-proliferation, the Council of Europe, human rights, cyber-security, disinformation, and Brexit. </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the EU strategy of maintaining dialogue with Russia on issues of mutual interest. Ongoing engagement with Russia bilaterally and in multilateral fora such as the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and through EU-Russia dialogue on key global challenges as well as regional conflicts is critical, especially where it can contribute to a relationship with a Russia that is underpinned by a commitment to the rule of law and international standards.</p>  <p>  We discussed the outcome of the 12th Plenary Session of the Ireland-Russia Joint Economic Commission, held in Moscow on 10 April 2019. The JEC is a bilateral Government to Government entity which promotes economic and trade activity between the two countries within six working groups comprising of Education and Training; ICT/High Technology; Agriculture and Food; Energy and Renewable Energy; Aviation and Transport, and Trade and Economic Cooperation. The Irish delegation in April was led by Minister of State Cannon and included officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Education and Skills; Business, Enterprise and Innovation, along with Enterprise Ireland and Sustainable Food Systems Ireland. At my meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov we noted the encouraging economic growth in our bilateral trade, which rose by more than 30% in 2018, and the prospects for further development of bilateral trade in education services, agriculture, transport, innovation and the digital economy.</p></reply>

Attacks against civilians, including refugees and migrants, are totally unacceptable, and contrary to International Humanitarian Law. On 3 July, I issued a statement condemning the attack, and supporting the calls of the EU and the UN for an investigation into the facts of what may well constitute a war crime. </p>  <p>  All EU Member States have condemned in the strongest terms this attack in a statement issued on 5 July. EU Member States welcomed any fact-finding mission undertaken by the UN into the attack, called for an end to fighting in Libya, urged parties to return to the UN led mediation process, and reminded all Libyan parties of their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. EU Member States also expressed our readiness to urgently step up collective efforts to address the situation, and in particular, to improve protection and assistance to migrants and refugees. </p>  <p>  As I said in my statement last week, this tragic event underlines the fact that the system of detention centres in Libya is completely unsuitable for migrants, and puts them at risk. Ireland and the EU&rsquo;s position is that Libya&rsquo;s system of detaining migrants must end, and that migration must be managed in full compliance with international law. In the meantime, the EU has been working to provide life-saving support to migrants and refugees in detention. </p>  <p>  The EU has mobilised &euro;318 million under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa for the protection of migrants, refugees and internally displaced people in Libya, and to provide support to local communities to cope with the migration challenge. Throughout the conflict in Libya, the EU has cooperated with the UNHCR and IOM, which have staff on the ground in Libya, to provide protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants and refugees in detention centres and elsewhere. We have successfully evacuated refugees and migrants from detention centres near the frontline, and, where possible, have enabled them to find safety outside Libya, including in the Emergency Transit Mechanism in Niger, with a view to their resettlement. Through our cooperation with the UN and the African Union, the EU has helped over 45,000 migrants stranded in Libya to return to their countries of origin, and has evacuated close to 4,000 persons in need of international protection. However, many more people remain at risk, and the EU will continue to work with its partners to relocate them to safe places swiftly to receive assistance. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to access all areas where migrants are located, or to influence the situation on the ground. Ultimately, ensuring adequate treatment of migrants and refugees will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning Libyan Government. Ireland and the EU continue to support the efforts of the UN Special Representative, Ghassan Salam&eacute;, to bring this about.  All Libyans, and all international parties, should give their full support to the UN-led political efforts, and parties should ensure that they follow through on commitments made during the talks. This is the only way to ensure that civilians in Libya, including migrants and refugees, are protected.</p></reply>

The Passport Service issued over 780,000 passports in 2017, over 822,000 passports in 2018 and so far this year, over 490,000 passports have been issued. </p>  <p>  The increase in demand for Irish passports is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad and a growing population.  There has also been a significant increase in passport applications from applicants in Northern Ireland and in Britain since the UK Referendum on EU membership in June 2016.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been taken by the Passport Service to manage increases in demand in recent years including the recruitment of additional staff, the continuous implementation of technological and service improvements and the re-organisation of production processes and administrative arrangements.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the level of passport demand to ensure that all resources, including staffing, are effectively deployed to meet the ongoing anticipated strong demand for Irish passports. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, the Passport Service employed 363 Full Time Equivalent staff. This is an increase of over 40 staff since the same point in 2017. Already this year, over 90 additional Full Time Equivalent staff have taken up roles in the Passport Service. Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required. The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with queries from the general public. </p>  <p>  A new Customer Service Hub was established in January 2019 to ensure that the Passport Service is equipped to deal with the large volume of queries received through its phone and webchat services. The Passport Service is currently handling approximately 5000 calls and 3800 webchats per week. Thanks to this dedicated customer service team, we are able to quickly resolve most queries at the first point of contact. </p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award winning Online Passport Renewal Service was introduced in March 2017 and expanded in  November 2018 to allow for the renewal of children's passports and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. </p>  <p>  The online service brings significant benefits to citizens with faster turnaround times at a lower cost.  45% of all applications received in 2019 have been online applications and over 60% of those eligible to use the online application channel have done so. The online service has been instrumental in the efficient management of overall passport operations and in allowing the Passport Service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand. </p>  <p>  To assist with forecasting future demand for Irish passports, my Department has commissioned research to better understand the potential demand for passports from Irish citizens in the United Kingdom who have not yet applied for a passport. Interim reports have been provided and in 2019 an additional forecasting report was commissioned which sought to update and revise projected demand estimates up to mid-2023. This research will assist the Passport Service in formulating plans on resource requirements for the future.  </p></reply>

Ambassador Crawford then travelled to Ireland and presented his credentials to President Higgins on 01 July. My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan T.D., attended this ceremony on behalf of the Government, as did officials of my Department.</p>  <p>  While I have not yet had the opportunity to meet with Ambassador Crawford, I look forward to doing so in the near future. Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the US is one of our closest and most important. We share many common values, as well as a shared history, which allows for comprehensive engagement on a wide range of issues of mutual concern. In this regard, I look forward to meeting with the Ambassador to update him on a number of topical issues, including the Northern Ireland talks process, the challenges posed for the island of Ireland by the UK exit from the EU, and Ireland's role as a bridge between the US and the EU.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach met with Ambassador Crawford at the US Embassy Independence Day reception on the evening of 03 July last.  The Taoiseach took the opportunity to welcome Ambassador Crawford to Ireland and spoke with him about his work in the coming years.</p></reply>

The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. Revenue has referenced the original scope of its zero rating concession but acknowledged that the scope had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable and engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including health and nutrition experts as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward are evidence based. Officials in my department are considering the submissions received and the outcome will be presented to the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) on 9th July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards.</p></reply>

Following the decision of the UK in June 2016 to leave the EU, Revenue began a review of potential policy and operational implications and that work was undertaken within the then existing resources.</p><p>Budget 2017 provided Revenue with resources for an additional 40 staff to prepare for Brexit.  This included provision to upgrade ICT systems to manage the anticipated increase in Customs transactions; and for additional staff to put in place and to facilitate the necessary training and upskilling arrangements for staff still to be recruited. </p><p>In the context of extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work across all Government Departments and Agencies, Revenue determined that in a &lsquo;Central Case&rsquo; scenario (i.e. an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period until the end of 2020), an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required. In September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. </p><p>Budget 2019 provided Revenue with an additional &euro;10 million pay provision, for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019. Following a Government decision in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue&rsquo;s recruitment programme in preparation for Brexit. </p><p>Since the start of 2019, Revenue has appointed over 600 staff from open recruitment, interdepartmental and internal competitions. The majority of these have been assigned to customs roles or to backfill positions from which existing Revenue staff have been assigned to customs duties. As serving staff are taking up their new Brexit-related positions, Revenue is backfilling the vacancies created, from panels of candidates established in its general recruitment activity.</p><p>In the period from 2017 to date, Revenue has assigned over 450 additional staff to customs related roles, deployed across a range of functions, with the majority assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities and policy and operational roles. Resources are deployed based on the evolving business needs and to tackle any risks as they emerge.

Under the scheme an employer may provide an employee with a bicycle and/or cycle safety equipment without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation. However, where the expenditure by the employer exceeds &euro;1,000, the excess amount is liable to tax.</p>  <p>  The legislation only allows for one purchase of a bicycle in respect of an employee in a five-year period irrespective of whether the bicycle was used for the full period or not. It operates on a self-assessing basis using straightforward rules.  Any deviation from the current system would involve additional administrative procedures for either or both Revenue and employers in relation to the verification of loss, theft, insurance recovery, etc. As this runs counter to the existing provisions which are administratively simple, it would not be appropriate to alter the existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Anyone obtaining a bicycle under the scheme would therefore be advised to ensure it is covered by insurance.</p></reply>

Any gain arising on the transfer of the land is liable to CGT for the person making the disposal. The first &euro;1,270 of gains made by an individual in a tax year are exempt from CGT. </p>  <p>  Relief from CGT is available for a transfer of land by a parent to his or her child to enable the child to build a house on the land provided certain conditions are met. This relief does not apply to transfers between siblings.</p>  <p>  The transfer of land where no consideration has been paid for the land, or where any consideration paid was less than its full market value, could result in a gift tax liability for the sibling receiving the gift. For gift tax purposes, the relationship between the person who provides the gift and the person who receives the gift (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the life-time tax-free threshold - known as the Group threshold, below which inheritance tax does not arise. In the case of the gift between siblings, the Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a brother or sister of the disponer.  </p>  <p>   Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts which are in excess of their relevant tax-free threshold, gift tax at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax-free threshold.</p>  <p>  As the transfer of land constitutes both a disposal for CGT purposes and a gift for gift tax purposes, a credit is given for any CGT paid against a gift tax liability in respect of the same land.</p>  <p>  Stamp duty at the rate of 6% of the market value applies on the transfer of land. In this case the duty would be payable by the sibling receiving the land. However, there is a refund scheme in place in respect of the acquisition of land that is then developed for residential purposes.   A refund of up to 2/3 of the stamp duty paid may be claimed where a house is built on the land and other qualifying conditions for the relief are met.  A fixed timeframe for the commencement and completion of building work applies; construction work must commence within 30 months of the land being transferred and the house must be completed within two years of the commencement of construction.</p></reply>

The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply on property investment via a corporate vehicle.  Property rental income and gains arising are exempt from tax within the REIT and are taxed at the investor level when distributed through dividend withholding tax at 20%.  The legislation requires that 85% of all rental income profits be distributed annually to shareholders.  The REIT is subject to corporation tax on income and gains not arising from the property rental business of the REIT.   Distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities do not suffer the withholding tax as they are more generally exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, which derive 25% or more of its market value from assets deriving their value directly or indirectly from real estate in the State.  The IREF regime was introduced in Finance Act 2016 in response to concerns raised regarding the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property.  Investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  The regime provides, with some exceptions, that where a unit holder receives value from the IREF, an IREF withholding tax of 20% will generally apply.</p>  <p>  Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the tax regime applicable to special purpose companies set up to securitise assets.  Section 110 is designed to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation purposes.  Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets - real property, such as land and buildings, is not an asset that a qualifying company can hold.  They can however hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value from Irish land and buildings.  Amendments were made to the taxation of section 110 companies in Finance Act 2016 to address the issues relating to the taxation of Irish property.  The changes related to the taxation of qualifying companies which held loans that derived their value from Irish land.  The effect of these changes was to ensure that profits generated from Irish real estate remain within the charge to tax.</p>  <p>  With regard to acquisitions of property by institutional investors, an investment strategy which includes the purchase (including by forward-funding) of an entire apartment block or development inevitably creates an impression that the investment is disproportionate to other activities in the market, particularly the activities of private home buyers.  However this needs to be seen against a background of still muted supply in the property market and a continuing shortage of rented residential accommodation. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, while the role of institutional investors is growing, particularly in the urban apartment market segment, it is still minor in proportion to the total rental sector.  Data provided to my Department by the Residential Tenancies Board for May 2019 shows that the rented residential accommodation market is still dominated by small landlords.  The majority (over 70%) of landlords registered a single rental tenancy, with over 96% of landlords registering 5 tenancies or less.  Landlords with 5 tenancies or less account for almost 72% of all registered tenancies.  The top 21 landlords account for 3.11% of all registered tenancies.  The percentage of landlords with 20 or more tenancies has decreased from 0.52% in 2017 to 0.43% in 2019.</p>  <p>  Institutional investors have an important role to play in increasing property supply and I am satisfied that tax regimes which apply taxation at the level of the investor are appropriate to collective investment vehicles of this nature.  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis.  In this context, the Deputy may be aware, as part of the 2018 Finance Bill process I committed that my officials would undertake a report on REITs, IREFs and Section 110 companies as they invest in the residential property market.  This report to be presented to the Tax Strategy Group this month. </p></reply>

This is directed to my Department. </p>  <p>  The previous car scrappage scheme operated from January 2010 to July 2011.  VRT relief of up to &euro;1,500 was available upon registration of a new vehicle, subject to the scrappage of a qualifying old vehicle.  The VRT relief was provided where a new category A, or passenger car of emissions band A or B with CO2 emissions of 140g/km or lower was purchased and registered and an old car scrapped.</p>  <p>  To qualify for relief, the scrapped vehicle must have been registered in the State in the name of the purchaser of the new car for at least 18 months previous to the date of scrappage;  and on the day of scrappage been ten years old or more from the date of first registration. </p>  <p>  The current situation is different.  There are currently significant Government-backed incentives in place for electric vehicles including VRT relief of up to a further &euro;5,000.  Based on this existing relief, a person purchasing an electric vehicle with an Open Market Selling Price of under &euro;36,000 would currently pay no VRT.  This suggests that any car scrappage scheme that was based on the provision of VRT relief would be ineffective because no VRT is paid on the registration of most Battery Electric Vehicles to begin with.  The principal effect of any such VRT relief would be to gift taxpayers money to reduce the acquisition costs for buyers of higher end BEVs.   In that regard it is unlikely that there would be high volume of motorists with 10 year old cars who would be in the market for higher end Battery Electric Vehicles.    </p>  <p>  In addition, the market is more complex than in 2010 with the emergence of PCPs as a popular method of acquiring a car for use and potentially purchasing it.  The default position is that the legal owner of the vehicle, generally the car financing company, would be the direct beneficiary of any such VRT relief.</p></reply>

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database.  The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplements was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector.  The scope had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated.</p>  <p>  After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including commissioning an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Budget 2020, including the opening of a public consultation.  Revenue decided to extend the date of the removal of the zero rating from March to November 2019, to allow for the enactment of any potential legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  The public consultation in relation to the appropriate VAT rate for food supplements closed on 24 May. </p>  <p>  Officials in my department are reviewing the submissions received and the outcome of this review will be presented to a meeting of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) on 9th July.   The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards.</p></reply>

The rate was designed to be temporary, but was maintained in subsequent Budgets.  In 2016, the Programme for Partnership Government committed to maintaining the 9% VAT rate, dependent on prices remaining competitive in the sector.  I decided in Budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate.  However, I accepted that the rate must be subject to analysis.  In this context, I asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018, in order to better inform any decision in relation to the 9% reduced rate going forward.   In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, and impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looked at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.</p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure was more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sector remains strong.  The Review concluded that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector.  The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners also published a report on the 9% VAT Rate in June 2018 which analyses the output and employment impact of the 9% VAT rate using Revenue data.  The analysis found an estimated increase in employment of on average 1.8 employees for each firm benefitting from the reduced rate in the accommodation and food sector in the year following the introduction of the reduced rate.  However, beyond the short term, they were unable to distinguish the impact of the rate on employment from the impact of other factors in the economy.</p>  <p>  Given the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, there does not seem to currently be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase.</p>  <p>  However, in noting that changes made in Budget 2019 may present a challenge to the tourism and hospitality sector, an extra &euro;35 million was allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to provide more targeted supports.  This allocation includes targeted supports of &euro;4.5 million for regional initiatives such as Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic Way, and nearly &euro;10 million for the development of greenways.</p></reply>

Papers on various options for tax policy changes are prepared annually by officials.  The TSG is not a decision-making body and the papers produced are simply a list of options and issues to be considered in the Budgetary process.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to budgetary reform including greater engagement with the Oireachtas, the Tax Strategy Group papers are now published in advance of the Budget to facilitate informed discussion.  It is my intention that publication of the Papers online will take place shortly after the annual meeting of the Tax Strategy Group.  Therefore I would expect publication before the end of July.</p></reply>

In accordance with Irish VAT legislation, oral medicines (for human consumption), licensed/authorised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, are liable to VAT at the zero rate.  Ireland&rsquo;s application of the zero rate of VAT to oral medicines derives from the derogation under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive.  Under that provision, Ireland may retain the zero rate on goods and services which was in place on 1 January 1991.  As oral medicines were liable to the zero rate of VAT on that date, Ireland continues to apply this rate but may not extend its scope.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as nicotine patches cannot be considered an oral medicine there is no discretion, under the Directive, to zero rate these products.</p></reply>

As a result, a jointly assessed couple where one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of this payment is considered to be a dual income household and, thus, entitled to an increase in the standard rate band of the lesser of &euro;26,300 or the income of the lower earner.  This means that the maximum joint standard rate band a couple can have is &euro;70,600 (&euro;44,300 + &euro;26,300), which is the equivalent of double the single earner rate band.  However, it is not possible for one spouse or civil partner to have the full extended rate band of &euro;70,600- an individual can have no more than &euro;44,300. </p>  <p>  If a couple decide to opt for the home carer credit instead of the increased standard rate band, the carer spouse or civil partner may earn up to &euro;7,200 per year without affecting the amount of the credit awarded.  However, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is not taken into account when calculating the income of the carer spouse or civil partner for the purposes of the &euro;7,200 income threshold.  In other words, if the only income of the carer spouse or civil partner is Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, there will be no reduction in the home carer credit due to that spouse or civil partner. </p>  <p>  Revenue will apply whichever relief is the most beneficial for the couple concerned.</p></reply>

Interpretation of this legislation evolves on a continuous basis, as a result of judgements handed down by Irish courts and, ultimately, the CJEU.  Revenue continuously reviews its interpretation of VAT legislation in line with these judgements.  In addition, the European Commission may challenge any Member State where they take the view that the VAT treatment of particular transactions or activities by a Member State are not in accordance with the VAT Directive.</p>  <p>  The Directive does not specify the rate of VAT applying to the supply of every known product or service; it provides a framework for the application of rates to broad categories of goods or services.  Within this framework there is room for differing interpretations of the legislation as to the rate of VAT applying to specific goods or services.  In particular this may happen following the development of new goods or services.  In these circumstances, Revenue and taxpayers interpret the law as it stands and if taxpayers disagree with Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation they can appeal the matter to the Tax Appeal Commissioners and ultimately to the CJEU. </p>  <p>  VAT legislation does not apply the zero rate of VAT to food supplements but shortly after the introduction of VAT Revenue applied a concessionary zero rating to certain vitamin, mineral and fish oil products.  As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils, and these rulings were published in Revenue&rsquo;s VAT rates database.  The scope of the relatively narrow original zero rating of food supplement products permitted by Revenue broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated.  After undertaking a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products.  The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward are evidence based.  The results of the consultation will be included in the 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group paper as part of the Budget 2020 process.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that it is unable to provide information on the number of instances in which it advised taxpayers over the years 2011 to 2017 that particular food supplement products were zero rated. </p></reply>

Decisions in this regard, as well as the criteria used to decide the make-up of loans to be included, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.  The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.  These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p><p>It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale, either by way of securitisation or otherwise, remain unchanged.  Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  </p><p>Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo; including the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 14) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 (&lsquo;the SME Regulations&rsquo;).  This ensures that consumers whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale.</p><p>In regards to the overdraft issue, my response to your PQ in April (17964/19) advised that when overdrafts were being converted into a loan facility and transferred to a Retail Credit Firm customers had the right to appeal the withdrawal of the overdraft facility to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  However in this case the company has not appealed and the bank (as per the letter you supplied) has confirmed that the company may apply for a new facility.  Should this application be unsuccessful then the company has the right to appeal the bank's decision to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  The CRO is able to review cases where credit facilities up to &euro;3m are refused, withdrawn, or offered on unreasonable conditions.  Details of how to appeal to the CRO can be found on the website <i>www.creditreview.ie. </i></p></reply>

The different treatment of VAT as regards petrol and diesel relates to the VAT input deductibility entitlement of VAT registered taxpayers.  Businesses who make supplies that are charged to VAT are entitled to claim input VAT on their business expenses.  VAT registered persons are entitled to claim the cost of VAT on the purchase of diesel used in the course of their business, as is the case with most business costs.  However, section 60 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits VAT deductibility by businesses on certain goods and services which, by their ubiquitous nature, are not easily distinguishable from general non-business use.  This is for anti-avoidance reasons.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on petrol, as well as expenditure on food, drink, accommodation, and entertainment, is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the petrol or other goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business.  </p>  <p>  Under Article 176 of the EU VAT Directive, Ireland can retain certain restrictions on VAT deductibility that were in place before 1979.  As VAT input deductibility has been restricted on petrol since 1972, Ireland can retain that block on deductibility.  While it is legally possible to apply the normal rules of VAT deductibility to petrol, once the block on deductibility is eased or removed it would not be possible to re-introduce it.  There is a case for petrol and diesel to be treated equally in terms of input deductibility entitlements as there is a greater level of diesel-run personal motor vehicles in operation today than in the past.  However, the provisions of Article 176 prohibit the application of a new deductibility restriction on diesel expenditure.  As anti-avoidance concerns regarding petrol expenditure deductibility continue, the restriction on VAT deductibility remains valid.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that items of expenditure such as the value of petrol purchases are not separately identified on VAT or self-assessed tax returns.  Therefore, an estimate of the cost of allowing VAT registered, self-employed persons to reclaim VAT on petrol purchased for business purposes is not available.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  </p><p>WTO rules and EU Directives on public procurement require that public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria.  For works contracts, the threshold is &euro;5,548,000; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments, the threshold is &euro;144,000 and for the remainder of public bodies, the threshold is &euro;221,000.  The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;443,000.For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.</p><p>In addition, the Office of Government Procurement developed Circular 10/14 which is aimed at facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises in competing for public procurement opportunities.  In this regard, the following national rules apply to below EU threshold procurements:</p><p>- All public contracts for supplies and services with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) and upwards should be advertised on the national public procurement website,<i>www.etenders.gov.ie.</i></p><p>- The advertising threshold for works is set at &euro;50,000 (exclusive of VAT).</p><p>- Suppliers of goods and services and especially the SME sector are encouraged to register on the e-Tenders website and avail of its facilities including receiving automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities.</p><p>It is worth noting that these thresholds were reviewed last year in consultation with the SME Advisory Group, chaired by my colleague, Minister of State O'Donovan, which is comprised of representatives from IBEC, SFA, CIF, ISME and Chambers Ireland and it was recommended that the national thresholds remain at the current levels.  The main reasons for setting the national thresholds at these levels is to open up public procurement opportunities to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and to achieve value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money through competitive and transparent tendering processes.  It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used. </p><p>These thresholds for advertising on eTenders will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities, particularly the SME sector.</p></reply>

Primary legislation was necessary in order to bring that change into effect.  It was made clear at the time that until such legislation was enacted, the compulsory retirement age of 65, which applied to the vast majority of this cohort, remained in effect and pre-2004 public servants reaching that age would be required to retire.</p><p>Interim arrangements were provided for the cohort of public servants who reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 after the Government Decision because, while they would be aware of the Government&rsquo;s decision, they would be unable to avail of it.  Those arrangements permitted these individuals to be rehired post-retirement for a period of 1 year until they reached the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory).  Without that specific arrangement, they would have been required to cease working on reaching the age of 65.</p><p>The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 was enacted on 26 December 2018.  Under the Act, any relevant public servant who had not already reached their compulsory retirement age of 65 before that date has a new compulsory retirement age of 70.  Enactment of the legislation had no effect on those public servants who retired at 65 prior to the 26 December 2018 and who availed of a one year contract under the interim arrangements.  </p><p>Section 3 of the 2018 Act also provides that I, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, within three months of the passing of the Act, would prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants who were forced to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  This Report was laid before the Oireachtas on 26 March 2019 and is publicly available on the <i>www.gov.ie</i>website and in the Oireachtas Library online catalogue.  A total of approximately 1,928 public servants are included in the ambit of the report; approximately 646 of whom availed of the interim arrangements.  </p><p>Having considered all of the issues outlined in the Report, I am satisfied that the interim arrangements  were an appropriate temporary policy response at the time of the Government Decision, pending enactment of the legislation.  The terms of those arrangements were clear, unambiguous and made known to those who availed of them.  Accordingly, for the reasons set out in the report, I decided not to make any changes to those terms.</p><p>The contract terms for the interim cohort continue to apply and they cease working when they reach the age of 66, as previously provided.  </p></reply>

The implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  </p><p>The main findings of the Report, which have been accepted by Government, include:</p><p>- An increase of 10% in the Military Service Allowance which is a unique payment to the Defence Forces and paid to the majority of ranks. The overall annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;4.8m p.a.</p><p>- Restoration of a 10% reduction in respect of duty allowances such as Security Duty Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance that were introduced under the Haddington Road Agreement.  The 10% cuts to overseas allowances will also be restored.</p><p>- The overall estimated cost of the restoration of these measures is &euro;3.3m p.a.</p><p>- Restoration of premium weekend payment rates which were approximately halved under the Haddington Road Agreement.

The other school closed on 30 June 2019, when the last group of pupils completed sixth class.  From the outset it was clear that the Trustees of the school, the De La Salle Brothers, planned to sell the school property in which the latter school was located and accordingly the property would not be made available under the patronage divesting process.  According to Department records, my Department does not hold any legal interest, such a charging lease, over the property.<b></b></p><p>The Programme for Government commits to increasing the number of multi-/non-denominational schools to 400 such schools by 2030. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has developed the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity process to deliver on this commitment through patronage transfer, in line with the choices of local parents and school communities.  The process involves the transfer of live schools and has the potential to significantly increase patronage diversity in our school system. </p><p>In addition to the main provisions of this process, the &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; provision enables school communities which have already decided to seek a transfer of patronage (independent of the survey process) to request that their existing patron makes an application to the Minister for a direct transfer of patronage under section 8 of the Education Act.  I encourage any school community which is seeking a transfer of patronage to make contact with their school patron in this regard.</p><p>While the new structures to support the schools reconfiguration for diversity process are being introduced, my Department will continue to work to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, including the areas referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the school should have a formal complaints procedure that can be followed. This procedure should set out what a parent may have to do and how long it should take to deal with a complaint.  The role and responsibilities of the principal and board of management should also be set out. The complaint procedures currently operated by most schools are the standard procedures that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies and a copy should be provided by schools to a parent on request. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan on Bullying, which was published in January 2013, sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. As part of the implementation of the Action Plan my Department published new anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools at the beginning of the 2013/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaints procedures.</p>  <p>  Where a parent is of the view that a school's board of management has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, they should bring the matter to the attention of the patron.  In the event that, after raising its concerns with the school patron, a parent still considers that the matter has not been resolved, it is open to the parent to raise the matter with the Ombudsman for Children. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may also independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills provided the parent has fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my Department has been working on the drafting of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. </p>  <p>  Under the Bill, each school will be required to prepare, publish and implement a Student and Parent Charter in accordance with national guidelines to be published by the Minister after consultation with the education partners, including those bodies representing parents. </p>  <p>  The key aim of the legislation is to improve how schools engage with students and their parents. Schools will be required to respond to feedback and comments from students and parents where appropriate on matters relating to the school, including as appropriate in relation to their anti-bullying policy.</p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for the development of new complaints procedures in schools to ensure that grievances of students or their parents relating to the school are dealt with efficiently, effectively, fairly and consistently across schools. </p>  <p>  Subject to Government approval, I intend to publish the Bill in the Autumn.</p></reply>

Currently, under the terms of the Initiative, the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution. The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course</p>  <p>  The Student Contribution, which currently stands at &euro;3,000, was introduced by my Department with effect from the 2011/12 academic year replacing the previous Student Services Charge. It should be noted that there has been no increase in the Student Contribution since the 2015/16 academic year.</p>  <p>  Measures are in place to assist students and their parents in meeting the cost of the Student Contribution.  Almost 50% of full-time undergraduate students have all, or part of, the contribution paid by the State on their behalf through the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  Students may also be requested by their respective institutions to pay an additional student levy. The determination of the level and payment of such levies are a matter for the institutions themselves and are not collected centrally by my Department.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief provisions are also available so that second and subsequent siblings do not have to bear the full cost of the Student Contribution. Full details are available form the Revenue Commissioners. </p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on the 18th July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware, the Government announced plans in April 2018 for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new 800 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Kilcoole and Greystones school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  A major building project for St. David&rsquo;s Holy Faith Secondary School in Greystones is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning and will provide an extension and refurbishment to the existing school along with a new two-storey Physical Education Hall and ancillary accommodation to accommodate a long term projected enrolment of 750 pupils. This will provide an additional 180 post-primary places in the Greystones school planning area.</p>  <p>  In addition, a major building project for Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann in Kilcoole will provide an extension and refurbishment to the existing school to accommodate a long term projected enrolment of 800 pupils, providing an additional 85 post-primary places in the Kilcoole school planning area.</p>  <p>  It is also open to existing schools in the Greystones school planning area to apply for additional temporary accommodation should this be required.</p></reply>

However, in December 2018, a campaign promoting teaching as a career was developed in conjunction with the Government Information Service (&euro;132,991) in which digital media was utilised as a platform.</p>  <p>  In addition, during 2018, my Department worked with other bodies on a  number of other high profile campaigns aimed at raising awareness among the teaching profession and learners on specific initiatives including a national STEM awareness campaign (&euro;78,965); online safety campaign in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach (&euro;21,051); awareness raising Campaign (Promotion of Foreign Languages as part of Ireland's Foreign Languages strategy) which was implemented by Post-Primary Languages Initiative (PPLI) (&euro;350,000). Each of these campaigns had some digital marketing element. The breakdown of the specific digital marketing element is not available as the marketing and advertising campaigns were managed by the relevant organisations.</p>  <p>  All of the spend above related to raising awareness or driving action for the relevant policy initiatives. No amount was targeted abroad.

Section 21 of the Technological Universities Act 2018, provides for the making of rules from time to time  by the HEA, with the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance. The Department is considering funding issues for TUs, including in relation to borrowing arrangements and in the broader context of the provision of purpose built student accommodation (PBSA). The Department is consulting, as appropriate, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.</p>  <p>  In February 2019 the Department established an independently chaired high level working group, the Technological University Research Network (TURN), comprising representatives from the Department, the Technological Higher Education Association, the Higher Education Authority, TU Dublin and the 3 current TU development consortia. TURN is examining a number of key issues for the future development of TUs including integration challenges, best practice in relation to management structures, organisational work practices and the funding model for TUs, including issues such as borrowing arrangements. It is envisaged that the outcome of the TURN process will be of benefit to TU consortia and established TUs in driving their strategic development and the achievement of organisational, sectoral and national priorities for higher education and regional and national development. The work of TURN is expected to inform the consideration of areas in which investment in TUs may underpin their effectiveness and success, including issues such as borrowing arrangements for TUs. TURN is expected to report to the Minister for Education and Skills later this year.</p>  <p>  In broader policy terms, the National Student Accommodation Strategy (NSAS) complements the initiatives being taken by the Minister for Housing to increase housing supply under Rebuilding Ireland.  The strategy outlines 8 key targets and 27 actions which are designed to support the delivery of an increased level of supply of PBSA.  The target as set out in the NSAS is the provision of 7,000 bed spaces by end 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional PBSA beds by 2024.</p>  <p>  As of the end Q1 2019:</p>  <p>- 6,362 PBSA bed spaces had been completed since the launch of Rebuilding Ireland</p>  <p>- 6,007 further bed spaces were under construction</p>  <p>- 6,005 additional bed spaces had planning permission granted</p>  <p>- 2,880 were at the planning permission application stage.</p>  <p>  In total these developments combine to 21,254 PBSA bed spaces, demonstrating strong growth in the sector and enhancing the mix of accommodation available to students during a time of accommodation shortage in the general rental sector.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.</p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.</p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.</p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.</p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

All schools at both Primary and Post Primary are being assessed using the new identification model.</p>  <p>  This analysis is being carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. Work is ongoing by this group, including consultation with relevant experts. I am confident that the culmination of this analysis will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need.</p>  <p>  Until this analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p>  <p>  The DEIS advisory group (which includes school management bodies and unions) was briefed in May by officials from my Department on progress and it is intended to schedule a further meeting of the DEIS advisory group for October this year.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In general children are eligible for school transport if they meet the distance criteria and are attending their nearest school.</p>  <p>  In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.  If the family has further information in regard to the closest school being full they should contact School Transport Section of my Department. Further information in this regard is available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Children who are eligible for school transport but for whom no service is available may be offered the Remote Area Grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who complete the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. Where the number of applications from ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, tickets are allocated using an agreed selection process. Only children who are eligible for school transport and who hold valid Medical Cards are exempt from paying the annual charge.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the child in question is not eligible for school transport as he is not attending his nearest school and the family should liaise with their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office if they wish to enquire about the availability of school transport on a concessionary basis for the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  The terms of the School Transport Schemes are applied equitably.</p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department will seek to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of a survey.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken. </p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of the pupils instanced in the Deputy's question these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school they are attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation, including the appropriateness of psychological assessment,  with the school's assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

Special Education teachers support the mainstream class teacher by providing additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in schools.</p><p>- Approximately 1,600 special classes in mainstream schools for the 2019-20 school year. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) continues to engage with schools in relation to opening special classes where there is an identified need for special class provision.</p><p>- Included in the above special class total are 63 Specific Speech and Language Disorder special classes in mainstream primary schools</p><p>- 124 special schools providing specialist education for pupils with the most complex special needs.</p><p>- The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>- The NCSE Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for support teachers, continuing professional development for teachers, and support to schools on the management of challenging behaviour. </p><p>- National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) delivers a consultative, tiered service delivery model to schools, in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils/students in schools.  This service delivery model allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support to meet the needs of pupils/students.</p><p>- Assistive technology/specialised equipment where it is essential in order for students to access the curriculum, in accordance with the criteria as set out in DES Circular 0010/2013</p><p>- Enhanced capitation for special schools and special classes. </p></reply>

The Department has no preference from an educational perspective for one-on-one provision. </p><p>Subject to conditions, Parents are free to use the grant to engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or pre-school providers to deliver tuition in a group / pre-school setting. Such arrangements are essentially between the parents and the relevant provider. </p><p>There are many reasons why parents might prefer grouped arrangements rather than home based provision. These include the social benefits that arise for children working in an environment with other children. My Department advises all parents of the option to enter into a group arrangement</p><p>Private pre-school providers or home tutors do not provide services on behalf of the Department and the Department has no contractual relationship with such providers.</p><p>The annual circular which outlines the terms and conditions of the Home Tuition Grant Scheme will shortly be available on my Department&rsquo;s website for the 2019/2020 school year. </p></reply>

This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the college attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

These schools receive a grant in lieu of fees that had been levied prior to 1967.  An additional per capita grant is paid to secondary schools in the voluntary sector in which instruction is through the medium of Irish in full or in part.  The grant is not paid in either the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive or the ETB sectors.</p>  <p>  Financial allocations to the ETB sector are made on a budget basis in respect of head office and other costs, including those relating to schools.  ETBs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets and each ETB is allowed to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.  Any funding issues for an individual school have to be managed from within the relevant ETB's budget.  The Department does not earmark funding allocations for individual schools in the ETB sector. </p>  <p>  The Department's Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022 aims to ensure the availability of a high quality and relevant Irish-medium educational experience for all young people living in Gaeltacht areas and in this way to support the use of Irish as the main language of families and of Gaeltacht communities.  Under the terms of the Policy, additional teaching and/or other resources, including dedicated continuing professional development (CPD), will be made available to schools whose applications to participate in the Gaeltacht Schools' recognition process are approved.  It is envisaged that the allocation of resources will be on a staged incremental basis over a five-year period and will take account of the resources already allocated to each newly recognised Gaeltacht school in accordance with the language criteria set out in the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022.</p></reply>

The audit found that grant funding provided from Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, based in my Department had been used to supplement funding provided to this organisation from other sources to fund other work not coming under Cosc's remit.  This irregularity was found to have arisen due to lax financial controls in the organisation in question.  The audit did not find any evidence of any fraudulent activity. </p>  <p>  On foot of the audit's findings, the Department is currently engaged in a process to resolve the issues raised by the internal audit report.  The process includes the engagement of suitably qualified external resources by the Department to advise on future action.  Once this independent analysis has been received, which is expected during the third quarter of this year, a prompt decision will be taken by the Department on how to proceed regarding these matters.  The outcome will be notified to the Public Accounts Committee.</p>  <p>  The Public Accounts Committee was advised in April that the name of the organisation in question is not being put in the public domain.  The Committee was advised that the reason for this is firstly to protect the integrity of the process currently underway, but also to protect the organisation's clients from being potentially exposed otherwise to media attention and speculation not of their making, which would detract from the ongoing sensitive work being undertaken with them and on their behalf. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that, in its management and accountability for grants of this nature provided from exchequer funds, my Department adheres to the relevant Directive in place from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is applicable to all Government Departments in governing such funding.  This includes service level agreements with such organisations, periodic reporting on expenditure and periodic auditing of organisations. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer for my Department's Vote, reports formally to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee under the standard processes which are in place for the reporting on all Government expenditure.</p></reply>

In response, the Government has successfully brought forward a number of amendments to the Judicial Council Bill 2017 that will provide for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  The Committee will be tasked with the preparation of personal injuries guidelines and will have all the powers necessary for it to carry out its functions in an efficient and effective manner.  The Bill passed all stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4 July 2019 and is scheduled for completion before the Seanad today, Tuesday 9 July 2019, with a view to its enactment before the summer recess and the establishment of the Judicial Council before the end of the year. </p>  <p>  As also raised, the Cost of Insurance Working Group had called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard.  As I have outlined in my responses to a number of parliamentary questions during the current D&aacute;il session, the Garda Commissioner is of the view that a divisional focus on insurance fraud is preferable to the establishment of a centralised investigation unit.  This approach is aligned with the divisional-focussed Garda model.  It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  As Deputies will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is solely responsible for such organisational matters, including the establishment of individual Garda units, their remits and resourcing.  At the same time, there is now a broader positive engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Insurance Ireland's Anti-Fraud Forum who have committed to meet on a regular basis to discuss and act upon current and ongoing issues arising in the area of insurance fraud.</p></reply>

This provision includes funding to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) currently.  These projects are community-based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime/anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  For 2019, there is a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community.  This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11.  </p>  <p>   In additional to local projects, the Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.  The operation of GYDPs is being further developed through an Action Research Project, (ARP) supported by the University of Limerick, which is currently engaging with 15 local projects.  It is envisaged that the ARP will run over a number of years with a view to rolling out the learning to all GYDPs and developing the project network so that every child in the State who might require GYDP services will have access to them.</p></reply>

All digital spends have been primarily aimed at those living in Ireland.</p><p>The criteria by which target audiences are selected is based on identifying the group for whom the message is most relevant.  For example, the annual Fireworks Awareness Campaign takes place each Halloween.  The Department was concerned that the traditional method of newspaper advertisements may not be reaching those who may potentially be accessing illegal fireworks at this time of year and therefore has also begun engaging in online advertising targeted at persons under the age of 21 as they are the group for whom this information may be most relevant. </p><p>An itemised breakdown of digital marketing expenditure covering the last 8 years is set in the following table.  There was no expenditure for digital marketing before 2016.  <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Cost (&euro;)</th><th>Description</th><th>Private company (if applicable)</th></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;1,637.02</td><td>Fireworks Halloween Campaign - Trafficking fees/Facebook self-service</td><td>PHD Media Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;123.00</td><td>Fireworks Halloween Campaign - Online campaign MGMT </td><td>Mediavest Ltd.

These are civil legal aid and criminal legal aid.  In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question I can provide the following information in respect of each of these categories of legal aid:</p><p>Firstly, the provision of civil legal aid in the State is delivered by the Legal Aid Board pursuant to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2017.  The Board operates 30 full time law centres and a number of part time law centres in Ireland.  The Board also provides mediation services to help separating couples to negotiate their own agreement.</p><p>The majority of the Board's income consists of a grant received from my Department.  This funding is used to provide the Board's services in all its offices across the country, as well as the support services provided to law centres centrally from the Board's head office.</p><p>It is not possible to extract and isolate the total cost of civil legal aid in any one office/county in a given year as it would be necessary to devise a basis on which to attribute, to each county, all expenditure incurred by the Board centrally.  Complexities may also arise at local level with regard to the delivery of civil legal aid, for example a client living in County Limerick may choose to apply to Ennis Law Centre.  Also, in a case where two parties to a dispute seek the services of the Legal Aid Board at one law centre, one party will be required to engage with a different law centre, which may be in a neighbouring county.</p><p>Funding provided to the Legal Aid Board by my Department for the years 2015-2018 is provided in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Budget Allocation  <br /><br />&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>32.471</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>34.838</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>38.988</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>40.275</td></tr></table></p><p>In the case of criminal legal aid, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.</p><p>As in the situation with civil legal aid, statistics for criminal legal aid are not compiled in such a manner as to readily identify expenditure on a county by county basis<b>.</b></p><p>Expenditure on criminal legal aid in each of the years 2015 to 2018 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Expenditure <br /><br />&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;50.879</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;52.998</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;58.139</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;64.806</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The E-Commerce Act 2000 is dealt with by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  The Digital Single Market (DSM) agenda, led by my Department, is a whole of government approach coordinated across Government.  The Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) on the Digital Single Market, is chaired by my colleague Pat Breen TD, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection.  The key focus of the IDC is on ensuring effective whole-of-Government engagement with the EU DSM agenda.  The Department of Finance/Public Expenditure and Reform is represented on the IDC. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has responsibility for the Modernisation of VAT regimes for eCommerce.  In January 2021 new changes will come into effect on the existing VAT regime which will have a significant impact for E-commerce and high street retailers in general.  The main change will be the removal of the existing VAT exemption for goods from outside the EU with a value less than &euro;22.  This will mean that vendors (or online platforms facilitating the vendor) must charge the rate of VAT applicable in the country they are selling into.  This should address the cost advantages that non-EU vendors currently benefit from.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the one-stop shop for VAT registration of distance sales will be extended.  This will mean that online traders will no longer have to register for VAT for business-to-consumer transactions in each of the member states in which they sell, thereby reducing costs.  This will be a significant simplification and easing of the administrative processes involved in selling across the EU.  Together these changes should level the playing field for Irish companies and help them better compete both online and in the High Street.</p>  <p>  As set out in Future Jobs Ireland 2019, all businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s digital environment need to focus on building competitive online capability.  It is clear that the retail sector is undergoing an exciting but also challenging transformation as the digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond.  Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.  Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. </p>  <p>  The Retail Consultation Forum (RCF), which I chair, was established in 2014 to provide a platform for engagement between retail representative bodies, retailers and the public sector on key concerns for the retail sector.  The Department of Finance is represented on the RCF.</p>  <p>  As part of the Forum&rsquo;s work, the 'Framework for Town Centre Renewal' was launched in April 2017.  The Framework supports towns and villages through their Local Authorities to address the challenges of creating a vibrant and viable town centre.  It sets out the key characteristics of a successful town centre and identifies existing supports and best practice examples from around the country.  The Framework also serves as a support document for towns and villages applying for funding streams under Project 2040 including; the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which can be leveraged to support the regeneration and viability of town centres. </p>  <p>  As Chair of the RCF, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability and enhance their competitiveness.  In support of this, and through the Forum, I have introduced a new Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland.  The Online Retail Scheme supports retail businesses of 10 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability, with grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000 on a 50 percent match fund basis.  The second call for the Online Retail Scheme opened on 19th June and will close on 31st July this year. </p>  <p>  A sub-group of the RCF focusing on skills has worked to identify the key skills challenges facing retailers today and to identify practical proposals to address those challenges.  Digital skills were identified as a critical requirement along with marketing and logistics.  Forum member, Retail Ireland Skillnet, has since developed a retail specific digital course and will also, in September 2019, launch the first Apprenticeship in Retail Supervision.</p>  <p>  The agencies of my Department offer a range of supports to assist businesses with aspects of e-commerce.  Of particular relevance to the retail sector, the LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes which are available to high street retailers to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. </p>  <p>  In light of the continuing work of the Retail Consultation Forum and its focus on the current and future developmental needs of the retail sector, the ongoing whole of Government engagement on the DSM agenda, as well as the 2019 commitment under Future Jobs Ireland for my Department to commence a study to understand the full extent and impact of digital transformation on retail business models, I have no plans at present to establish a working group on e-commerce and high-street retail.</p></reply>

As a small, open, export-led economy, we very much support balanced international Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as they help to open up greater market access at reduced costs. </p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur deal was agreed in principle on 28th June after nearly 20 years of negotiations.  Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur.  This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that will allow a cross flow of trading and investment between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish products.</p>  <p>  Trade with the Mercosur region has grown by 19% in the period 2010 to 2016.  The EU-Mercosur Agreement will, we anticipate, allow Irish exporters to expand faster, and will open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.  In this regard, analysis by my Department has estimated that a potential doubling of annual goods and services exports from Ireland is possible over the period to 2030.</p>  <p>  However, I and my Government colleagues recognise and appreciate the very genuine concerns expressed by the farming community in relation to aspects of the EU-Mercosur deal, most notably the beef tariff rate quota.   </p>  <p>  The agreement reached on beef access is more than we had wished.  In that regard, I raised our concerns on our agricultural sensitivities at every opportunity at European Trade Council meetings.  I also raised it directly with the Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, including as recently as 31st May when I wrote to the Commissioner, once again, highlighting our serious concerns, particularly given the current challenges and uncertainty facing the Irish beef sector in light of Brexit.  Additionally, there has been a sustained effort right across Government in relation to this aspect, with both Minister Creed and the Taoiseach also raising this element at the highest levels, including joining Belgium, France and Poland in writing to the Commission President on the matter. </p>  <p>  The agreement that has been reached on this sensitive area is, however, far less than Mercosur had been looking for - some 300,000 tonnes &ndash; due to the Government&rsquo;s active campaign, with some other Member States, to secure the viability of the Irish and EU beef sector.  While the 99,000 tonnes that is in the deal is still higher than we want it to be, it is less than one third of what they originally sought.  It is also important to state that the 99,000 tonnes will be split into 45% frozen and 55% fresh and is &ldquo;Carcass Weight Equivalent&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Agreement also ensures that there will be equivalent food safety standards.  The EU&rsquo;s sanitary and phytosanitary standards will not be relaxed in any way, and they remain non-negotiable.  The highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods &ndash; especially food.  The EU will maintain its strict approach on GMOs and hormone beef, and its right to set maximum allowed levels for pesticide residues.</p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that there are positives for Ireland&rsquo;s food &amp;amp; drink sector in this deal.  One of Ireland&rsquo;s key offensive interests in the Mercosur deal is dairy, and the Agreement sees the removal of tariffs on 30,000 tonnes of cheese, 10,000 tonnes of milk powder, and 5,000 tonnes of infant formula on a reciprocal basis.  Furthermore, the Agreement provides for the protection of 335 Geographical Indicators (GIs) of EU origin &ndash; including Irish Whiskey and Irish Cream.  The acceptance of EU GIs will significantly improve protection of these products from false or misleading branding in Mercosur markets.</p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Agreement also sees the opening up of Mercosur&rsquo;s public procurement market - a market that was not previously available to EU firms.  It will make it easier for Irish firms to bid for, and win, valuable Government contracts in the four Mercosur countries, and the EU and Mercosur have agreed to apply modern disciplines based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, and fairness.</p>  <p>  There will also be special provisions for SMEs in the Agreement. SMEs will benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures &ndash; as the savings are proportionately greater for them.  A dedicated website will provide information on the Agreement for SMEs, practical guidance to importing and exporting will be published, and a dedicated data base of tariff reductions will be made available.  The simplification of regulations on standards will help with trade barriers encountered by SMEs.</p>  <p>  In relation to climate change, Mercosur including Brazil, will have to fully implement the Paris Climate Agreement as part of this deal, as well as meet specific commitments on reforestation. </p>  <p>  The Agreement also places particular emphasis on the development of trade between our two regions in a way that is conducive to decent work for all, including women and young people, with each party recognising the importance of core labour standards as defined by ILO Conventions.</p>  <p>  In light of the conclusion of the negotiations on 28th June, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is now ensuring that a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out specifically on the finalised EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement.  This assessment will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs, as well as the environmental implications of the deal.  It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might exacerbate/mitigate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy.  This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to the EU-Mercosur Agreement.</p></reply>

I am focused on supporting and sustaining existing regional employment while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland.  There are now nearly 230,000 people working in IDA client firms.  Last year saw more IDA-supported jobs added in regional Ireland than at any time over the past 17 years, with 58% of total such employment now located outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that when it comes to foreign direct investment (FDI), Drogheda is not being overlooked by the IDA.  Drogheda continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the International Business Services, Pharmaceutical and Technology sectors.  Last year saw PCI Pharma announce that 70 new jobs will be created at their facility in Drogheda.  In November 2017, Yapstone announced plans to create 200 new jobs over the next five years at their international headquarters in Drogheda.  These announcements represent a vote of confidence in what Drogheda and the broader North-East region has to offer to multinationals who are looking to locate outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  The IDA, for its part, continues to promote Drogheda to investors.  The Agency operates a Business and Technology Park in Drogheda with available land that is being actively marketed to existing and prospective clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. </p>  <p>  More broadly, County Louth has seen an almost 4% increase in FDI-driven employment in the last year.  There are now 28 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 3,903 people and these firms are continuing to grow and develop.  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Drogheda and County Louth, the Government remains determined to achieve more.  That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of the County.  The IDA remains pivotal to this and the Agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment there.</p></reply>

While there are many positive and rewarding aspects of caring, it is evident that caring is a significant challenge, affecting all aspects of a family carer&rsquo;s life. The needs of the cared for person can place great demands on the energy and time of the family carer, with many providing full time care, which can have a significant impact on their relationships with other people, their professional lives and their physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  The 2012 National Carers' Strategy represents a whole of Government response to the challenges faced by family carers and sets out the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government departments and agencies for carers. The Strategy is designed around a core vision which recognises and respects carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence and empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life. Oversight of the Strategy is led by the Department of Health, while the HSE&rsquo;s Multi Divisional Carer Strategy group continues to support the process across the service divisions to progress the actions in the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Funding has been secured through the Dormant Accounts fund for information and training supports for family carers. This is allowing family carers provide the best care possible to the care recipient, reduce the risk of injury to the carer and care recipient and helping family carers cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of their role. Funding is also being made available to provide for the dissemination of resource information for family carers, the development of support networks and support groups to assist with the transition back into social and economic life at the end of the caring role and measures that assist in promoting carer self-identification.</p>  <p>  Identifying carers and their needs as early as possible, is of critical importance to ensure they are supported in their caring role. The introduction of the Carers&rsquo; Needs Assessment Tool will be a key step in helping to identify carers at all stages and will also play a role in identifying the supports required.   The Department of Health secured Dormant Accounts funding to pilot the Carers&rsquo; Needs Assessment Tool in a HSE Community Health Care Organisation this year. This pilot study will greatly benefit the development of a comprehensive, standardised Family Carer Needs Assessment for identifying family carer&rsquo;s needs by providing an opportunity to refine and improve the needs assessment.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of a new statutory scheme for home-support services to enable people with care needs to live at home for as long as possible. Family carers were invited to participate in the public consultation carried out by the Department of Health in 2017, to which approximately 2,600 submissions were received. A report on the findings of the consultation was published in June 2018 and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. This will also inform the development of the new scheme. </p>  <p>  As part of the question relates to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Patients in Ireland can seek to be referred to another EU/EEA member state, including Northern Ireland, for medical treatment that is available in the public health service in Ireland. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the EU/EEA member state they choose to receive the service in. The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that at present there are no changes to patient care in the UK and Northern Ireland under the CBD, as the UK continues to be a full member of the EU. Indeed, until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full Member with all its existing rights and obligations.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as part of a whole of Government response to Brexit, my Department is working intensively to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of health services post-Brexit. This includes the enactment of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019. This legislation contains provisions which, if required, allows me to make Orders and Regulations to enable necessary healthcare arrangements to be maintained between Ireland and the UK in a Brexit no-deal scenario.</p></reply>

However, as part of the National  Contract for Consultants negotiated in 2008, some consultants holding specific contracts are entitled to engage in private outpatient practice outside of their public commitment and this commitment must be conducted on site, that is, in the  hospital they are contracted with. As a result, private outpatient clinics may  be held on the public hospital campus but these clinics must be held outside  contracted hours. The new children's hospital is obliged to provide such facilities for consultants holding such contracts. </p>  <p>  There are a total of 8 clinics off the main concourse of the new children&rsquo;s hospital. There are a suite of rooms within each clinic. Each of these clinics are identical in fit out.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that private care may be provided in one of these 8 clinics.

The risks identified relate to safety, fire safety management, layout, size, age, fixtures, fittings and lighting. Environmental risks were identified in relation to safe evacuation of patients. Elms Ward was found to have significant risk to patients and staff due to its uneven floor.</p>  <p>  To comply with legislative requirements, and in the best interests of patients and staff, the HSE needs to close the ward on a phased basis with effect from 1st July 2019, to be completed by August. This decision was based solely on health and safety concerns, and not as a cost saving measure.  There will be some reduction in access to transitional care beds from acute settings, however, all patients will remain in the Hospital until their current care is completed. The Department has been assured that all commitments for booked respite care will be honoured and plans are being put in place to that effect. </p>  <p>  Staff were advised of this decision through consultation with their line management and they will be reassigned within the Hospital. The HSE has advised the Department that significant capital is required to address the health and safety issues and part of the project development process will be to examine all options available to provide safe services.</p>  <p>  The primary focus must be on patients.  Engagement with them, their families, staff, union representatives and any other relevant stakeholders is on-going to ensure minimal impact for all concerned during the closure of the ward.</p></reply>

This additional funding supports a number of initiatives and capacity  building across the public health system. </p>  <p>  With regard to the use of diagnostic tools to tackle the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, Strategic Objective 5 of iNAP specifically identifies as an action, the need for assessment of the cost and clinical effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tools.</p>  <p>  In line with iNAP, HIQA was requested to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) of near-patient testing to guide antimicrobial prescribing.  In considering the scope of the HTA, antibiotic prescribing in  community settings was identified as an area where there was potential  to influence prescribing patterns using results of diagnostic testing.</p>  <p>  Following a scoping review, HIQA identified that CRP point-of-care  testing was the only test with evidence applicable to this scope and  hence, was the subject of the HTA.  The HTA focused on C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing for patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection in the primary care setting.  The HTA review and its findings relate to the clinical use of CRP point-of-care testing, the cost effectiveness, budgetary impact and the organisational issues associated with implementation.</p>  <p>  In line with the advice of the HTA, I have now asked my Department to engage with the HSE regarding the establishment of a pilot project.  This would allow for: evaluation of the CRP point-of-care testing in primary care settings; consideration of the sustainability of the benefits of testing; collection of data on costs; and examination of the organisational issues involved in implementing such a pilot project, specifically in the Irish healthcare context. </p></reply>

However, the HSE&rsquo;s 2019 National Service Plan commits to the full extension of service at St. Brigid's Hospice, Kildare this year and to opening three new inpatient units in Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow in quarter 4, with the latter three units expected to reach full capacity of 49 additional beds in 2020.</p>  <p>  A further three units are planned for development in the coming years, serving people with specialist palliative care needs in the Midlands and Border regions. Once these inpatient units are opened, there will be at least one hospice in every CHO region.</p></reply>

The 50 organisations included were agreed at the WRC by all parties.</p>  <p>  I asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented.  This exercise showed that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Following constructive engagement with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission, an agreement was reached on 2 October between the parties.  Pay restoration is now being processed and is commencing with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019 for those employed by the 50 organisations involved in the pilot.  Any outstanding balance will be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021.</p></reply>

The NTPF continues to welcome proposals from all acute hospitals for initiatives to improve access for patients awaiting outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  In terms of MRI waiting lists, the HSE advise that a pilot project was commenced in 2016 by the HSE Acute Hospitals Division to progress the collection of national radiology waiting list data. The project has been supported by the Radiology Clinical Care Programme and has involved key stakeholders across the system including the National NIMIS Team, Hospital Groups, and the support of the NTPF for data collection and data management expertise. At present, data is collected quarterly for MRI, CT and Ultrasound.  </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2019 which was published by my Department, includes a specific work stream on Access and Waiting Lists. Sl&aacute;intecare emphasises the need to invest in increased capacity while also shifting the balance of care from hospitals to community services for better health outcomes and a more sustainable health service. In addition, many of the other service reforms and enhancements included in Sl&aacute;intecare will support timely access to care for patients in the coming years.</p></reply>

The brand of levothyroxine in question does not have a marketing authorisation in Ireland.</p><p>Levothyroxine is a medicine used to treat a variety of different thyroid conditions. It is a medicine with a narrow therapeutic index, which means that small differences in dose or blood concentration may lead to changes in therapeutic outcomes or side effects. </p><p>In this case, the manufacturer of the particular brand of levothyroxine made changes to the inactive ingredients, also known as excipients, to increase the stability of the medicine and reduce potential variability in dosing. However, there have been reports of increased incidents of adverse drug reactions among patients who were changed to this new formulation in the Member States concerned. </p><p>None of the levothyroxine containing medicinal products granted a marketing authorisation in Ireland, and which are actively marketed here, have been subject to reformulation in recent years.</p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety, quality and effectiveness of medicines in Ireland, including reports of adverse drug reactions. This involves the operation of a national reporting system and inspection programme. Patients and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report suspected side effects, quality problems and other related issues through the HPRA website- <i></i></p><p>When new safety or quality information emerges the HPRA ensure that healthcare professionals are informed and when necessary new prescribing and dispensing advice is issued.</p><p>Patients taking levothyroxine-containing products should not stop taking their medicines. It is important that they continue to take their medicine as per their doctor&rsquo;s instructions. If any patient has any questions or concerns about any medicine that they are taking they are encouraged to speak with their doctor of pharmacist.</p></reply>

The risks identified relate to safety, fire safety management, layout, size, age, fixtures, fittings and lighting. Environmental risks were identified in relation to safe evacuation of patients. Elms Ward was found to have significant risk to patients and staff due to its uneven floor.</p>  <p>  To comply with legislative requirements, and in the best interests of patients and staff, the HSE needs to close the ward on a phased basis with effect from 1st July 2019, to be completed by August. This decision was based solely on health and safety concerns, and not as a cost saving measure.  There will be some reduction in access to transitional care beds from acute settings, however, all patients will remain in the Hospital until their current care is completed. The Department has been assured that all commitments for booked respite care will be honoured and plans are being put in place to that effect. </p>  <p>  Staff were advised of this decision through consultation with their line management and they will be reassigned within the Hospital. The HSE has advised the Department that significant capital is required to address the health and safety issues and part of the project development process will be to examine all options available to provide safe services.</p>  <p>  The primary focus must be on patients.  Engagement with them, their families, staff, union representatives and any other relevant stakeholders is on-going to ensure minimal impact for all concerned during the closure of the ward.</p></reply>

In 2018, the HSE granted &euro;12.68 million to Section 39 organisations who deliver respite, home care, day care, cognitive stimulation therapy, social clubs and supports for family carers.</p><p>In addition, 443 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages have been delivered to enable older people with dementia to remain in their own homes, since the introduction of these packages at the end of 2014.  </p><p>People with dementia are also able to avail of standard Home Support Services for Older People, on the basis of need and within the resources available.  A total of &euro;426 million has been allocated for home support services this year, delivering over 17.9 million home support hours to over 53,000 people.</p><p>In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered, including in those counties that currently do not have access to a dementia adviser.  The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website at . This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area.  </p><p>The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2020 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including any plans to expand the Dementia Adviser service, will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

I very much welcome their active engagement on the important issue of forestry and the environment and it is always encouraging when our young people show deep interest in these issues. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, it should be noted that the national forest estate now covers some 11% of the national land area of Ireland and is at its highest level in over 350 years.  The many benefits which forests provide are widely known and appreciated, including clean air and biodiversity as mentioned in the correspondence.  The recent Climate Action Plan also highlights the role of forestry in terms of carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The Government has consistently encouraged the planting of new forests through the provision of generous grants and premiums under successive Forestry Programmes. </p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the correspondents that forestry in Ireland operates within a strict legal and regulatory framework to protect forests and also to ensure that forestry operations and activities are carried out in compliance with the principles of sustainable forest management. There is an obligation under the Forestry Act, 2014 to  obtain a felling licence from my Department when removing trees from forests and to replant felled trees. </p>  <p>  There are certain instances where the felling of a tree is exempt from the need to obtain a tree felling licence, for example, trees near buildings or in an urban area. Certain bodies, such as local authorities and Waterways Ireland, are also  exempt from the requirement to have a felling licence for reasons such as the removal of trees in the performance of statutory functions. If a  person or organisation has concerns regarding incidents of tree felling by these bodies then they may consider contacting them directly.</p>  <p>  As regards the removal of hedgerows by farmers, all beneficiaries under the Basic Payment Scheme and other area based schemes, operated by my Department, must comply with the Statutory Management Requirements and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) standards set out in the relevant EU regulations.  There is a stipulation that hedgerows and trees in a line are designated as landscape features, and under GAEC 7, beneficiaries are obliged to retain and maintain such designated landscape features.  Hedgerows must be maintained and not allowed to become invasive.  Where, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to remove a hedgerow, remove a line of trees or fill in a drain for good reasons such as farmyard expansion, the farmers may do so provided the hedgerow, the line of trees or drain is replaced on a like-for-like basis. </p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been assigned powers commensurate with those of Authorised Officers under the Act.</p>  <p>  Land owners have responsibility to ensure appropriate fencing, boundaries, notices and signage are in place to control movement of stray equines. </p>  <p>  In the area of welfare, officials of my Department may intervene under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. In addition, local authorities are empowered to appoint officers of the Authority as authorised officers to enforce the Animal Health and Welfare Act within the Authority&rsquo;s functional area.</p>  <p>  My Department officials are aware of the situation in Holyhill to which the Deputy refers and, following inspection by a Department Veterinary Inspector, it has been confirmed there are no current welfare issues with the horses concerned.  Additionally, the situation is being monitored by the ISPCA who remain in contact with the local Department office.  </p>  <p>  My Department has also taken a proactive approach in tackling challenges that arise in the case of horses by developing facilities for both urban and traveller horse populations and in educating young people among these communities in the care and welfare of horses. Again, this work is done in close collaboration with the local authorities involved. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with Cork City Council with regard to the matter raised.</p></reply>

The lack of skilled labour within the agricultural sector is driving the need to find new and innovative ways to make our work practices easier and less time consuming. </p>  <p>  Under the current Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS), we have recognised the need to encourage the uptake of these innovations by providing funding across a number of new technologies. Funding for items such as GPS precision application systems for grassland and tillage crops, grant aided grass measuring equipment and financial support for the replacement of old technologies with new energy efficient equipment have all been included in the latest round of TAMS funding. Proto-type electric tractors remain under development and are not commercially available at present. </p>  <p>  The recently published All-of-Government Climate Action Plan to tackle climate breakdown also includes a series of measures to lower greenhouse gas emissions from transport. I am fully supportive of this plan and the actions within it. I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government to ensure successful implementation of the plan. I am also confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society with collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility being key in achieving this ambition and realising the potential of pro-active engagement.</p></reply>

These planting categories attract the highest grant and premium rates of all categories under my Department&rsquo;s afforestation scheme. The mid-term review of the Forestry Programme, completed early last year increased these rates even further in order to encourage more landowners to plant native trees. The premium is paid each year for fifteen years at a rate of &euro;665 per hectare. </p>  <p>  Other supports include two Woodland Improvement Scheme grants of &euro;750/ha and &euro;500/ha to thin forests at different stages of the forest development to ensure a healthy and sustainable forest and a very successful Forest Knowledge Transfer Scheme to promote a forestry culture and improve the forest management skills of private forestry owners in Ireland. Participants on the Forest Knowledge Transfer scheme are paid &euro;70 for attending each of the seven training modules. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme funds the protection and enhancement of existing native woodlands and, where appropriate, the conversion of conifer forests to native woodlands.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know that we also have in place a Woodland Environmental Fund which provides an opportunity for businesses to partner with the Government and Irish landowners to support the national effort to plant an additional 5 million native trees between now and 2020. This will result in an additional once-off top up payment of &euro;1,000 per hectare to participating landowners. </p>  <p>  I would encourage all landowners to consider forestry and in particular native woodlands as a land use option as these forests will become a long-lasting feature of our landscape, providing environmental benefits on an ongoing basis and adding colour and diversity to an area that can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike.</p></reply>

I have stressed the need for the Commission to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on the agri-food and fisheries sector. Avoiding a no-deal Brexit continues to be the Government&rsquo;s overriding policy priority.</p>  <p>  I am also keenly aware that the past few months have been very difficult for beef farmers in particular, following a difficult year for farm incomes in 2018 due to weather conditions. There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since last autumn, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The recent announcement by Commissioner Hogan of EU exceptional aid for the Irish beef sector is very welcome in this context.  I have been making the case for some time for an exceptional aid package from the EU Commission for Irish beef farmers, at EU Council of Agriculture Minister meetings, and in direct consultation with the Commission. The announcement by the Commissioner is another example of the importance of EU solidarity when it comes to facing significant economic challenges.</p>  <p>  This exceptional aid provision will be given effect through a Commission Implementing Regulation. While Member States were invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation (CMO) Management Committee, the Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and was not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content. The regulation was passed by the CMO committee last month and will now be enacted. Ireland must now notify the Commission, no later than 31 July 2019, of the measures to be taken in accordance with the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.</p></reply>

There are certain situations, pursuant to the Act, where the felling of a tree is exempted from the need to obtain a felling licence (e.g. within 30 metres of a building but excluding any building built after the trees were planted).  While it may be considered that some trees are exempted from the need to obtain a felling licence, my Department must still be notified that felling is to take place, and it will decide if the trees in question are exempted.  There are also certain common scenarios whereby the felling of trees is exempted and my Department does not need to be notified. Other legislation, such as the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, may include provisions to fell trees without the need to obtain a felling licence, so it is important to know the details of a situation before it can be determined if trees in a particular case are exempted or not.  </p>  <p>  It is, however, important to note an exemption from the requirement to obtain a Tree Felling Licence under the Forestry Act 2014 (as amended) and Forestry Regulations 2017 (as amended) does not absolve an applicant or developer from any requirement in law to obtain such other approvals, consents, licences, permissions and/or authorisations that may be necessary (e.g. under the Wildlife Acts). It is the responsibility of the land owner or the person felling the tree to ensure that they are acting within the law.</p></reply>

On 15 May 2018, the WTO Appellate Body found in favour of the US.   The EU challenged the awarded estimate and a WTO arbitrator is currently evaluating this claim and is due to report this summer. </p>  <p>  Separately, on 29 March 2019, the WTO's Appellate Body confirmed the European Union's position that the United States had failed to remove trade distorting subsidies in favour of Boeing.</p>  <p>  On 8 April 2019, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of European goods worth $11 billion that could be targeted with additional tariffs. The targeted items include cheeses, wine, and other food products as well as helicopters and aircraft.  In response, on 12 April, the EU published a list of potential countermeasures, with the amount of permitted EU countermeasures to be determined by a WTO-appointed arbitrator.</p>  <p>   On 7 July 2019, the USTR issued for public comment, a supplemental list of products to the original list of 8 April 2019 that could potentially be subject to additional duties. While USTR have stated that they are specifically targeting EU countries directly supporting Airbus in these measures, when the lists are reviewed, there are products that are exported from Ireland to the US, including dairy and beverages. This is most unwelcome and it is in Ireland's interest to find a solution to this issue. </p>  <p>  The European Commission, having competence in relation to trade matters, negotiates on behalf of Member States, including in relation to trade disputes.

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The funding paid to Bord na gCon to date this year is &euro;14.7m.  </p><p>My Department has a close working relationship with animal welfare charities and provides financial support to a number of animal welfare organisations through its ex-gratia animal welfare funding.  My Department provided funding of &euro;2,751,000 to animal welfare groups in 2018. The process of awarding funding to animal welfare charities for this year is underway.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s animal welfare funding is in addition to the &euro;100,000 that Bord na gCon makes directly to the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust. This funding is matched by a 2% contribution of winning owner&rsquo;s prizemoney, which in itself derives from the Horse &amp;amp; Greyhound Fund.  In 2018, the total income of the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust was &euro;242,000.  Bord na gCon&rsquo;s overall spend on regulation and welfare matters will be just short of &euro;2 million in 2019.</p><p>With regards to the export of greyhounds, under Council Directive 92/65/EEC (the &ldquo;Balai&rdquo; Directive), dogs moved commercially to another EU country from Ireland must be accompanied by an EU pet passport, be microchipped and have a valid rabies vaccination.  Also, under the Balai Directive, premises exporting dogs must be registered with the Department in advance of the export.  Before travel, dogs must undergo a clinical examination by an authorised veterinarian, who must verify that the dogs show no obvious signs of disease and are fit to be transported.  Dogs must also have a health certificate issued by a Department veterinarian.  These procedures, including vaccination, ensure that only healthy dogs, over the age of 15 weeks, are allowed to be exported. </p><p>Exporters are also required to comply with the provisions of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1 of 2005 on the protection of animals during transport. </p><p>My Department only issues health certs for export once all the criteria outlined above have been met. For this reason, in general health certificates are not revoked, as they would not have been issued if all requirements were not fulfilled. </p><p>It is not possible to establish exact figures for greyhound exports to other EU countries, as TRACES, the European Commission&rsquo;s online management tool for all sanitary requirements on intra-EU trade and importation of animals, does not distinguish between breeds of dogs moved commercially.  The figures for commercial movements of dogs from Ireland to other European Member States for the years 2014 to date are in the table below.  <table><tr><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019: YTD</th></tr><tr><td>3,316</td><td>10,847</td><td>12,103</td><td>12,898</td><td>10,322</td><td>5,193</td></tr></table></p><p>Information received from my Department&rsquo;s Regional Veterinary Offices indicate the following commercial movements of greyhound to third countries from 2016-2019. <table><tr><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019: YTD</th></tr><tr><td>China - 9</td><td>Chile - 1</td><td>Argentina - 1</td><td>Australia - 1</td></tr><tr><td>Argentina - 11</td><td>South Africa - 2</td><td></td><td>South Africa - 1</td></tr></table></p></reply>

All 31 premises, including the specific Eircode referenced by the Deputy, are in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at . The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. The premises in the townland will receive access to a high speed broadband service through this intervention. </p><p>This intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p><p>The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p><p>In the first year of this roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. A deployment plan will be made available by the bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed. </p><p>The Deputy makes reference to the proximity of the premises in Ballycroy to a commercial deployment of high speed broadband. This deployment is part of eir's commercial roll out of high speed broadband to 300,000 predominantly rural premises, in line with a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of the Commitment Agreement, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. </p><p>Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis. I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.</p></reply>

The RESS is being designed within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework and the scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of 70% by 2030. </p>  <p>  Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix. Globally, the costs of renewable technologies are falling rapidly with solar PV showing the most rapid decrease in prices in recent years. </p>  <p>  I am targeting the delivery of indicative volumes of up to 1.5 GW of grid scale solar by 2030. Grid scale solar energy farms will be critical to diversifying the renewable technology mix and to deliver gains through connecting hybrid renewable technologies. </p>  <p>The terms and conditions of the RESS auctions will set out the process by which all competing technologies including grid scale solar farms connect and receive support for supplying energy to the national grid. The first RESS auction is expected to open for applications in late 2019. In addition corporate power purchase agreements will provide a route to market for solar PV and will be key to meeting our 70% RES-E target.   </p></reply>

In relation to pollution from traffic sources, the pollutant of greatest concern is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).A report from the Environmental Protection Agency, released this week, indicates areas around certain heavily trafficked roads in the Dublin area, including the M50, may have higher levels of NO2 than previously indicated. The report indicates that away from busy roads, levels of NO2 drop significantly and are well beneath the recommended EU limits in many residential areas. Around the M50, the highest concentrations are within 10 metres of the motorway edge, with levels falling to background levels at a distance of 50 to 75 metres. </p><p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an air pollutant associated with urban areas, strongly linked with traffic emissions and which is known to have detrimental impacts on human health. Diesel vehicles have historically far higher nitrogen dioxide emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles. </p><p>This report underlines the need to implement the Climate Action Plan. The Plan includes a number of actions which will have a significant impact on reducing emissions and improving air quality, including targets for electric vehicle numbers. This work will complement the work already underway in developing a Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities. The Clean Air Strategy will address priority air pollutants in Ireland, including vehicle emissions, in an integrated manner. I intend to publish the Strategy in the coming months.</p><p>The European Communities (Environmental Noise) Regulations 2018 provide a common framework to avoid, prevent or reduce, the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise, including noise emitted by means of road, rail and air traffic. </p><p>The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria, such as large agglomerations, major roads, railways and airports. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned. The Regulations provide for strategic noise maps and action plans to be made available to the general public.The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.</p><p>Primary responsibility for both noise mapping and action planning is assigned to Local Authorities. The Regulations designate the Environmental Protection Agency as the National Authority for the purposes of the Regulations. The Agency's role includes supervisory, advisory and coordination functions in relation to both noise mapping and action planning, as well as reporting requirements for the purpose of the Directive.</p><p>Further information on strategic noise maps and action plans is available at the following links:</p><p><b>South Dublin County Council</b></p><p><b>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council</b></p><p><b>EPA</b></p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.  The school referenced by the Deputy is in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at .</p><p>The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p><p>The State led intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p><p>The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment</p><p>In the first year of this roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>A deployment plan will be made available by the bidder once the contract is signed. The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by end of the second year of the overall deployment, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed. </p><p>The Deputy makes reference to houses in the area that have been connected. I note that these premises are likely part of eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband. This deployment is part of eir's commercial roll out of high speed broadband to 300,000 predominantly rural premises, in line with a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>eir&rsquo;s rural investment in high speed broadband is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network.

I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services.</p></reply>

As the designated competent authority, decisions regarding applications for end-of-waste status are the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).    In June 2018, my Department established a Construction Waste Resource Group comprising key Construction and Demolition sector and Waste sector stakeholders, including policy, regulatory and industry representatives to provide a valuable platform to discuss and monitor construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste issues arising, including the capacity of the sector to manage C&amp;D waste.</p>  <p>  The issue of end-of-waste status for certain materials, including crushed concrete, has been discussed at each of the three meetings of this Resource Group, including the most recent meeting which took place on 19 June 2019. My officials, in conjunction with representatives of the EPA, have reminded those present that end-of-waste decisions can only be made once industry has submitted comprehensive applications to the EPA and satisfied the EPA that a decision to grant end-of waste status is appropriate. End of waste decisions have been made when the application and supporting materials allows for positive decisions to be made. If the industry wish to co-ordinate a national application for end of waste status for crushed concrete they are welcome to do so.</p></reply>

Irish policy in this area is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP.These guidelines provide scientifically-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ComReg, the independent telecoms regulatory authority, ensures that licensed mobile operators comply with their licence conditions and do not exceed ICNIRP guidelines. </p><p>In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM). This was published in 2016 and is entitled <i>&ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;</i>. It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication. This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, <i>&ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;</i>, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p><p>This is an area that is kept under review, and in this regard, I have recently assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area.  </p></reply>

The application requests consent to prospect in a number of townlands in County Galway. This application was published in the Connacht Tribune on 6 June 2019 and has been open for consultation since then. </p>  <p>  A Prospecting Licence was held for this area between 2006 and 2018.</p>  <p>  A Prospecting Licence (PL) relates to prospecting only and does not confer any permission to mine. </p>  <p>  In the event that an economically viable mineral deposit is discovered, a completely new process is required in advance of permission being granted to mine. A State Mining Facility is only granted once Planning Permission has been obtained from the Local Authority (incorporating full environmental impact assessment) and an Integrated Pollution Control Licence (IPC) has been received from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). </p>  <p>  All prospecting activities proposed to be undertaken under a Prospecting Licence are subject to environmental screening by my Department (including screening for Appropriate Assessment and, in the case of drilling, Environmental Impact Assessment). Connemara National Park is more than 10 kilometres from the proposed licence area, and there is long standing policy in place that prohibits prospecting in a National Park. </p>  <p>  There has been no specific consultation with the Minister for Culture Heritage and the Gaeltacht or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to this application. However, should any future licensee propose to undertake prospecting activities within a designated Natura 2000 site, the normal protocol is for the Department to seek observations from the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </p>  <p>  My Department is not in receipt of an application to mine in Connemara, Co Galway.</p></reply>

They must also be designed to be as accessible as possible for those with mobility issues and users of Wheelchairs and Mobility vehicles.  It is also important to remember that many users of Greenways are pedestrians and thus design must also accommodate buggy and pram users. </p>  <p>  The decision on the modes of transport permitted to use a particular Greenway, or sections thereof, is ultimately a decision made by the Local Authority or State Agency in charge of that Greenway. However, as is stated in my Department's Strategy for the Future Development of National and Regional Greenways, there may be some short sections of Greenways where some motorized vehicles, such as cars and tractors, may use the Greenway. Generally this tends to be on discrete sections where houses have been built or where access to farmland is required and would entail a very low number of vehicular journeys per day, these movements would also tend to be at a low speed. </p></reply>

This includes the effect on sectors supporting the cruise tourism industry or serving cruise visitors, not just in Dublin but in other ports and associated regions around Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have since held further, positive meetings with key stakeholders, including Dublin Port Company, and representatives of other ports, the tourism agencies and other industry stakeholders.  These meetings have assisted the relevant bodies to consider the options available that could help mitigate any potential negative impacts on the cruise industry and Irish tourism during the period of construction work.</p>  <p>  Through my wider stakeholder engagements, I have encouraged port and cruise industry stakeholders to take maximum advantage of other options available during the period of construction at Dublin port.  While Dublin Port is important in attracting cruise liners to Ireland through Dublin, other benefits can accrue to other ports around our coast.   To this end the Port of Cork, Dun Laoghaire Harbour and Belfast Harbour are considering how they can take some of the additional business that may be lost as a result of Dublin Port's infrastructural works.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the development and promotion of the cruise tourism sector and assists with the visitor welcome at Dublin Port.  I understand that they have completed survey research amongst cruise tourism passengers.  This analysis has been shared with the economic advisers working on behalf of Dublin Port Company for input into their deliberations in respect of future investment in cruise shipping capacity at the Port.  Tourism Ireland is supporting the Port of Cork and the Port of Belfast, to assist them with their programmes overseas, and is actively engaging with Cruise Ireland regarding marketing initiatives that could be pursued jointly overseas.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to monitor developments on this matter, together with both tourism agencies.  Given these ongoing efforts to disperse business across other ports, it remains to be seen what the ultimate impact the construction work at Dublin Port will have on overall cruise business.  </p></reply>

As of the 22 June, not a single test centre in the country has an average waiting time of greater than 10 weeks, with the national average waiting time currently standing at 6.9 weeks.  This marked improvement has come about as a result of the recruitment by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) of a large amount of additional driver testers since the beginning of this year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's follow-on suggestion that a long-term learner permit holder with an accident-free record be automatically entitled to a full licence runs entirely contrary to the principles underpinning our testing and licencing system. A learner who has held multiple consecutive permits will, in most cases, have had sufficient time to develop their driving skills and reach the point where they are ready to take the test. The purpose of the test is to allow learners to demonstrate their ability to drive safely and responsibly under varied and challenging conditions.  To award a licence to an individual who has not met this basic passing standard would be a dangerous and retrograde step and not one my Department is prepared to entertain.</p></reply>

Such flexibility would be unusual, however, as airlines generally operate scheduled services.   </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report re-iterated many of the findings of the Ricardo Study and also called for the establishment of an ad hoc group of Member State experts dealing with aviation and labour law matters to identify best practices, ensuring a level playing field and quality working conditions. The first meeting of this expert group took place in Brussels in early April 2019 with aviation officials from my Department attending. The next meeting is scheduled for the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.   </p>  <p>  Issues that have been raised in relation to atypical employment and the standard of employment conditions in aviation are equally valid for other employment sectors far larger than aviation, such as construction, IT, hospitality, healthcare, etc. In order to maintain the coherence of the wider EU social dimension, such matters should be addressed through wider employment legislation at EU and Member State level, rather than at sector (aviation) level.    </p>  <p>  One of the numerous regulated areas of aviation safety is that relating to flying hours for aircrew. Compliance with these rules is overseen by the Irish Aviation Authority, in respect of airlines licensed in Ireland.</p></reply>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have made clear my intent, and that of the Government, to transition from diesel fuelled buses towards greener fuels and technologies, for the great potential such technologies offer to reduce carbon and other harmful air pollutant emissions, and importantly, placing the public transport system in a strong leadership role. </p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory towards low-emission has firmly been established. In the short term, we are committed under Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this month onwards. Consequently, the NTA recently initiated a tender competition to award a &ldquo;Framework Agreement for the Supply of Double-Deck Diesel-Electric Hybrid Buses&rdquo;. To help inform a longer-term bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the NTA, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks. Findings from this trial, alongside EU public fleet procurement requirements under the Clean Vehicles Directive together with on-going market analysis and research will collectively inform the NTA's approach to its bus purchase programme in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the BusConnects programme will be rolled out across all our major cities, starting in Dublin. This programme is expected to have a transformative effect on the operation of bus services and will improve bus journey times by 40% to 50%; provide a bus service that is easier to use and understand; enable more people to travel by bus than ever before; and provide a network of cycling infrastructure that will enable more people to cycle. Low emitting buses will be employed under the BusConnects programme with the intention that 50% of the public urban bus fleet in the Greater Dublin Area will transition to a low emitting option by 2023 and 100% by 2030. Buses will be replaced when they reach the end of their optimal life. For the double deck bus fleet this is approximately 12 years.  It is important to note that additional vehicles may also be required to increase capacity on the network to cater for increasing travel demand or any new services.</p>  <p>  Noting its responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your question to the NTA for consideration and direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Regulation 598 sets out the rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise related operating restrictions at European Union Airports.  </p>  <p>  The Act provides, for the first time, that noise generated by aircraft activity at Dublin Airport will be subject to extensive detailed assessment, on-going monitoring and to regular review.  It also respects existing planning and development and environmental laws and is underpinned by binding EU Regulations and Directives on environmental and aircraft noise. It further ensures that every time a planning application at Dublin Airport is considered the aircraft noise implications are considered also.</p>  <p>  Fingal County Council has been designated as the independent noise regulator for Dublin Airport with An Bord Plean&aacute;la designated as the independent appeals body. </p>  <p>  Fingal County Council is establishing a new, dedicated aircraft Noise Regulation Office within the executive branch, which will include the appropriate noise expertise.  The Office will be headed at a senior level by a Director of Services, with all of the appropriate arrangements to ensure decisions are taken fully in accordance with the law.  </p>  <p>  All of the provisions of the Act have been subject to legal scrutiny by the Office of the Attorney General and have been examined in great detail by the Oireachtas.  I am fully satisfied that Fingal County Council meets the requirements set out in Regulation 598/2014 for a noise regulator.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Overseas visitor numbers continued to grow and contributed over &euro;5 billion to the economy.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland monitors the performance of tourist accommodation through regular occupancy surveys.  This analysis indicates that while the country as a whole has sufficient stock of tourist accommodation, there are capacity constraints in areas of high tourist traffic at times of peak demand and additional capacity is required in certain parts of the country, particularly Dublin city. </p>  <p>  In this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland commissions periodic assessments of hotel accommodation in Dublin, most recently August 2018.  Although the latest results confirm the current shortage, they expect that approximately 5,400 hotel rooms will come on stream in the coming years, including over 3,000 already under construction.  Present projections are that this activity will still be outpaced by growing demand but this is a dynamic situation and additional room stock may be developed in response to this demand. </p>  <p>  Last year F&aacute;ilte also commissioned a new study of accommodation capacity in three key non-Dublin destiations - Cork, Galway and Kilkenny.   The report highlights the need to develop new accommodation stock and opportunties for investment in Kilkenny, where 41 new rooms are likely to come on stream by 2022 to add to the current supply, an increase of just 4%.  Galway will have an estimated 17% increase in hotel bed stock over the next five years, 500 new hotel rooms, but this increase is likely to fall short of expected demand growth.  In regard to Cork, current figures project a 35% increase (over 920 new hotel rooms) by 2022, which positions the city well to take full advantage of all future growth potential.  As in Dublin, these are dynamic markets and the supply of room stock may change in response to demand.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-09a.1762.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019070900086#WRX04900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 680 and 683 together.</p>  <p>Brexit has been identified as my Department&rsquo;s highest strategic risk and the Department, along with other Government Departments and key Agencies, has been preparing for Brexit for three years. This preparation is continuing through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. While planning continues for both a no-deal Brexit and the &lsquo;central case&rsquo; scenario, the Government is focussing its preparations on a no-deal Brexit on 31st October 2019.</p>  <p>  While the full implications of Brexit for our air and maritime transport are not yet clear, I do not anticipate that direct maritime or direct air services by community air carriers between Ireland and continental Europe will be affected, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  </p>  <p>  That said, a significant proportion of our goods destined for EU markets are transported via the UK landbridge to access these markets. Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe. </p>  <p>  In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. Following a series of meetings between my officials and the major ferry companies operating at Irish ports, I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports. These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, which is operating between Dublin and Cherbourg since March 2019. Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.</p>  <p>  If disruption to the landbridge does arise, it is likely to be most acute in the immediate period following the UK exit. My Department, along with IMDO, will be implementing a number of mitigating actions to encourage a market response in a timely manner. These will include a focussed awareness campaign from early September aimed at shipping companies, importers and exporters to create a dialogue between them to identify new market demands as early as possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity. Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme. There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports.</p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding adequate travel provisions in the air travel sector, under EU law, air operators must fulfil certain ownership and control (O&amp;C) criteria in order to be classified as an EU air carrier.  The European Commission has been clear from the outset that it is essential for air operators for whom Brexit may lead to a failure to comply with these requirements to take appropriate counter measures. The EU Contingency Regulation on Air Connectivity set down a timeframe for restructuring plans to be submitted to national regulators. All affected air operators licensed in Ireland have submitted their respective restructuring plans to the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR), within the 11th April deadline under the EU basic connectivity regulation. CAR has issued its determinations on these plans and is in ongoing contact with these airlines in relation to their restructuring plans and these determinations have been notified to the European Commission. It is understood that the Commission will review all such proposals. </p>  <p>  In addition, Regulation (EU) 2019/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity aims to ensure the continuation of a basic level of air connectivity for citizens and business between the UK and Europe in the event of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement. While certain provisions within this Regulation have entered into force, the majority will only apply if and when the UK exits the EU without a deal.  </p></reply>

The Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption.</p>  <p>  The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, plays a key role in the national decarbonisation effort. It is worth noting that transport emissions are classified under both the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS systems. Generally, non-domestic emissions such as those from international aviation within Europe are accounted for under the ETS system while domestic transport emissions fall under the non-ETS system. The Climate Action Plan deals primarily with the non-ETS sector, where Ireland has a legal binding emissions reduction target of 20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030 (relative to 2005 levels).  Accordingly, the focus of the transport elements of the Plan relate mainly to reducing land transport emissions and not those generated by international travel and in-coming tourists. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions for inclusion in the Climate Action Plan, particularly in relation to public transport and active travel.  A critical challenge is reducing the 52% of transport emissions that come from private car use.  Our aim in expanding the carrying capacity and the attractiveness of our public transport and active travel networks is to provide a viable sustainable alternative to private car use for more people for more of their journeys. Under Project Ireland 2040, an indicative allocation of &euro;8.6 billion is assigned to support sustainable mobility ensuring that public transport and active travel become more available and attractive alternatives. </p>  <p>  A switch to electric vehicles (EVs) is a key mitigation measure of the Plan, with a target of almost 950,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2030. While this level of transition is incredibly challenging, as technologies improve and become cheaper, and if we continue incentives and invest in the recharging network we are ambitious that with a real push we can make real progress towards this target by 2030. Concerted efforts across several Departments will be essential if we are to maintain a supportive environment to assist citizens in making the greener choice and switching to an EV. My Department and I will work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the roadmap that will be necessary to achieve our collective ambition.</p>  <p>  In terms of tourism, while there are no specific actions in the Plan, climate change can have direct and indirect impacts on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry. Urban tourism may be less affected than coastal tourism where sea level rise, increasing ocean acidification and coastal erosion can threaten Ireland&rsquo;s coastal tourism infrastructure and natural attractions. It is difficult to predict possible changes to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination as a result of climate change and the impact of this on the economic value of tourism in Ireland and tourism demand. Destination attractions such as Skellig Michael and the Burren could be especially vulnerable; therefore the role of the tourism sector in adaptation planning is extremely important. </p>  <p>  The range of implications of climate change on the transport, tourism, and even sport sectors means that I and my Department are fully committed to achieving the climate change objectives set out in the Climate Action Plan. I am personally committed to the decarbonisation of the transport sector and I hope to see transport emissions levels continue to fall as they did in 2018. Indeed, every sector must step-up if Ireland is to meet our emission reduction targets in 2030 and beyond.</p></reply>

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. Ensuring that this money is properly accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is a core responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Pobal assists the Department in the administration of the funding and in ensuring that services are compliant with the clearly documented rules of the schemes.</p>  <p>   The Public Accounts Committee on June 13 paid significant attention to this matter and highlighted the importance of compliance with scheme rules. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs' approach to compliance, and supporting services, strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. The approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended through a strong compliance framework.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by the Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, which are available on the DCYA website. As stated above, compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of the Department. </p>  <p>  Part of Pobal&rsquo;s role in overseeing compliance is to carry out unannounced visits to services to check their compliance with programme rules. Subsidies for the Early Learning and Care and School Age childcare programmes are paid based on child attendance, which is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. Where Pobal discover that the actual attendance of a child does not match registrations for that child on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (Pobal's IT system) they will calculate the amount of funding that has been overclaimed. The service will be advised by Pobal to make the necessary corrections to PIP registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. There is an appropriate amount of flexibility applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case by case basis. However, the recovery of overclaimed funds is an integral part of ensuring that public money is properly accounted for.</p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the period October 2018 &ndash; March 2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which required immediate attention. Under CCSP, if a child increases or decreases their attendance, the service provider must update PIP registrations to reflect the actual attendance of that child. Following a compliance visit, funding is only corrected to account for the time a particular child actually attends a service.  My Department does not collect information on the number of children for whom incorrect registrations are identified through compliance visits. However, in the period October 2018 - March 2019, 233 services operating CCSP contracts were found to need to update PIP registrations to match the actual attendance of children. Over this six-month period, Pobal estimated that approximately &euro;1.4 million in potential overclaims were identified and prevented on the CCSP programme, with approximately &euro;4.7 million potential overclaims identified and prevented across all programmes. These figures come with caveats owing to the type of data involved.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the compliance activity should not result in any child having any service withdrawn, rather that the service provider only claims from the Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to the Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase.  </p>  <p>  Significant support is available to services facing sustainability issues to bring their service onto a sustainable footing, whilst being necessarily compliant with scheme rules. My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment. I would recommend all services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  The existing targeted childcare schemes will be replaced later this year with the National Childcare Scheme. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, which I published last November.</p></reply>

This publication, which estimates that Ireland spends 0.1% of GDP on pre-primary education, is based on public investment levels from 2015. I understand the OECD Education at a Glance Report 2019 is currently being drafted.</p>  <p>  The OECD adopt a number of approaches to calculate Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on early learning and care. One approach includes an estimate of the cost of primary school for children under 6 as well as other early learning and care costs: this is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in some other countries. Using this approach, the OECD estimates that Ireland spent 0.5% of GDP on early learning and care in 2016. The OECD indicates that every .1% of GDP increase above this will cost &euro;300 million. If the cost of primary school for children under six is excluded, Ireland spent just 0.2% of GDP on early learning and care. This level of investment in 2016 investment compares poorly to other European countries where the OECD average investment on children under six is 0.8%. It also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1% of GDP. </p>  <p>  Historically, there has been low levels of investment in early learning and care in Ireland. Since 2015 however, we have started to address this. Over the past four budgets, investment in early learning and care and school age childcare has increased by some 117% - rising from in &euro;260 million 2015 to &euro;574 million in 2019. Notwithstanding this very significant progress, investment remains relatively low to other developed countries.</p>  <p>   The OECD in its report - Faces of Joblessness - compared the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare supports previously available in Ireland with the expected impact of the National Childcare Scheme. For a lone parent working full time at the 25th percentile of the full-time earnings distribution, Early Learning and Care costs in Ireland were the highest among all OECD countries in 2015. The Faces of Joblessness report estimated that NCS will bring net ELC costs down to make Ireland only the 11th highest in the OECD, or closer to the OECD average. This analysis was performed before Budget 2019 which increased the NCS thresholds at both ends and which would have enhanced the results further if included. </p>  <p>  First 5: A Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families published in November 2018 sets out an ambitious programme of work across Government Departments to improve the experiences and outcomes of children in Ireland from birth to age 5 across all aspects of their lives in the coming ten years.  One of the major objectives is that babies and young children have access to safe, high-quality, developmentally appropriate Early Learning and Care which reflects diversity of need.  Allied to that objective, First 5 identifies as a key building block additional public funding, strategically invested to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families.  Under this objective, First 5 commits to at least doubling investment in Early Learning and Care by 2028.</p></reply>

The levying of commercial rates is the responsibility of the Valuations Office, which falls under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Act, 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Under Schedule 4, paragraph 22, community childcare facilities are exempt from commercial rates, by virtue of the fact that they operate on a not-for-profit basis. The Valuations Office have also advised that, under Schedule 4 paragraph 10, facilities who provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE) only are exempt from commercial rates.  All other childcare providers are, therefore, rateable. </p>  <p>  My Department has made considerable investment in the provision of affordable and accessible quality childcare, and I am conscious that the issue of commercial rates may be a barrier to achieving these goals.  </p>  <p>  I am also conscious of this issue in the context of the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the new, national scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare, in October 2019.  If an ECCE-only service wishes to offer NCS it will become liable for commercial rates.  This disincentivisation to provide wraparound services has the potential to create capacity issues within the sector, at a time when my Department is seeking to increase capacity.  </p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rates is one that has been raised by the early learning and care sector, in particular through the National Early Years Forum, which I established in 2016.  My Department has therefore taken a number of steps to pursue this matter, including meeting with relevant officials to explore the possibility of obtaining an exemption of the application of commercial rates to private childcare providers, on the basis that they are educational facilities.</p>  <p>  Most recently I contacted the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, requesting reconsideration of the position of private childcare facilities in respect of their rateability for commercial rates.  It was confirmed that there are no proposals under consideration for a discount of commercial rates for private childcare providers, and that the Commissioner of Valuation has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4 of the Act.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have made every effort to raise the concerns of the early learning and care sector in this respect, however as the matter falls outside the remit of my Department, I am constrained in the role I can play.  My Department will, however, continue to monitor this matter and raise it where appropriate.</p></reply>

Using the best available evidence, it modelled likely impacts and found that a decrease in childcare costs in Ireland, through a mechanism such as the National Childcare Scheme, would see a resulting rise in female labour market participation. </p><p>In late 2017, a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) was published alongside the Childcare Support Bill 2017.  At the outset, the RIA referenced the European Commission statement that &quot;The availability and cost of quality fulltime childcare present barriers to female labour market participation and hinder efforts to reduce child poverty&quot;.  It then analysed the costs, benefits and impacts of the National Childcare Scheme, finding it to result in wider eligibility for childcare subsidies and positive labour market incentives.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support for quality childcare, thereby supporting labour market participation, female labour market participation and poverty reduction. </p><p>At a broader level, the implementation of the Scheme is also referenced as an action in the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017- 2020.  </p><p>Finally, in addition to gender-proofing the Scheme, I have also worked to poverty-proof the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme.  Analysis by the OECD finds that the Scheme will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11th position.</p></reply>

In July 2018 I brought the high-level scheme outline to Government for Information; this outline was arrived at following detailed consultation with the sector and young people, relevant evidence review and a sampling process. The outline stated that young people aged 10 to 24 years of age who are described in the National Youth Strategy (NYS) as marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable will be the primary target group for services available through the TYFS.</p>  <p>  This outline has since provided the basis for further development of the scheme, the final drafting process of which is currently underway. In addition to development of the new scheme, significant other changes have been introduced including; in January of this year, four funding streams were successfully collapsed in to one scheme in advance of the introduction of the new scheme in 2020. In April 2019, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed between my Department and each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and the process of transferring funds to their functional ETB area began on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Throughout this reform my Department has been engaging proactively with the stakeholders and sample services in relation to various component of the new scheme. In 2018, 6 ETBs participated in a trial and co-design of the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement Tool (APNARS). The tool is designed to enable Education and Training Boards (ETB), who have a mid-level governance role in the new youth funding scheme, to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their ETB functional area to enable better targeting of services for young people. Based on the information gathered, the ETB analyse the needs of young people in the area and consider the extent to which these needs are being met within existing youth service provision. Completing the tool provides ETBs with a systematic and evidence-informed assessment of needs to inform judgements about priorities for service provision. It also ensures that youth services/projects funded under the new scheme are focused on working to meet the identified needs and key issues in the area in line with the stated objectives of the new scheme. The tool also provides a standardised national template for producing an area profile, needs assessment and Service Requirement document across all ETBs. The tool is a critical component in an evidence-informed approach to providing well targeted services to young people. Service Requirement documents will issue from ETBs to services/projects who are applying for funding through the grant application process on the targeted groups and key issues that are priority. </p></reply>

This reform is informed by the Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) of the Youth Funding Programmes 2014.  The VFMPR of the Youth Funding Programmes 2014 examined three of the targeted funding schemes, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, the Special Projects for Youth (SPY) scheme and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme.  Overall, the review found that the youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding. The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead to ensure an evidence-based and outcomes focussed programme designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people. The review recommended the development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes.</p><p>To facilitate the review&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the future development of a single targeted youth funding programme to replace the current schemes, I approved funding allocations for the establishment of several sample projects in 2016 and 2017. </p><p>There are now 23 such sample projects approved since 2016, of which 21 were operational in 2018 and a further two are to commence in 2019. Of the 23 projects, seven have involved the augmentation of existing projects to respond to identified needs.</p><p>I am circulating a set of tables with details of the 23 sample projects, by year of first approval.</p><p>In determining the sample projects for funding, my Department has worked closely with the 16 Education and Training Boards, all of which were invited to nominate locations within their catchment areas for new and augmented projects.</p><p>The 23 sample projects fall within ten of the ETB areas. The remaining six ETBs are currently involved in a process to identify the local needs of young people in these areas, with a view to submitting applications for new or augmented services in 2019.</p><p>In advance of the introduction of a new single targeted funding scheme in 2020, a transition phase in 2019 will see the funding previously provided under four funding programmes, (Special Projects for Youth, Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund 1&amp;amp;2, Local Drugs Task Force Projects and Youth Information Centres) collapsed into one funding stream for 2019 to assist with preparations for the new scheme in 2020. </p><p>I believe that the reformed system will bring substantial benefits to our young people, and my Department will continue with this important work.</p><p><b>New Sample Projects approved 2016</b><table><tr><th>Location </th><th>ETB </th></tr><tr><td>Boomerang Youth Service Drogheda, Co Louth</td><td>Louth Meath ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Crosscare Youth Service West Wicklow</td><td>Kildare Wicklow ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Cahir Youth Project, CoTipperary</td><td>Tipperary ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Fethard/ Killenaule Youth Project, Co Tipperary</td><td>Tipperary ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Bounce Back Youth Project, East Cavan, Co Cavan</td><td>Cavan Monaghan ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon VFM Project, Co Roscommon</td><td>Galway Roscommon ETB</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Augmented Projects approved 2017</b><table><tr><th>Location </th><th>ETB </th></tr><tr><td>Include Youth Service Co Monaghan</td><td>Cavan Monaghan ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Cloyne Diocesian Youth <br /><br />Service Project Middleton</td><td>Cork ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Crosscare &ndash; East Wicklow Youth Service</td><td>Kildare Wicklow ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Ossory Youth Kilkenny<br /><br />Gateway Project (YWI)</td><td>Kilkenny Carlow ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Croom For&oacute;ige Youth Project, Croom Co Limerick</td><td>Limerick Clare ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Co Longford Youth Service (CLYS)</td><td>Longford Westmeath ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Templemore Youth Project &amp;amp; Thurles Youth Project, Co Tipperary</td><td>Tipperary ETB</td></tr></table></p><p><b>New Sample Projects approved 2017</b><table><tr><th>Location </th><th>ETB </th></tr><tr><td>Bounce Back Youth Project West Cavan</td><td>Cavan Monaghan ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Carrigaline Youth Project, Co Cork</td><td>Cork ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Mitchelstown Youth Project, Mitchelstown, Co Cork</td><td>Cork ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Rural North (Skerries)</td><td>Dublin Dun Laoghaire ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Tyrrelstown Youth Project Dublin 15</td><td>Dublin Dun Laoghaire ETB</td></tr><tr><td>County Longford Project</td><td>Longford Westmeath ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Foroige Gort Youth Project, Gort, Co Galway</td><td>Galway Roscommon ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Tullow Community Youth Project, Tullow Co Carlow</td><td>Kilkenny Carlow ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Garryowen Youth Project, Garryowen, Co Limerick</td><td>Limerick Clare ETB</td></tr><tr><td>Foroige Ballyhaunis Youth Project, Ballyhaunis, Co Mayo</td><td>Mayo Sligo Leitrim ETB</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Having considered the existing and emerging needs in  this area, I directed my officials to take a strategic approach to the subject  of school engagement and retention.

In  Budget 2019 I secured an additional &euro;500,000 in funding for the EWS and the  Alternative Education Assessment and Registration Service. And I will continue  to lead on advancing supports both in policy and provision in this crucial  area.</p></reply>

In the longer term, it includes improved outcomes for children and parents, and value for money in service provision, achieved through shifting Tusla&rsquo;s family support budget in favour of evidence-informed prevention and early intervention services. </p>  <p>  It aims to achieve these outcomes through five main operational work streams. These work streams are Meitheal and Child and Family Support Networks, Children&rsquo;s Participation, Parenting Support and Parental Participation, Public Awareness, and Commissioning. </p>  <p>  In practice the Meitheal model focuses on identifying, understanding, and responding to the needs and strengths of children, young people and families in a timely manner to provide help and support to improve outcomes. It is intended to be used when children and young people need support around, for example, behavioural issues or emotional needs, but do not meet the threshold for an intervention by Tusla&rsquo;s Child Protection and Welfare service. </p>  <p>  The family&rsquo;s voluntary involvement in identifying their strengths and needs and developing associated action plans is a key part of the process. In some cases, a single organisation can provide support but in general a team of people from a number of agencies with relevant expertise is brought together to work with the parents or guardians, the child or young person. A co-ordinated action plan is developed to meet the needs of the child or young person and if necessary other family members. Regular meetings are held to review the progress made and to discuss possible new actions.</p>  <p>  PPFS was subject to an evaluation study by the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at NUI Galway, published in September 2018. The evaluation found that the Meitheal practice model was improving family outcomes, particularly among mothers, and that it was valued by participating families. </p>  <p>  For 2019, a budget of &euro;9.5 million has been allocated to the PPFS and Area-Based Childhood (ABC) Programmes. This figure includes &euro;8.2 million which has been ring-fenced for the ABC Programme funding community based prevention services. &euro;1.3 million has been allocated to support the PPFS, and the ABC Programme has transitioned to the PPFS. To consolidate this important work the PPFS is a central subgroup of each Children and Young People's Services Committees (CYPSC) which are in place in every county.  My Department has led this strategic development and integration to ensure that a robust prevention and early intervention infrastructure comprising all relevant services is in place in local communities. </p></reply>

The payment also recognises the time required to perform activities outside of contact time with children, such as preparing materials for early learning and care sessions and assisting parents in understanding how they might benefit from the various early learning and care and school age childcare schemes supported by the State.</p>  <p>  The PSP was first introduced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2017 with an initial budget of &euro;14.5m and has been increased since then to amount to &euro;19.4m in 2019. Prior to that it was intended that capitation payments for ECCE or subsidies under the targeted programmes, together with parental co-payments, would cover all costs associated with the schemes including administrative overheads. While the budget for PSP has increased since introduction, the PSP remains a budget limited programme that cannot be demand lead and must therefore be reconsidered on an annual basis as circumstances change; for example significantly increased child registrations. The distribution of the 2019 PSP has been designed to be fair, effective and in keeping with the general policy set in previous years, in so far as possible. </p>  <p>  The 2019 PSP is calculated as equal to 7 days&rsquo; (1.4 weeks&rsquo;) registrations for ECCE at standard capitation, and 14 days&rsquo; (2.8 weeks&rsquo;) registrations for CCS(P) and TEC. The June 2019 payment is made in respect of the programme year 2018/2019. As in previous years, the payment is based on child registrations at a snapshot point in the year.  </p>  <p>  As we countdown towards the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme, it is important that providers continue to be supported. There will be an additional &euro;2m (over and above the &euro;19.4m described above) associated with the National Childcare Scheme which will be made available to service providers later in 2019 as &ldquo;Transitional Support Payment&rdquo;. This one-off payment is being provided to support providers to meet the administrative requirements associated with transitioning to a new Scheme. The size of the maximum payment available to each service will be based on the number of services applying and the number of children in those service who were actively registered on one of the Department&rsquo;s childcare programmes on 13th May 2019. Finally, it should also be noted that the subsidies for the NCS have been calculated to reflect the full costs (contact with children and non-contact/ administrative ) of delivering early learning and care and school age childcare services.</p></reply>

It has always been the policy intention of the Bill to provide for the greatest possible release of birth information to adopted persons, consistent with the legal and constitutional framework.</p>  <p>  An initial debate took place in the Seanad on Wednesday, 12 June and on June 19 the House took the decision to 'pause' the legislation and instead allow for statements on adoption. My legal advice is that some protection of birth parents' constitutional right to privacy must be reflected in the legislation. There are two rights at play, the right to identity and the right to privacy, and the Bill must seek to harmonise these rights. In my recent amendments, I sought to provide for the release of identifying information with the minimum restrictions possible.</p>  <p>  I recognise that there are strong views on and opposition to the privacy provisions in the Bill, and to the revised scheme set out in my proposed amendments for Committee Stage. Accordingly I have formed the view that further consultation is required to seek to identify a more acceptable mechanism for the release of information. </p>  <p>  I have therefore embarked on further consultations with Members of the Oireachtas and with stakeholder groups, to seek to reach a consensus which will allow the legislation to progress. </p>  <p>  Pending the outcome of these engagements, I hope to be in a position to bring the Bill back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the autumn.</p></reply>

Since then the following has been expended on digital marketing :</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department hosted a series of regional &lsquo;Rural Opportunity' information sessions to raise awareness of the wide variety of funding supports available to rural communities from across Government Departments. Staff from my Department and a number of other Departments and agencies were also on hand at the events to provide further information to attendees on the range of supports available.  As part of the Rural Opportunity campaign, a video was produced by a company, procured through the tendering process, which featured recipients, and demonstrated the range of supports available, detailing how the funding received made a difference to:  </p>  <p>  - job creation/enterprise in rural communities, enabling people to work in rural Ireland; </p>  <p>  - improving the quality of life for those living and working in rural communities &ndash; reducing social isolation and improving social cohesion; </p>  <p>  - attracting more visitors and tourism to rural communities; </p>  <p>  - harnessing a vibrant cultural scene within rural communities; and - assisting a Gaeltacht community and promoting the Irish language.</p>  <p>  The cost of producing the campaign video was &euro;19,557.  In addition to the production cost, &euro;4,078 was spent on promoting the video on social media to users in Ireland (not internationally) who had displayed an online interest in Irish rural life. </p>  <p>  My Department also placed an online advertisement for the public consultation on our Department's Irish language Scheme which cost &euro;615. This is the Department's first Language Scheme, and runs from 2019-2022. This Scheme has been formulated with the intention of ensuring that all relevant obligations under the Official Languages Act relating to the Department of Rural and Community Development are being fully addressed on an incremental basis, through this and future schemes. It sets out the Department&rsquo;s commitments to customer service in Irish and advises of the availability of services through Irish.</p></reply>

The governing social welfare legislation provides that, once  WFP is awarded the rate remains the same for a 52 week period  while a person continues to satisfy the employment condition regardless of changes in circumstances or  income or expenditure.  There are only 2 exceptions to this rule as follows which permit a review of the WFP rate during the award period: </p>  <p>  An additional child. </p>  <p>  or</p>  <p>  In the case of a WFP recipient who is also receiving a One Parent Family Payment (OPF) where this payment is terminated on account of their youngest child reaching the relevant age threshold during the WFP award period.    </p>  <p>  In accordance with the governing legislation "a qualified child" for WFP is defined as a child who is under 18 years of age  or over 18 years and under 22 years who is attending full-time certified day education and who normally resides with the applicant. The governing legislation further provides that a child who attains the age of 22 years during an academic year is also regarded as a qualified child for WFP while in full-time education for the duration of that academic year.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was in receipt of WFP for 4 qualified children and their claim was renewed on 20 December 2018 for the period 03 January 2019 to 01 January 2020 at the appropriate rate for 3 qualified children.  However their eldest child  was no longer deemed to be a qualified child for WFP at the time of renewal as they had reached the age of 22 years on 05 September 2018 in advance of their relevant academic year which commenced on 17 September 2018. </p>  <p>  Following an unsuccessful appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) the Department's decision of 20 December 2018 was upheld and the person  concerned was notified of the appeal outcome on 17 June 2019.</p>  <p>  An Appeals Officer's decision is normally final and conclusive in the absence of any new facts or evidence.  However it may be subject to review by the Chief Appeals Officer where it is considered that the decision was incorrect because of an error relating to the law or facts.</p>  <p>  In order to request a review of the Appeals Officer's decision the person concerned should enclose new facts or evidence to the SWAO or if seeking a review by the Chief Appeals Officer they must specify clearly the grounds for their review request.</p>  <p>  However the legislation also provides that a customer retains the right to request a review of any WFP decision and that this right is not time limited. Accordingly the person concerned may forward their request for a review of the Department's decision of 20 December 2018 to Working Family Payment Renewals,  Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, St. Oliver Plunkett Road, Letterkenny, Co Donegal, stating clearly the grounds for their review request. It should be noted that the subject of their disallowed appeal cannot be reviewed by the Department.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Almost all Irish defined benefit pension schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease contributions, usually after a notice period.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017) was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  It is intended that these measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act by providing for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhancing employer responsibilities for their schemes.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill at Committee Stage including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.</p>  <p>  In developing these provisions, it is essential to take account of the current pension landscape in Ireland so that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p>  <p>  The provisions of this Bill will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 which, amongst other things, will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing for a 12-month notification period, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p>  <p>  The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  In order to achieve a resilient solution it has been necessary to consult in detail with other Government Departments and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of the provisions.  When outstanding matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is unique in the social protection system as it is a payment provided to people with a specific physical impairment.  As such, it contains different eligibility and means criteria to disability allowance.  Unlike disability allowance, recipients of blind pension may also qualify for a range of other primary schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, illness benefit, and one-parent family payment.  Persons in receipt of the blind pension may also have an entitlement to blind welfare allowance from the HSE which is disregarded for the blind pension means test.</p>  <p>  The capital means test for disability allowance is also unique in the social protection system, in that it disregards &euro;50,000 of capital completely, compared to &euro;20,000 for most other social assistance schemes including blind pension.  84% of blind pension recipients with means from capital have means of less than &euro;20,000 and this is therefore completely disregarded.

This represented a real improvement in the level of social insurance cover available to the self-employed even though the level of contribution was not increased.

The Social Welfare Bill 2019 will provide for the necessary legislation required to introduce this new scheme and is progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Once enacted, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit self-employed will be payable to individuals who lose their self-employment and as a consequence are no longer engaged in self-employment. To qualify for the scheme a person will have to satisfy the qualifying conditions including a PRSI contribution condition.</p>  <p>  As with any new demand led scheme it is difficult to forecast the numbers that will apply and qualify. Factors such as labour market conditions and the prevailing economic conditions will affect the take up of this scheme. The Department estimates that some 1,000 could benefit from the scheme in 2019 and approximately 6,500 could benefit at any point in time in a full year.  A breakdown of this information on a county basis is not currently available. </p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2018 ENPs were made in respect of 2,812 funerals at a cost of &euro;5.317m and 69 burial expenses at a cost of &euro;140,674.</p>  <p>  The number of bereavement grant claims in 2013 was 23,716, and this represented an increase of approximately 4% on 2012.  Based on a similar yearly increase each year since 2013, it is estimated that the number of bereavement grant claims that might arise in 2020, were the scheme to be reintroduced, would be in the region of 31,200, and the number would be expected to increase in future years.  Accordingly, if there were 31,200 such grants made in 2019, at a rate of &euro;850 each, the cost would be approx. &euro;26.5 million.  Any decision to reinstate it would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I believe the deliberate mis-classification of a worker as a self-employed contractor, in a situation where they are actually working as an employee, is wrong. It is wrong for three reasons. </p>  <p>  Firstly, it denies the worker full protection under the Social Welfare Act, which means he or she is deprived of entitlements such as short-term illness and disability benefits.</p>  <p>  Secondly, it deprives the worker of protection under labour law which means the a worker is left without any redress if they are unfairly dismissed, made redundant, or are not paid minimum wage rates, for example.</p>  <p>  Thirdly, this form of non-compliance by employers deprives all taxpayers in the form of reduced returns to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I have assigned my officials the task of modernising the Code of Practice on employment status. This is a vital tool for employers and employees so they can be clear when a worker is genuinely self-employed or alternatively when they should be recorded as an employee under full PRSI. A new manual &ndash; the Guidance on Employment Status &ndash; is almost finalised and I have said that I will be circulating it to ICTU and IBEC before it is published to get their input. </p>  <p>  The new Guidance will be put on a statutory footing, to ensure it becomes central to the decision-making process in employment status cases.</p>  <p>  I believe that enforcement of PRSI compliance is paramount and I want strong enforcement activity to complement the new Guidance provisions. My Department's inspectors have commenced a campaign of increasing the level of employer inspections nationwide. I have established a new Unit of inspectors, specifically trained and dedicated to the detection and tackling of false self-employment in particular.</p>  <p>  Anyone who has a query or concern about how their employment has been classified by an employer to contact Scope Section of my Department. Scope Section will commence an investigation, which can involve referral of the matter out to a Social Welfare Inspector, and ultimately decide on the appropriate employment status.</p>  <p>  A good deal of progress has been made by my officials in developing a number of legislative proposals that strengthen the protections for workers in situations of false self-employment. These include providing anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status. I also wish to increase penalties for employers who deliberately mis-classify employees as self-employed. </p>  <p>  There is no easy solution to the issue of deciding employment status &ndash; if there were, the Courts would have ruled on it years ago. There are complex legal aspects to it and each case rests on its own facts. I also need to be mindful of the constitutional rights of employers and workers to manage their business and freely choose their employment status.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to finalise the Guidance document and the legislative proposals and I hope to progress these as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I am advised that case involving an airline was investigated and decided upon and it is currently on appeal with the Social Welfare Appeals Office. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on the likely outcome of this case.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The estimated expenditure on WFP in 2018 is approximately &euro;430 million and as of May 2019 it is currently paid to almost 53,000 families in respect of approximately 119,000 children.</p>  <p>  For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for WFP and working on a casual basis (that is, up to and including 3 days per week) the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) scheme provides in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.  </p>  <p>  Apart from the jobseeker schemes if a person cannot meet the 19 hours WFP threshold or if their hours vary significantly from week to week, the Department offers a number of other schemes which can provide income support that can be combined with earnings from employment, subject to each individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  These include One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST), and the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) scheme </p>  <p>  Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have potentially significant expenditure implications which are difficult to quantify. The number of families working between 15-18 hours and are earning below the relevant WFP thresholds is currently unknown.  Therefore, I am advised that my Department has no way of accurately estimating the cost of reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access WFP from 19 to 15 hours.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  The longer term goal of WFP, as an incentive to take up and remain in work, could be compromised if the nature of the work taken up is not sustainable.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As at end of June 2019, a total of 50 on-site inspections have been carried out at Seetec  service delivery locations around the country and these will continue for the duration of the JobPath contract. Inspections may be notified or un-notified and can focus on specific matters of interest or can be general oversight, as required.</p>  <p>  The inspections monitor compliance with the service level agreement and the contract generally, including, for example, the suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing levels, Irish language compliance, customer service and customer feedback, checking the client&rsquo;s Personal Progression Plan, Review Meetings compliance, the checking of Job Sustainment Fee Evidence Types and Exit Plans.</p>  <p>  As part of their contractual obligations, the provider is required to have a comprehensive Complaints Process and this is advertised in all Seetec office locations.  The process contains various levels of escalation, allowing complaints to be dealt with at a level appropriate to the concern. </p>  <p>  Should a customer remain dissatisfied having exhausted the contractor's Complaint Process, they can request my Department to carry out a review.  In this way it can be established if the complaint has been fully dealt with, and in a fair and reasonable manner.  If the customer remains dissatisfied following a review, they have the option to refer the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  As at end of June 2019, approximately 126,000 Jobseekers have engaged with the service provided  by Seetec, with  311 complaints received in total, 0.25 per cent.  I am advised that my Department is not aware of any complaint referred to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  To ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily from the customers perspective, my Department has commissioned regular Customer Satisfaction Surveys, the latest of which was completed at the end of 2018.  Since the surveys began in 2016, some 3,000 Seetec customers have responded to the surveys, which are conducted over the phone.  The  results have been overwhelmingly positive with overall satisfaction ranging from 76% to 81% satisfaction versus only 5% to 8% dissatisfaction over the 3 years.  All of the evidence available to my Department indicates that the experience of customers who have engaged with the JobPath service to date has been quite positive.  The results of the Customer Satisfaction Surveys are published on my Departments website www.welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that underperformance identified through audits and inspections or resulting from client feedback and satisfaction with the level of service offered by the Contractor or as a result of ongoing  quantitative assessment of actual performance as compared to the base level commitment, may result in the reduction in fees paid  of up to 15%.  Where the Contractor does not address the issue that gives rise to use of retention fees to the satisfaction of the Department, the Department has the right to terminate the contract.  There has been no instance where retention fees have been applied.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are numerous consent systems in Ireland which incorporate EIA and which are governed by separate pieces of legislation that are the responsibility of different Departments. In each such piece of legislation, the competent authority is identified as the body responsible for examining the Environmental Impact Assessment Report prepared and for carrying out the EIA. The competent authority then makes its decision on whether to give development consent for the project, having regard to its assessment. </p>  <p>  For example, the competent authority in respect of land use planning, pursuant to the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, is the relevant planning authority, or An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the case may be,  while  the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is the competent authority in respect of consents under the Foreshore Act 1933, as amended. In effect, the responsibility as competent authority is appropriately assigned to a specified authority in the context of each relevant consent system.</p>  <p>  As regards EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive), the Directive has been transposed into Irish law by two sets of statutory instruments: the European Communities (Environmental Assessment of Certain Plans and Programmes) Regulations 2004, as amended, and the Planning and Development (Strategic Environmental Assessment) Regulations 2004, as amended.  </p>  <p>  The former Regulations do not identify specific authorities as competent authorities, but rather specify that &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; means the authority which is, or the authorities which are jointly, responsible for the preparation of a plan or programme, or modification to a plan or programme pursuant to the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The latter Regulations designate planning authorities as the competent authority for the preparation or variation of a statutory development plan or the preparation of a local area plan, and regional authorities are designated as competent authorities for the preparation of regional planning guidelines, where environmental assessment of the plan is required, in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p>  <p>  While the revised draft guidelines had been expected to be published in Quarter 1 2019, some delays to the planned schedule arose, due to the recent publication of updated World Health Organisation (WHO) noise standards and the need to focus on certain Brexit-related planning issues. </p>  <p>  As part of the SEA process, there will shortly be an 8-week public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report. Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. My Department will aim to commence the public consultation later in Q3 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

At the end of Quarter 1 2019, there were just over 45,900 households having their housing needs met via HAP.  </p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme for social housing tenants more generally. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that; </p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;</p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and</p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own separate differential rent scheme or schemes in operation. As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other. This is particularly the case when it comes to what may or may not be considered as reckonable/assessable income for rent purposes e.g., disability allowance and carer's allowance. </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for the Minister to introduce a national rents framework for social housing tenants. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, to ensure that rent schemes are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market. The general over-arching principle that rents should be related to incomes will be maintained. </p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future, at which point I will consider what proposals might be brought to Government as part of a wider social housing reform package of measures, that would continue to ensure that housing support goes to those who need it most within a system that is responsive to people&rsquo;s changing needs and circumstances. I hope to finalise this matter by the end of Q3 2019.</p></reply>

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the relevant recommendations made in the Review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be progressed as part of that process. Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, in that context, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources. </p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way.

The main provisions in the Act relate to : </p>  <p>  - Making it a criminal offence for landlords to implement rent increases that contravene the law, that do not adhere to new definitions of a substantial change, failure to cooperate with an investigation, failure to register and update tenancies with the RTB.</p>  <p>  - Providing powers to the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with the rent increase restriction in RPZs. </p>  <p>  - Allowing the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made.</p>  <p>   The exemptions from the 4% p.a. rent increase restriction in RPZs have been revised so to apply only to the first rent setting, rather than to every rent setting, during the period of RPZ designation in respect of a new rental property, including a property that had not been rented in the 2 year period immediately prior to the commencement of a particular tenancy. </p>  <p>   A definition is also provided to illustrate the type of works that qualify for the exemption from the rent increase restriction in respect of a substantial change in the nature of the rental property</p>  <p>   There are a number of reasons why the average rent in RPZs may be higher than the 4% rent increase cap, such as exemptions for properties that are new to the market and/or properties that  have undergone substantial change as well as possible non-compliance with the legislation. The introduction of the RTB's new powers of investigation and the related sanctions regime, which came into effect from 1 July 2019, will allow the RTB to investigate, sanction and enforce where non compliance is found. A number of authorised officers have been recruited and are now in place along with management and support staff.  Additional resources will join the team following a recruitment campaign. The RTB are  now accepting cases where improper conduct suspected.  </p>  <p>   Increased Exchequer funding of over &euro;7m was secured for 2019 for RTB operational costs to provide for the rising demand for RTB services and the implementation of the new functions contained in the RTA 2019 Act.  This is 60% higher than the 2018 provision of just under &euro;4.4m. </p>  <p>   The deployment of staff within the RTB to particular functions is a matter for the RTB itself. However, arrangements have been put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas and, in that regard, the RTB may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie.</p></reply>

My Department is currently following up with the remaining local authorities to ensure that the remaining Schemes of Priority are finalised.</p><p>Further regulations are currently in development, specifically in relation to the assessment of eligibility of households for affordable housing and any income limits to be set. Once these regulations have been made, associated guidance will issue to local authorities.</p><p>To support the delivery of affordable homes to buy or rent the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure support for the delivery of over 6,000 dwellings.  The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was specifically targeted at 11 local authorities, where the greatest affordability pressures exists.  In December 2018, approval in principle was announced for funding for 10 infrastructure projects, in Dublin and Cork, with an allocated budget of &euro;43 million. This will support the delivery of approximately 1,400 affordable homes. The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. </p><p>After this first call, local authorities were asked to complete further financial/economic assessments of each of their areas to assess whether provision of affordable homes is economically viable. A second call for proposals under the SSF issued on 9 April 2019 to 19 local authorities, based on the aforementioned economic assessments submitted. 31 responses were received from 15 local authorities under this call and, following the completion of the assessments of these,  I intend to issue approvals  in the coming weeks.</p><p>The SSF will also play an important role in making cost rental projects as affordable as possible. My Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental. This is being informed by the learning from two pilot cost rental projects, one of which, at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown, is just commencing construction, with first homes anticipated to come on stream from 2021, with a second, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore, at an earlier stage.</p><p>My Department is also engaging with the Land Development Agency (LDA), which is examining the potential to deliver Cost Rental homes at scale from its land portfolio and the broader State land bank. The initial portfolio of sites that the Agency has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.</p><p>There is also capacity to deliver up to 2,350 further affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands supported through the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).  An additional c. 5,600 homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market. Details of these LIHAF schemes and their locations are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>These schemes will complement other key Government affordability initiatives, such as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have supported some 13,000 households.</p></reply>

The retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the firefighter role.  The retirement age for retained firefighters is 55, with provision for an annual extension up to 58 years of age, subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment.</p>  <p>  International research indicates that a retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure that firefighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them. The retirement age of 55 was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job.  Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and underpinned by subsequent legislation, every fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the relevant trade unions in November 2002. The collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which would advise on the retirement age for retained firefighters. The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age. A circular was subsequently issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.</p>  <p>  In general any changes proposed by either management or trade unions are negotiated using the established industrial relations process. In this regard, the matter of increasing the age of firefighters was included as part  of recent preliminary discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU representing firefighters.</p></reply>

Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as appropriate, are required to have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions. </p><p>The Guidelines recommend, in section 3.32, that apartment schemes should provide storage for bulky items outside individual units (i.e. at ground or basement level). Secure, ground floor storage space allocated to individual apartments and located close to the entrance to the apartment block or building is particularly useful and planning authorities should encourage the provision of such space in addition to minimum apartment storage requirements. This form of storage may be used for equipment such as, for example, bicycles or bicycle equipment, children&rsquo;s outdoor toys or buggies. However, such storage does not satisfy bicycle parking requirements. </p><p>The Guidelines further recommend, in section 3.33, that where secure, allocated ground or basement level storage is provided, it may be used to satisfy up to half of the minimum storage requirement for individual apartment units, but shall not serve to reduce the minimum floor area required to be provided within each individual apartment unit, as set out in these guidelines. This is intended to enable greater flexibility in apartment design, whereby more living or bedroom space may be provided within the apartment unit in lieu of a portion of required internal storage space where such storage space has been provided elsewhere in the building. </p><p>The 2018 Guidelines are available to view on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Capital funding totalling &euro;1,000,000 was awarded to local authorities for six towns in 2019.  The successful towns are Ballina, Boyle, Kilrush, Letterkenny, Navan and Nenagh. Matching funding of at least 20% of total project expenditure is required for each project funded. The relevant local authority has been awarded significant capital funding towards the project referred to by the deputy. Funding for current or operational expenditure is not, however, provided under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The best advice for the group would be to contact the local authority directly; both the conservation officer and the heritage officer would be best placed to advise on the various types of additional funding that may be available. Alternatively, the Department of Rural and Community Development may be in a position to assist through some of their programmes including LEADER. </p>  <p>  While there are no specific plans at present to revise the HTI, my Department recently engaged in a public consultation process on Heritage Ireland 2030, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a revitalised and refreshed National Heritage Plan.

This is the first time that such a measure has been initiated  by my Department. The measure represents the outworking of the commitment made under action 2.16 of the Government&rsquo;s Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022<b></b>don Ghaeilge (Irish Language Action Plan 2018-2022<b>)</b>, which was published in June 2018 following Government approval and is being implemented on an ongoing basis by relevant stakeholders including my Department.</p><p>The scholarship fund is being  administered nationally by the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board (GRETB) in conjunction with the Department. As a result of this practical measure, 50 students, who may not have this opportunity otherwise,  are being provided with the opportunity to attend Irish summer college and avail of the language learning and enrichment opportunities this presents. I understand that the scholarship fund has been fully subscribed for this year. </p><p>In addition, and in overall support of providing learning opportunities for second-level students, my department  provides  specific grant-aid under the scheme by way of a further measure called: &Aacute;RANN Gaeltachta.<b></b>Under this measure  - which is in operation since 2007, specific grant-aid is provided<b></b>to qualifying households  on the Aran Islands who provide accommodation for students attending one of the three island-based post-primary schools for an entire school-year. 40 students availed of the measure in 2017, while 30 students per year have availed of the measure in the intervening period - in line with the maximum number allocated under the terms of  the measure. </p><p>I might also mention that I recently announced  the provision of a new fund worth &euro;250,000 which will facilitate new opportunities for third-level students to spend three months in the Gaeltacht. Under ERASMUS Gaeltachta, a subsidy worth &euro;17 per day will be provided to enable third-level institutions to offer a semester in the Gaeltacht to their students. Similar to the other aforementioned measures, this subsidy is payable to those providing accommodation under the terms of Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge.  The fund is expected to accommodate up to 175 students and represents progress in relation to measures 2.13, 2.15 and 2.19 of the Action Plan. </p><p>In the interest of completeness, I should say  that I am aware that scholarships are provided by various Irish language, cultural and sports organisations, as well as by several local authorities. I am also aware that some of the Irish colleges themselves offer part scholarships to students.</p><p>I am satisfied that these measures provide significant language-learning opportunities for young people; have the same or similar effect as scholarships; align with the key principles of social inclusion - as relevant; and generate substantial down-stream economic benefits for Gaeltacht regions.</p></reply>
