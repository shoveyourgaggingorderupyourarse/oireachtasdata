We discussed the general Covid 19 situation and our respective experiences in seeking to contain the virus and manage its impacts.   We shared information on our respective plans to start easing restrictionsas well as our respective approaches to related travel restrictions. We also considered recent Brexit developments during the course of our conversation.  </p>  <p>  I also spoke with First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill on Friday, 15th May, when I informed them of the Government plans to start easing the Covid related restrictions from the 18th of May as set out in the Roadmap.  We also discussed ongoing North South cooperation on dealing with Covid and the Memorandum of Understanding agreed to underpin and strengthen North South co-operation on the public health response to the pandemic. I also explained our expectation that passengers from overseas would complete a locator form and self isolate for 14 days.  Passengers transiting to Northern Ireland would be exempt from these arrangements.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing North South and East West engagement on Covid responses across government at both political and official level.  We will continue to seek opportunities for common or similar approaches to managing Covid, where that would be beneficial.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700112#WRB02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 17 together.</p>  <p>  As part of its response to the global Covid pandemic, on 5 April, 2020 the United Nations Secretary General directed the suspension of all rotations and leave for military personnel serving in UN missions until 30 June, effective immediately. </p>  <p>  The UN direction impacted over 100,000 UN uniformed personnel from over 120 countries serving world-wide, including Ireland and Defence Forces personnel serving with UN missions. The suspension was based on the protection of local communities as well as that of the peacekeepers during the Covid pandemic.     </p>  <p>  The UN directed that only in certain very limited and extenuating circumstances would any exemption be allowed. This was only where a rotation was vital to maintain a critical operational capability and where the requisite quarantine requirements for incoming and rotating contingents required by the UN and the host state can also be guaranteed.  Any such exemption was subject to a decision by the UN Headquarters in New York on a proposal from the Force Commander.  </p>  <p>  Immediately upon the direction of the UN Secretary General, the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade engaged with the UN in the mission areas and at UN Headquarters, though both informal and formal contacts to ensure that the rotation of Irish personnel would be achieved as close as possible to the scheduled dates.  </p>  <p>  On foot of these efforts, rotations to UNDOF, MINUSMA, KFOR and EUTM Mali have been successfully concluded to date. The Department and the Defence Forces are currently progressing options to rotate 2 personnel deployed to the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>  <p>   However, from the outset, the key focus has been on UNIFIL. As our largest mission, it involves the rotation of a significant number of personnel in two stages, is thus more complex, and requires approvals and permissions from both the UN and from the Host State, not least in terms of their health status and that of the local population in a time of a global pandemic health restrictions.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with the process laid down by the UN Secretary General, a submission was made by the Defence Forces through the Senior Irish Officer to the UNIFIL Force Commander seeking an exemption.  The Chief of Staff both wrote to and spoke to the Force Commander.  In tandem with this, the Department of Foreign Affairs through our Permanent Mission in New York engaged with UN Headquarters at senior level.  </p>  <p>  I can now advise that the UN has agreed to an exemption of the suspension for Ireland which will allow Ireland to rotate its full contingent to UNIFIL during the UN moratorium.  The first rotation has now been confirmed by the UN for 21 June and the second for 29 June.</p>  <p>  As the dates for the rotations have now been confirmed by the UN, I hope that this will now ease the impact of the delayed reunion with families.  The confirmed dates have been communicated by the military authorities to Defence Forces personnel coming home and those going out to Lebanon to commence their deployment.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with agreed arrangements, the United Nations will be responsible for making the transport arrangements for the rotation of UNIFIL troops in June.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700112#WRB02300"><p>My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The capital allocation for Defence is &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on the National Development Plan 2019 allocation.  The NDP - Project Ireland 2040 - provides financial allocations for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides that Ireland's ongoing active participation in a range of peacekeeping and crisis management missions is a key policy requirement. While each mission has elements of danger, it is the Government's position that all actions should be taken to minimise threats to the safety of personnel. Armoured vehicles provide essential force protection and, in this context in accordance with the equipment planning process, the fleet of armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  Twenty four (24) 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in late 2017. A multi-year mid-life upgrade of the Army's fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers is underway which will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. To date, thirty eight (38) upgraded vehicles have been delivered, with the remainder due by early 2022. In addition in 2018 the Defence Forces took delivery of ten (10) new armoured logistic vehicles at a cost of &euro;7.1m including VAT. These measures will provide essential force protection for personnel overseas. </p>  <p>  There is focus on the essential force protection provided by armoured vehicles, and in this regard a requirement for additional 4x4 armoured utility vehicles has been identified and subject to consideration of a business case and assessment of associated cost, funding will be made available. At this time there are no plans for the purchase of 15 additional armoured logistic vehicles (described by the Deputy as combat support service armoured 8 x 8 drop vehicles) for the Defence Forces. As such, it is not possible to estimate accurately the cost of such vehicles in the absence of a relevant specification and market assessment which, as indicated, does not currently arise</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. </p></reply>

The rotation of these personnel was further extended by three months.</p>  <p>  As the deployment of the personnel has been extended beyond their initial six month deployment, there is a requirement to extract them as soon as possible to allow for a medical assessment of the officers.</p>  <p>  Given the urgency of the situation,  both the Department and the Defence Forces are considering all available options to secure the return of these personnel at the earliest possible opportunity.  However, there are a number of complexities that remain to be worked through, such as the transport of their weapons and ammunition.</p>  <p>  My position is very clear on the matter;  the timely extraction of these members of the Defence Forcesshould take precedence over any other secondary issue such as the treatment of weapons.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the uncertainty around rotation dates is difficult for the individuals themselves and their families, and I would like to offer reassurance that my priority is the quick and safe return of these two officers.</p></reply>

Capability equipment requirements are kept under on-going review in the light of present and expected operational needs.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence provides for the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32m plus VAT for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna FR 172H fleet. The contract is well underway and it is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered in 2020.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, an additional Pilatus PC-12 NG aircraft was acquired at a cost of &euro;4.2m plus VAT.  This aircraft provides the Air Corps with immediate additional fixed wing capacity to meet the unique situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. Following a tender competition a contract was awarded to Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019 for delivery of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft in 2023 at a cost of some &euro;180 plus VAT. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on the 2019 NDP allocation. The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to continue the programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included for funding.</p></reply>

The UN is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and our engagement in multilateralism receives strong political and public support.  Our effort to secure a seat, following the announcement of our candidature in 2005, reflects this.  I am particularly conscious that we are seeking a seat at a time when multilateralism is under pressure.  It is my strong belief that, in these circumstances, it is important that Ireland should demonstrate its willingness to participate in the work of multilateral institutions.  I know this view is widely shared across the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The expected date of the election for the two available seats in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) for the UN Security Council term 2021-2022 is 17 June. There has been no change in this date despite the COVID-19 related restrictions in place at the UN. While the arrangements for voting by representatives of Member States will have to be modified to take account of social distancing, it is the intention of the President of the General Assembly to proceed with the election on the planned date.  </p>  <p>  The contest for the two available seats is very competitive.  Our competitors, Canada and Norway, are strong members of the UN and important bilateral partners.  We enjoy excellent relations with both and cooperate on many issues at the UN and beyond.  </p>  <p>  In making our case to the 192 other Members States of the UN, we are highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of active membership.  We have a strong record at the UN in the areas of peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights. Ireland last served on the Council from 2001-2002.</p>  <p>  Throughout the campaign, there has been high level political engagement with the UN Member States to promote and discuss Ireland&rsquo;s candidature.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been mobilised in support of the candidature, in coordination with other Departments as appropriate. These efforts will continue until the election is completed.</p></reply>

However, the impact of the virus is likely to fall hardest on communities already experiencing humanitarian crises, displacement, or weak health systems. </p>  <p>  The situation in Syria is particularly worrying. Nine years of civil war have decimated the country&rsquo;s health care system and left Syria poorly equipped to face COVID-19. Testing capacities are limited and there are significant shortages of personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  COVID-19 requires a collective, coordinated, global response.  Ireland's priority is to provide vital support to the multilateral system's efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the most vulnerable countries, on the basis that &ldquo;nobody is safe until everybody is safe.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation, part of the UN system, is at the centre of that global response, working to control the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact. Recognising the WHO's important role, Ireland was the first country to contribute to the WHO COVID-19 appeal.  This appeal has since been rolled into the UN Global Humanitarian Response Plan, which aims at a coherent response across the UN system to COVID-19.  Ireland is also part of Team Europe, the EU's response to the pandemic.  That collective response, focusing on global leadership and unity, remains at the heart of Ireland's approach.</p>  <p>  The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s funding to the WHO&rsquo;s COVID-19 appeal has been allocated at the global level, allowing the WHO to prioritise additional resources wherever needs are greatest. As with all humanitarian funding, Ireland and other donors insist that these resources are allocated on the basis of need alone, and in line with the humanitarian principles of independence, impartiality, neutrality and humanity. This means that in Syria, those in need should receive assistance, whether they are in Government or opposition controlled areas. </p>  <p>  As well as the additional needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is vital for donors to continue to support the millions of people who remain in need of humanitarian assistance, and those needs are acute in Syria. Ireland will provide over &euro;24 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis in 2020. This will bring our overall contribution to more than &euro;168 million since 2012, our largest response to any single crisis.</p></reply>

In this spirit, the EU has engaged in a series of unprecedented measures to address the health and socio-economic consequences of the coronavirus crisis. The European Commission is expected to present proposals for a revised MFF and a Recovery Fund linked to the MFF shortly. This revised MFF with a Recovery Fund will be the fourth pillar of the EU&rsquo;s economic response to the pandemic. The first three pillars agreed by the Eurogroup and endorsed by the European Council on 23 April are the SURE guarantee for unemployment, the EIB guarantee fund for SMEs and ESM credit lines for Member States. At their meeting on 23 April, the European Heads of State and Government agreed to work towards establishing a Recovery Fund which &ldquo;shall be of a sufficient magnitude, targeted towards the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected, and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  In her speech to the European Parliament on 13 May, Commission President von der Leyen set out the Commission thinking on the Recovery Fund which suggests that recovery planning will need to include massive public and private investment at European and national level. The entirety of the Recovery Fund will be channelled through EU programmes, both new and existing programmes which work well. President von der Leyen has also been consulting with EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, on the proposed Recovery Fund. It is not clear at this stage exactly how the Recovery Fund will be allocated to the different Member States, including Ireland, or which precise sectors will be covered. However, in her speech to the Parliament, the Commission President indicated that the Fund would be channelled through 3 pillars: a new Recovery and Resilience tool, plus top-ups to Cohesion, allocated based on the severity of the economic and social impacts of the crisis; a strengthened InvestEU and a new Strategic Investment Facility; and strengthened key programmes to address the COVID-19 crisis as well as a new health programme. </p>  <p>  France and Germany also made a joint proposal for the design of the Fund based on the Commission borrowing &euro;500 billion raised using the EU budget. This is only one proposal for the Fund, but I note its importance. The European Commission is due to release new proposals on the EU recovery fund today (27 May 2020) which will provide more detail. We will engage positively with the Commission&rsquo;s proposals and work for early agreement.</p></reply>

This announcement - implementing a commitment by the British Government at the time of the New Decade New Approach agreement in January - is important progress and it is happening because of this individual's tireless campaign, which has come at considerable personal expense.</p><p>The people of Northern Ireland should never need to affirm or renounce British or Irish citizenship in order to access an entitlement based on the other &ndash; which is what the individual in question was asked to do. </p><p>The Citizenship and Identity provisions are central to the Good Friday Agreement and it is vital that they are upheld, and that the people of Northern Ireland can have full confidence in them. The Government has consistently engaged with the British Government in support of this, and we will continue to do so. Those provisions of course put obligations on both the British and Irish Governments.</p><p>We will continue to work, with the British Government, to enhance confidence in the effectiveness of these important provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>Brexit has raised particular concerns for people in Northern Ireland on whether citizenship could create differential entitlements. The EU rights of Irish and therefore EU citizens from Northern Ireland are specifically addressed in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement. The Protocol confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits&rdquo; that come with EU citizenship. Irish citizens will continue to have EU citizenship wherever they live. They will continue to enjoy the right to travel and live and work anywhere in the EU and the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality.  </p><p>In March, the Joint Committee of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission published a paper on <i>&lsquo;Continuing EU Citizenship Rights, Opportunities and Benefits in Northern Ireland after Brexit&rsquo;</i>.</p><p>That paper is a valuable contribution and the Government is giving careful consideration to it and the Joint Committee&rsquo;s views, as we would hope the British Government will do. In addition to the proposals in that paper, there may also be other options to consider on enhancing confidence in the effectiveness of these important provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>Both Governments have committed to addressing issues relating to the Citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement through the framework of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The BIIGC is an important forum for taking these issues forward, and we will do so, informed by the Joint Committee's paper. Ireland will also play its role as an EU Member State in relation to the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

I have worked consistently to maintain an international focus on the issue and support for the two state solution and have undertaken four working visits to Israel and Palestine. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains ready to support any peace initiative that respects the international parameters for a two-state solution and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and provides a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples. </p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process is regularly discussed in meetings of EU Foreign Ministers, and was addressed again in a Ministerial videoconference meeting on 15 May. In advance of that meeting, I and senior officials in my Department discussed the issue with a large number of EU Member States to encourage a clear and united position, particularly on the matter of annexation. I welcome the very clear statements that have been made on the issue by EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell. </p>  <p>  Ireland has long worked to keep attention on Gaza. In my most recent visit to Gaza in December 2019, I saw for myself the impact the blockade is having. Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in Gaza. I have initiated an Irish-funded solar power project in Gaza, which will help improve water quality in the area. More recently, my Department allocated additional funding to support the medical response to COVID 19 in the Gaza Strip. </p>  <p>  However, the roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. What is needed is the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume. Gaza faces other challenges, including oppressive rule by Hamas, but the blockade dominates peoples&rsquo; lives in Gaza to such an extent that it is difficult to address other issues. I have raised the issue of the blockade with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. </p>  <p>  I will continue to make every effort to ensure that the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in Gaza remain high on the international agenda. </p></reply>

This is a statutory requirement contained in sections 3 and 16 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).  Section 2 of the Act defines the "liability date" of a given year as the 1 November of the preceding year. </p>  <p>  Liability for Local Property Tax (LPT) arises where a person owns a residential property on a liability date, which for 2014 and subsequent years is 1 November. Thus, liability for the year 2020 was established on 1 November 2019 and the person who was the liable person in relation to a property on this date is required to pay the LPT liability for the full year 2020, regardless of whether the ownership of the property changes during that year and before the following liability date of 1 November 2020 (for the year 2021). However, while liability is to be established on 1 November in a year, the LPT does not have to be paid until the following year. </p>  <p>  There are good reasons why liability is established before the start of the relevant year and why the tax charge is not apportioned over a year between two different owners where a property is sold during a year. Having a single liability date provides certainty about who is responsible for payment and avoids disputes about the number of days for which different property owners might be liable.  The period between the liability date at the beginning of November and the end of a year, allows the taxpayer time to put different types of phased payment arrangements in place for the following year such as direct debit or deduction at source from a person&rsquo;s salary or occupational pension.  </p>  <p>  In many cases where a property is being sold, the seller is also purchasing a replacement property around the same time. While such a person may end up having to pay LPT in respect of the property being sold, the LPT for the property being purchased is likely, depending on the date of sale, to end up being paid by the previous owner. The net result for each party to the sale is the payment of LPT on a single property.  Furthermore, now that LPT has become an established tax it has become common practice, as part of sale/purchase negotiations, for sellers and purchasers of residential properties to take the ongoing LPT liability of the seller into account and to adjust the sales price accordingly so that, in effect, the purchaser ends up paying the LPT liability for the part of the year for which he or she owns the property. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.125.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700113#WRC06200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39, 43, 51, 56, 70, 79 and 86 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a temporary emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, intended to maximise staff retention and firm viability by maintaining the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible through this truly exceptional period.  In that regard, it is noted that, as of 25 May, almost 56,300 employers and over 482,800 employees have thus far benefited from the measure.  </p>  <p>  It ultimately gives a sum to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  The sum the employer receives is based on the employees who were on their payroll on 29 February 2020, the net salary such employees received in January and February 2020, as well as the extent to which the employer remains able to continue to discharge their legal obligation to pay their employees&rsquo; salaries.</p>  <p>  The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue.  One of the core principles of the scheme that is necessary to prevent abuse is the requirement that the employees for which a claim is submitted must be on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after 29 February 2020, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, whether maternity related or otherwise, that salary cannot be included in the calculation of the sum that is available to the employer under the TWSS.</p>  <p>  The 29 February payroll decision has consequences for many groups, however, the scheme is being administered in a manner that is fully compliant with all relevant legislation and no discriminatory treatment of workers arises.  </p>  <p>  Further, the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay.  The question of an individual&rsquo;s employment entitlements following their resumption of work after a period of leave, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer &ndash; and the entire period of pregnancy and maternity leave is a special protected period under the law.  </p>  <p>  It is understood that although the employer may not be able to claim the TWSS for a person who has not been on the payroll on 29 February but is entitled to return to work after this date, they remain obliged to honour their obligations as an employer as the full suite of employment rights legislation continues to apply in relation to all employees and their employers for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.</p>  <p>  As regards the operation of the TWSS, I am aware of the matter that has been raised by the Deputies and I have instructed officials to re-examine whether such workers may be accommodated at this time within the scheme.</p></reply>

Whether a person&rsquo;s property insurance provides cover for such claims will depend on the specifics of his/her insurance policy, and it is possible that some policies may cover such claims, but it is also likely that others will not. In addition, on renewal it is possible that many insurers will change their terms and conditions to exclude any claims for COVID-19. It should be noted however that neither I, nor the Central Bank, have any influence over the decisions of insurers in relation to the provision of such cover.</p>  <p>  With regards to the Deputy&rsquo;s point that individuals may claim against property owners if they allege that they have contracted COVID-19 on their property, the only comment I would make is that it may be difficult to prove where a person caught the virus in the first place, therefore taking such actions may not be straightforward, and even if initiated, there can be no guarantee of a successful outcome. For now, I believe that the best way that a business can protect itself from litigation is to follow public health guidelines and implement social distancing measures.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there have been some suggestions that the State should provide an indemnity to re-opening businesses for COVID-19 claims in circumstances where they have not been able to get any insurance cover. However, I believe that it would be financially unsustainable for the State to provide such a blanket indemnity for all litigation relating to COVID-19 outbreaks, there would also be a significant moral hazard in doing so and could also be wider unintended consequences in the insurance market.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on insurance issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland, Insurance Ireland and the sector on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020. </p><p>Accordingly, the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an employer has not met its statutory PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020, then the employer is not eligible to participate in the scheme.  These requirements of the TWSS were critical safeguards against abuse and exploitation of the scheme. PAYE legislation requires employers to report their payroll to Revenue in real time as the payroll is run.</p><p>Arising from the ongoing review of specific cases since the TWSS started, it became apparent to Revenue that a number of employers were unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.

In the context of the need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.   </p>  <p>  The key conditions of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, although this was extended recently to 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.   </p>  <p>  The TWSS is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up and can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020. The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020. There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Moreover, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.  </p>  <p>  The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational system reasons, the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.  </p>  <p>  The question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context following his or her resumption of duty after a period of leave, whether paid or unpaid, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS.</p></reply>

On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on the 27th of March and indicated amongst other things the following:</p><p>(i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  </p><p>(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed, as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on the 3rd of April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. </p><p>Following on from my correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on the 17th of April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly. I also discussed a range of other insurance related matters on the teleconference, including motor insurance premium refunds, and a statement outlining the nature of my engagement with Insurance Ireland was issued by the Department and can be found here: </p><p>In addition, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. The key messages that the Bank conveyed are as follows:</p><p>- Insurers must put forward consumer-focussed solutions on policy payment breaks, rebates and claims. </p><p>- While most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. </p><p>- The Central Bank expects the CEOs of Irish authorised firms to take responsibility for the oversight of how their firm is managing determinations of whether claims are covered or not in the context of COVID-19. </p><p>The CBI is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p><p>In conclusion, I have set out already to the House that I strongly believe that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and honour those elements of the policies covered including business interruption claims in line with the CBI&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  However, I cannot compel insurers to pay business interruption claims and neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank, have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. bringing the matter to the attention of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or seeking to go down the litigation route.  In this regard, I note that a number of legal actions have been initiated by some publicans.  Notwithstanding these constraints, my officials are maintaining regular contact with Insurance Ireland on this and other issues and are keeping me updated on developments.  Furthermore, I have also recently indicated in the Dail, that I intend engaging again directly with Insurance Ireland in the near future.</p></reply>

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the Government objective of getting assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced in response to this Public Health emergency. </p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. A key element of the eligibility is that the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020. This requirement together with the other eligibility requirements for the TWSS were particularly designed as safeguards against abuse of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the relevant employer as at 29 February 2020.  Craft Apprentices alternate between &lsquo;on-the-job&rsquo; training with an employer and &lsquo;off-the-job training&rsquo; in an education centre.  The employer pays the Apprentice while she/he is being trained &lsquo;on-the-job&rsquo; and a training allowance is paid through the Education Shared Business Services Unit of the Department of Education and Skills while the Apprentice is attending &lsquo;off-the-job&rsquo; training. </p>  <p>  Eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible Apprentice who was on the payroll at 29 February 2020.  Apprentices who were not on the payroll of the employer at 29 February 2020 are not eligible employees for the purposes of the TWSS. Furthermore, the wage subsidy per employee is calculated based on the net pay reported by the employer for January and February 2020. The scheme does not distinguish between periods in &lsquo;off-the-job&rsquo; training where the Apprentice was not in receipt of a wage from the employer and was not therefore reported on the payroll of the employer and so from an operational standpoint the employer would have no basis period on which to base the wage subsidy. Accordingly, the TWSS can only operate in respect of an Apprentice, who is on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  </p>  <p>  The question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context following his or her resumption of duty after a period of training, and the question of what wage amount an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an Apprentice in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS.  Those employees who are laid off following such a resumption of duty would be entitled to claim the Pandemic Unemployment Payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed having regard to the Government objective of providing assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the Covid 19 pandemic and the restrictions which were introduced as a result. The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce. The sector to which the Deputy refers is no different in this regard. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the TWSS is concerned was and is to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for and start to receive payment quickly. The objective of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed.  </p><p>A key eligibility criterion for the scheme requires that where a business is experiencing a significant negative economic disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the employer must make a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, as a result of disruption to the business caused (or to be caused) by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic; and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully, but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.  </p><p>An employer that has been hit by a significant decline in business but has strong cash reserves, which are not required to fund debt, may still qualify for the scheme, but the Government would expect such an employer to continue to pay some element of employees&rsquo; wages.  Thus, where a business has been forced to close due to public health requirements resulting in future turnover declining by at least 25%, it is expected that such an employer would be eligible for the TWSS.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, outside of the TWSS, there is a wide range of financial supports and guidance available to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

These arrangements are available to all businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, including professionals such as dentists who have been unable to trade due to Covid-19.However, the VAT measure would not be relevant to dentists, whose activity is exempt from VAT (under Schedule 1 Paragraph 2(5) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010).</p><p>These measures are currently being operated by Revenue on an administrative basis.  Legislation will be introduced in due course to put the scheme on a statutory footing and to provide for a reduced statutory interest rate that will apply to payment of the warehoused debts:</p><p>- 0% for the &ldquo;Covid-19 restricted trading phase&rdquo;, the period when the business is unable to trade due to the Covid-19 related restrictions, and including the first two months after the business resumes trading;</p><p>- 0% for the &ldquo;zero interest&rdquo; phase, which lasts for 12 months after the end of the first phase;</p><p>- 3% per annum for the &ldquo;reduced interest phase&rdquo;, which begins after the end of the second phase</p><p>The warehousing measures currently operated by Revenue on an administrative basis, as well as the reduced statutory interest rate, are important support measures aimed at assisting all businesses, including dentists and other sole traders, who have been adversely affected by Covid-19.</p><p>Where a dentist or other professional is an employer, s/he may have availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) to make payments to employees.  This was provided for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The core principles of the scheme are that:</p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p><p>- the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  </p><p>- the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020. </p><p>The TWSS is predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picks up.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020.Regarding the subsidy amount, no distinction is made based on whether the business has closed due to Government restrictions or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work part-time or full-time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>As regards the personal tax liability of dentists or other self-employed individuals, a self-assessed income taxpayer is required to pay preliminary tax by 31 October in a year, or later if paying online via the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  The amount of the payment is</p><p>- 90% of the current year&rsquo;s liability;</p><p>- 100% of the prior year&rsquo;s liability; or</p><p>- 105% of the tax due for the tax year preceding the immediately previous tax year (often called the &lsquo;pre-preceding year&rsquo;).  </p><p>The &ldquo;pre-preceding year&rdquo; option only applies to taxpayers paying by direct debit.  Taxpayers not paying by direct debit can choose the lower of the other two options; in most cases 90% of this year&rsquo;s liability is likely to be considerably less than the previous year&rsquo;s liability.  </p><p>In addition, Revenue has confirmed that, to accelerate interim refunds of Professional Services Withholding Tax (PSWT) during the Covid-19 pandemic, they will accept refund claims via MyEnquiries where legible copies of the original F45 and F50 documents are attached.</p><p>Full details are available at  </p><p>Finally, sole traders may be eligible to apply to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment scheme.  </p></reply>

The scheme builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances for either employers or employees. The core principles of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, that the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020.  The latter two requirements in particular were critical safeguards against abuse of the scheme.    </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers had been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and are otherwise tax compliant.  Given the purpose and objectives of the scheme, Revenue announced on 24 April 2020, under its care and management provisions, that it would allow such employers access the scheme provided: </p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020, </p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and  </p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a business qualifies for the scheme under the revised criteria and makes the necessary declaration that it is significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, the wage subsidies under the scheme will be payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020. These revised arrangements cannot be made retrospective.  Where a business fails to meet the revised qualifying criteria for TWSS but wishes to further engage with Revenue on the matter, it must provide supporting evidence setting out the rationale for why it should be included in the scheme. This supporting documentation should be provided via Revenue&rsquo;s myEnquiries system.  </p>  <p>  As I have indicated, the PAYE reporting obligations built into the eligibility criteria for the TWSS were designed in particular to prevent abuse of the scheme.  It is not proposed to make any further concessions in relation to compliance with those reporting requirements for the purposes of qualification for the scheme.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.189.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700115#WRE00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 65 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is provided for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  </p>  <p>  The key prescribed conditions of the scheme are that &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative  economic impact due to the pandemic and is unable to pay normal wages to employees, but wishes to continue to employ the employees and is making best efforts to continue to pay some wages to the employees, </p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and</p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended to before the 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The amount of the temporary wage subsidy payable in relation to eligible employees is based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020 for each employee.  </p>  <p>  I clarified in my letter of 16 April 2020 to Revenue, which set out my determinations of the amounts of wage subsidy to be payable in relation to different classes of employees, that for the purposes of the operation of the TWSS, the Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay is the employee&rsquo;s average net weekly pay for January and February 2020 based on the payroll submissions made by the employer concerned to Revenue.  It is a matter for each employer concerned to decide what amount of normal wages should be paid to employees in addition to the wage subsidy amounts, and whether to try match the employees&rsquo; previous gross or net pay.  Ultimately, what employees are most concerned about is how near the aggregate of the wage subsidy amount plus whatever amount of normal wages is being paid net to them by employers is to their normal take home pay.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it has now implemented the revised rates of wage subsidy as determined by me on 16 April 2020, with the remainder to be implemented shortly. The revised rates apply as respects payroll notifications received by Revenue on or after 4 May 2020 in respect of payroll runs to be made on or after that date. The revised rate now implemented include:</p>  <p>  - the 85% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412,</p>  <p>  - non-tapering of the 85% subsidy where an employer contribution of more than 15% of the employees net weekly pay results in a salary payment of up to &euro;350 per week,</p>  <p>  - the flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but less than &euro;500,</p>  <p>  - the 70% subsidy rate for employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;500 but less than &euro;586, with a maximum subsidy of &euro;410 applying,</p>  <p>  - a maximum payment of &euro;350 per week for employees whose average net weekly pay is greater than &euro;586 per week but not more than &euro;960 per week, subject to specific tapering reductions based on the employer contribution to the net weekly earnings. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the TWSS is operated in real-time by employers through the normal payroll process. To ensure that subsidy amounts are paid to employees on a timely basis as part of the relevant payroll run, it is necessary to calculate the amount of the subsidy due to an employee based on the employee&rsquo;s gross pay. This is necessary as an employee&rsquo;s net pay cannot be fully determined before the actual payroll is run. Revenue is aware that, in effect, this means that for some employees where the employer pays between (net weekly) &euro;586 and &euro;960, the full amount of the subsidy due to an employee may not be paid through the payroll run concerned.  However, Revenue has confirmed it will be implementing a system development to ensure that any subsidy amounts that remain due to such employees will be calculated, by Revenue, following the submission of the actual payroll or payrolls. Arrangements will then be made by Revenue to pay any outstanding subsidy amount directly to the employees concerned. The necessary system development to achieve this will be implemented shortly and will be applied retrospectively from 4 May 2020 to any impacted weekly, fortnightly or monthly paid employees. </p></reply>

I welcomed the ongoing work of the credit union sector to support members in difficulties due to COVID-19 and acknowledged the health and safety risk front line staff are facing every day to ensure continuity of services to members. I noted the vital work the credit union sector is carrying out, which builds on the government&rsquo;s call for solidarity and community spirit which is synonymous with credit unions. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my officials have had weekly calls with the credit union representative bodies and weekly engagement sessions with the Registry of Credit Unions in the Central Bank to review any emerging issues in the sector resulting from the pandemic, and to ensure smooth information flow between the sector and Government. The Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) is also meeting weekly.</p>  <p>  I recognise the key role that credit unions play in the delivery of financial services in local communities across Ireland, the need for which is heightened at this time. Credit unions account for approximately one third of the consumer credit market and are well positioned to provide access to credit to support the recovery from the current crisis.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the overall financial position of the sector, credit unions have come into this crisis with a strong reserves position, with a sector average reserve ratio of 16% as at 31 December 2019. This highlights that many individual credit union boards have chosen to prudently maintain additional reserves over the 10% regulatory minimum requirement. Credit unions have also maintained high levels of liquidity, with a sector average liquidity ratio of 39% as at 31 December 2019. Notwithstanding the strong financial position of the sector at December 2019, sustainability is a challenge for many credit unions.</p>  <p>  Generally speaking, the current business model of Irish credit unions is suffering from low growth rates in loan demand over recent years (outpaced by stronger savings growth). Surplus funds not lent out to members are appropriately not exposed to undue risk, and they yield limited investment returns reflective of the current low interest rate environment. The operational business model lacks scale efficiencies and suffers from high operating costs. This has translated into low loan to asset ratios (sector average 28%), low return on assets (sector average 0.6%) and high cost income ratios (sector average 82%).</p>  <p>  The economic outlook arising by virtue of COVID-19, including reduced demand for new lending, has increased the challenges the sector is already facing. As a result it was agreed that the CUAC would report to me by 30 June on challenges and opportunities for the sector, incorporating implications of COVID-19, the role credit unions could play in the economic recovery and any relevant recommendations.</p></reply>

Last month, the members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) announced their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses which require it.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers&rsquo; best interests and in line with regulatory requirements.  Payment breaks give customers the opportunity to postpone or reduce their repayments on their mortgage, personal or business loans, providing breathing space for borrowers from the severe income shock many households and businesses are experiencing.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has clearly communicated and agreed with the BPFI that it expects that at the end of the agreed payment break that borrowers who can return to full repayments be given, at the minimum, the option to either repay the loan within the remaining term or extend the term of the loan, without penalties noting that borrower circumstances and the appropriateness of each option may differ. These options may result in an increase in monthly repayments due to the overall increase in the cost of credit  and this should be fully explained to the borrower. Consumers can also find more information on payment breaks at the Central Bank&rsquo;s Covid &ndash; 19 Hub. </p></reply>

This scheme provides the payment of income supports to employers in respect of eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities have experienced significant negative disruption due to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p><p>The TWSS is operated by employers through their payroll system, thereby ensuring employees will be in receipt of the subsidy payment along with any other payments made by their employer. The employer must include the subsidy as part of employees&rsquo; wages and show the amount of the subsidy paid to the employee on the employee&rsquo;s payslip. </p><p>The key eligibility criteria for the scheme are that &ndash; </p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll <i>at 29 February 2020</i>and were included on a payroll submission in February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 1 April 2020. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that in relation to the person in respect of whom details are supplied, it is a matter for that person&rsquo;s employer to apply for the TWSS for this person through the submission of the employer&rsquo;s payroll to Revenue. In applying for the TWSS for this and other employees it is important that the PRSI Class J9 be used on the payroll submission for all employees for whom the TWSS is being sought. </p><p>An employer is required to issue a pay slip to each employee for each pay period. The employer is required to separately disclose the amount of the subsidy payment and any additional payment paid by the employer to the employee on the face of the pay slip document. The employee can verify each payment made by the employer by reference to the pay slip document issued by the employer.  </p><p>I am advised that Revenue has attempted to contact the person whose details were supplied by the Deputy and will continue to do so. The person can, if they wish, provide Revenue with a copy of their payslips for past pay periods and other relevant details to assist with the review procedures being undertaken by Revenue in this case. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.215.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700115#WRE03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 76 together.</p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was is provided for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  </p>  <p>  The TWSS is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.  Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the Government objective of providing assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced as a result of this Public Health emergency.</p>  <p>  It must be accepted that the TWSS cannot be adapted to meet the particular circumstances of individual employers or employees. The objective of the scheme is to ensure the key relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations once the crisis has passed. </p>  <p>  In the context of the need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  The key conditions of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash; </p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, although this deadline was extended recently to 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, it follows that the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible employees on their payroll, including rehired staff who were temporarily laid off.  Where an eligible employee previously laid off has been re-hired, the employee will qualify for the scheme once their claim for social welfare benefit (Pandemic Unemployment Benefit /Jobseekers Benefit) is ceased.   </p>  <p>  While the TWSS is payable to eligible staff that were rehired after 1 May 2020, I have been advised by Revenue that further IT development work was required to facilitate the processing of such cases. Revenue has completed this system development and the required technology is now in place. Revenue has confirmed that in excess of 30,000 employees have started or restarted employments since 1 May 2020, of which approximately 10,000 are &lsquo;rehired&rsquo; staff that are eligible for the TWSS. Employers who submitted payroll after 1 May for those &lsquo;rehired&rsquo; staff were processed for refund and the refund will be in employers&rsquo; bank accounts early this week. The system will pick-up and process additional re-hires on a daily basis that appear on payroll submissions.</p></reply>

The legislative requirements are that;</p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020.</p><p>The 15 March deadline in respect of the February 2020 payroll submission was recently extended to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April by Revenue in circumstances where all previous payroll submissions were filed before 15 March 2020. </p><p>The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through the PAYE system and as such is a fully automated solution that is designed around the legislative provisions. The scheme calculates the level of subsidy due based on the employee&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Average Revenue Net Weekly PAY&rsquo; (ARNWP) </i>during January and February 2020. The system cannot calculate a subsidy payment for employees that were not on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at 29 February.</p><p>I have been advised by Revenue that the person in question did not begin his current employment until 9 March 2020, which is outside of the specified dates provided in the legislation for the TWSS. For this reason, it was not possible for Revenue to provide his employer with access to the scheme on his behalf.</p></reply>

The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  Within the parameters of this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. A loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) has published Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.  The Central Bank has also indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

In their statement of the 26<sup>th</sup>March, leaders acknowledged that the pandemic constitutes an unprecedented challenge for Europe and the whole world and that it required urgent, decisive, and comprehensive action at the EU, national, regional and local levels. Leaders mandated the European Commission to bring forward proposals for a comprehensive recovery plan including plans for investment across the EU. The European Commission is expected to publish their proposals on 27<sup>th</sup>May. </p><p>On the 13<sup>th</sup>May, the President of the European Commission, President von der Leyen, made an address to the European Parliament in which she outlined that the Commission&rsquo;s proposed recovery package would consist of two parts; firstly, the EU Budget/the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and secondly, on top of the MFF, a recovery instrument to be funded through a larger headroom within the EU Budget. We await the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals.  </p><p>In the meantime, a number of Member States have published their views on what should be included in the Recovery Plan, how and where the expenditure should be targeted, whether support should be provided through loans and/or grants, whether conditions should be applied to Member States availing of the funding and how the recovery fund should be financed.</p><p>On 18<sup>th</sup>May, Chancellor Merkel and President Macron presented joint French and German proposals for European Recovery. The centrepiece of their proposals is a &euro;500 billion recovery fund for additional EU spending through the EU Budget, jointly borrowed on the markets, to provide financial support for the most affected sectors and regions on the basis of EU budget programmes and in line with European priorities. </p><p>The proposals made by France and Germany are an important contribution and a step in the right direction on Europe&rsquo;s recovery efforts. They are proposals from two Member States - we are assessing the detail of these proposals along with input from other Member States. Agreement on a way forward will require the approval of all 27 Member States.</p><p>The Recovery Fund must focus on the most pressing economic needs to reboot the economy once the health crisis has receded.  It should be temporary and targeted, prioritising sectors and regions that have been most impacted but also those that can generate and enable sustainable economic growth in the new normal of the post-Covid economy. In particular, it should be deployed to accelerate both the digital and green transitions in the EU. Equally, a recovery fund and other funding must create a future for business models that are viable.</p><p>Ireland will continue to engage positively in the MFF and recovery plan discussions and work with Member States and the institutions to build consensus for early agreement.  There are issues and matters, including those raised in the French and German proposals, that need careful consideration to assess the implications for Ireland. It will not be until then that we will fully know the specifics of the extent to which and how Member States can avail of funding for the MFF and the Recovery Fund. </p><p>The European Commission's proposals on the Post 2020 MFF and Recovery Fund will be the subject of detailed negotiations. When we have sight of their proposals, we will have a clearer understanding of the impacts of them for Ireland. </p><p>With regard to the tax proposals linked to the French and German proposed recovery fund, the Deputy will have noted that France, Germany and the European Commission have all expressed their support for the OECD process as the best forum in which to address issues arising in the field of international taxation.</p><p>Nevertheless, Commissioner Gentolini recently re-affirmed his intention to propose a new EU levy on digital services and a minimum corporate tax rate in 2021, if global negotiations fall short. While the Franco-German Initiative for European Recovery from the Coronavirus Crisis echoes this ambition, such moves will require the agreement of all Member States. The economic context has changed dramatically in recent months and all countries are now considering what impact the current crisis may have on their overall tax systems, which may influence their views on international tax issues.</p><p>Much progress has been made in the current discussions at OECD, and technical work at the OECD is continuing. The intention is to find political agreement for work on addressing tax and digitalisation by the end of 2020 and we remain focused on that goal.</p></reply>

The wage subsidy per employee is calculated based on the net pay reported for January and February 2020. The scheme does not distinguish between ordinary wages, shift allowances, overtime, bonuses or commission or between part-time or full-time employees. Moreover, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, it follows that the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after that date, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, he or she does not meet the eligibility criteria with the employer as he or she would not have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at that date. </p></reply>

Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act of 1997 provides for The Help to Buy scheme (HTB) which was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  HTB was due to terminate on 31 December 2019, however, in Finance Act 2019 I provided for an extension of the scheme, in its present form, for a further two-year period up to 31 December 2021. This extension aligns with the timeline envisaged for building more homes in Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current crisis. One of the main aims of the policy underpinning the design of HTB was to help encourage the building of additional new properties. By restricting the scheme solely to new dwellings and new self-builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes will encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.  </p>  <p>  If the scheme were also available for second hand properties, it would have little or no effect on the provision of additional supply, and this would consist primarily of &lsquo;economic deadweight&rsquo; in terms of incentive effect. Economic deadweight is an important consideration which is taken into account when evaluating new tax incentive measures and refers to the amount of activity that would have taken place anyway in the absence of an incentive or scheme. The higher the level of deadweight, the less the net benefits of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Given these considerations, I can confirm to the Deputy that I do not intend to extend the Help to Buy scheme to second hand properties.</p></reply>

This said, I am aware that there have been many concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, particularly in terms of forbearance and other flexible measures  being offered to them. My officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders.</p><p>I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March requesting that it press its members to provide some reliefs to their customers to alleviate the pressures brought on as a result of the current situation, and for insurers to have a common approach on how they are supporting their business customers in this difficult time.  The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on 10 April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will apply the following common measures which will be available to their business customers:</p><p><b>Forbearance</b></p><p>- Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.</p><p>- Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.</p><p><b>Business Premises</b></p><p>- Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.</p><p>- Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.</p><p>I believe that it is imperative that insurers implement these measures wholeheartedly and without causing difficulties to their customers.  The focus of my engagement to date has been with Insurance Ireland, noting that a number of its members have UK-based parent companies including one particular company who cover play centres. Despite my Department actively engaging with Insurance Ireland on that matter, the company has not signed up to this agreement.  My Department continues to engage with Insurance Ireland on this matter.</p><p>In relation to those insurers who are not members of Insurance Ireland including UK insurers, my understanding is that they are aware of this forbearance arrangement, however have made the decision not to apply it  for their own particular reasons. It should be noted that I have no influence over these companies in relation to their day to day commercial decisions, however I have asked my officials to consider how best they could engage with such companies to see if they could reconsider their position and participate in the forbearance arrangement or a similar arrangement that would assist their Irish customers.</p><p>In terms of the role of the Central Bank on this matter, the Deputy should note that the Central Bank has written to insurance firms with Irish consumers, irrespective of where the firms are prudentially regulated. The Bank requires firms to have processes in place to engage positively with customers who are experiencing difficulties in the payment of premiums because of COVID-19. The Bank also expects insurance firms to take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many customers find themselves. The Bank has also stated that, as a matter of urgency, firms should develop consumer-centric solutions to the handling of insurance payment breaks and policy rebates in light of the COVID-19 emergency.</p><p>As stated at the outset, the Central Bank has no mandate to instruct insurers to issue rebates. Additionally, the Central Bank does not have a mandate for investigating individual policyholder complaints or making determinations on the interpretation of policy wordings; these powers belong to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (where appropriate) and ultimately the courts. Nonetheless, as part of a wider programme of supervision which commenced in March, the Central Bank is continuing to engage with the larger insurance firms to ascertain their approach to dealing with specific elements of COVID-19.</p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank, Insurance Ireland and others, as appropriate, on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

A series of tax and other measures have been put in place to ameliorate particular difficulties. These measures continue to be considered as the situation evolves. I have absolute confidence that Revenue will respond appropriately to tax issues faced by taxpayers as a consequence of the COVID 19 situation and will keep taxpayers fully informed of decisions in this area.</p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT), I am advised by Revenue that the date on which CAT is payable is determined by the &lsquo;valuation date&rsquo; on which the market value of the property included in a gift or an inheritance must be established. Where this date is between 1 January and 31 August, CAT is payable by 31 October in the same year. Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, CAT is payable by 31 October in the following year.</p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date. The valuation date depends on the circumstances particular to a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all gifts and inheritances. In the case of a gift, the valuation date is generally the date on which the property is given to a beneficiary. In the case of an inheritance, however, it can be earlier as it is the date on which the executors of the will become entitled to retain the property for the benefit of a beneficiary. Generally, this is the date on which probate or administration is granted.</p>  <p>  Where the benefit consists of property, it may well be the case that CAT is payable before a beneficiary has received the property due to a delay in completing the administration of an estate. Equally, where a beneficiary has actually received the property, CAT may be payable before a beneficiary has had the opportunity to sell that property and pay the tax liability.</p>  <p>  Outside of the current COVID-19 circumstances, the length of the conveyancing process is such that it is often the case that a CAT liability arises before a property can be sold to pay that liability. To provide for such situation, taxpayers have a statutory entitlement to payment by instalments in certain circumstances.  Monthly instalment payments for up to five years may be allowed subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. In such circumstances, Revenue also has discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. </p>  <p>  Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.</p></reply>

The law affords taxpayers options on how to calculate their preliminary tax payments, including in most cases allowing the taxpayer to base the payment, either on their estimated liability for the current year, or period, or on their final tax liability for a previous year, or period.  This gives the taxpayer the flexibility to choose the option that, having regard to their own circumstances, including fluctuations in taxable income between years, gives rise to the lowest preliminary tax payment.</p><p>A self-assessed income taxpayer can base their preliminary tax payment on the lower of either </p><p>- 90% of the current year&rsquo;s liability; or</p><p>- 100% of the prior year&rsquo;s liability.</p><p>Individuals who pay their tax by direct debit have the additional option of basing their preliminary tax payment on 105% of their liability for the pre-preceding year.</p><p>A company that is a &ldquo;small company&rdquo; &ndash; broadly, a company whose corporation tax liability in the preceding accounting period did not exceed &euro;200,000 &ndash;  also has the option of basing their preliminary tax payment on either 90% of its liability for the current accounting period or 100% of its liability in the preceding accounting period. </p><p>A company that is not a &lsquo;small company&rsquo; - because its corporation tax liability in the preceding accounting period exceeded &euro;200,000 - is required to pay preliminary tax in two instalments.  The first instalment, which is due in the 6<sup>th</sup>month of the accounting period, can be based on the lower of 50% of the company&rsquo;s liability in the preceding accounting period or 45% of its liability for the current accounting period.  The second instalment of preliminary tax, which is due in the 11<sup>th</sup>month of the company&rsquo;s accounting period, must bring the company&rsquo;s preliminary tax payments up to 90% of its corporation tax liability for the current accounting period.</p><p>Therefore, those taxpayers who are experiencing difficult trading conditions because of the COVID-19 pandemic and whose income in 2020 will be significantly reduced compared to 2019, can opt to calculate their preliminary tax payment for 2020 based on their estimated liability for 2020 rather than their liability for 2019.  This will minimise the amount of preliminary tax to be paid.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that Revenue has introduced a series of  measures to assist taxpayers who are negatively impacted by the current Covid-19 pandemic.  Where a company files a Corporation<b></b>Tax Return (Form CT1) relating to an accounting period ending June 2019 onwards (and due from 23 March 2020 onwards), late because of Covid-19 circumstances, restrictions on the use of certain reliefs such as loss relief, which would normally apply where a return is filed late, will not be applied. Also, a surcharge for the late filing of Form CT1 relating to an accounting period ending June 2019 onwards is suspended until further notice.  In addition, where financial statements, which were due to be filed electronically (iXBRL accounts) in March 2020 onwards, are filed late because of COVID-19 restrictions, the application of a surcharge for the late filing is suspended until further notice.  The processing of refunds due will continue in the absence, due to the current restrictions, of the iXBRL accounts as part of the CT1.</p><p>My Department and Revenue continue to monitor developments and will respond appropriately to tax issues faced by taxpayers as a consequence of the COVID 19 situation and will keep taxpayers fully informed of decisions in this area.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the TWSS is concerned was, and is, to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for, and start to receive, payment quickly. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that is possible. Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria. </p><p>The TWSS scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020. There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed for any defined period due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work full time or part time, with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income, reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but, for Revenue operational systems reasons, the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.

The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation recently amended these regulations to extend the validity of Safe Pass cards with an expiration date after the 1<sup>st</sup>March 2020 for the duration of the Covid-19 emergency period.</p><p>The delivery of Safe Pass courses is currently suspended in accordance with public health measures. SOLAS has examined the potential for online delivery as a means of continuing national construction health and safety courses while adhering to public health measures. No immediate solution has been identified that is equitable with the existing Safe Pass course delivery model, in being accessible to all eligible workers, provides real time course participants supports (literacy and numeracy) and interpreter services, as well as ensuring assessment integrity. </p><p>The timeline for return of Safe Pass training is under consideration, informed by public health advice. Contingency plans are also being put in place to support delivery of Safe Pass training within health and social distancing guidelines once restrictions are lifted.</p></reply>

Participating learners receive a training allowance in lieu of certain social welfare entitlements. </p>  <p>  The COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was introduced as a time-limited emergency measure to meet the surge in unemployment which resulted from the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. The conditions for receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are that a person must of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have been in employment immediately prior to 13th March and have lost their employment and income due to the impact of the pandemic. This payment is not payable in addition to a jobseeker's payment.

While training allowances continue to be paid to learners until they can complete their course, additional payments that assist in the cost of actual attendance on training courses and / or work experience such as travel and meals are only paid when they are incurred.

The decisions to postpone the examinations and offer Calculated Grades were informed by health advice and by advice from an advisory committee of stakeholders, including representatives of students, teachers, parents and school managers, which I established in April 2020. The way in which the advisory group worked to examine the challenges facing the education system and to find solutions is an example of how I have been determined to involve stakeholders in building educational policy and approaches to implementation. I have also been clear with stakeholders about the exceptional nature of the challenges that Ireland and its educational system faced in 2020 because of Covid-19 and it was clearly understood among all the partners that the arrangements in place for the provision of Calculated Grades will not be regarded as a precedent or as agreement by teachers, principals or schools to implement such arrangements in future years. </p>  <p>   Work at the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on the Review of Senior Cycle has continued throughout 2020 and is nearing completion.

However, while the commentary in that report may refer to aspects of the assessment arrangements which are a feature of this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, it must also take account of the exceptional circumstances behind the arrangements that will apply this year and the understanding of the partners around their introduction. In addition, the Senior Cycle Review is intended to provide a framework for a broad range of learning and assessment arrangements, including terminal examinations, building on extensive research and evidence from Ireland and other educational systems.</p></reply>

The welfare of students and that of their families is front and centre in all decision making. My Department has worked closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the In This Together campaign which aims to help everyone in Ireland to Stay Connected, Stay Active, and look after their Mental Wellbeing throughout the Covid-19 Emergency. The In This Together campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the InThis Together site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. </p>  <p>  The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of NEPS and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. </p>  <p>  During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams was  written by NEPS and has been published by my Department.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers, students, parents. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties, and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  </p>  <p>  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.  </p></reply>

Where the number of applications from ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, tickets are allocated using an agreed selection process. </p><p>In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language.

I published detailed guidance for schools on calculated grades on 21 May. The document sets out information on the process of estimating marks for students to receive calculated grades, and this has been sent to all schools. The document, together with Frequently Asked Questions, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Further guidance and resources are being developed to support the implementation of Calculated Grades. These include an instructional video for teachers and information leaflets for schools and for parents/guardians.</p>  <p>  Teachers are asked to use their professional judgement, drawing on existing records and available evidence to arrive at an estimated mark for each student. </p>  <p>  If a student is new to a class or school, then the teacher should consult the previous teacher to obtain any relevant documentation.  My Department will be flexible in accepting estimated marks and rankings from other schools or colleges, and will look at this issue on a case-by-case basis. All reasonable efforts should be made to obtain a satisfactory evidence base. </p>  <p>  An on-line portal for students to confirm the subject level at which they initially entered for the examinations, or to change to a different level, is available since yesterday, Tuesday 26th   May.</p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate Applied students will be provided with calculated grades for subjects, tasks and vocational specialisms due to be completed in 2020. </p>  <p>  Where a student is studying one or more subjects outside of a recognised school, every effort should be made by the school to provide an estimated mark where the principal is confident that there is sufficient evidence of the student&rsquo;s achievement to make an objective judgement.</p>  <p>  For subjects with a practical component, the overall estimate will include the mark that the teacher thinks would have been achieved if it had been marked in the usual way. There is one exception to this: in the case of Home Economics &ndash; Scientific and Social, the journal component has already been marked by the SEC, and this mark will not be adjusted. </p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate that the teacher is the best placed person to examine the work of the student and give a balanced professional judgement, based on evidence, about the expected achievement of the student. Teacher professional judgement facilitates incorporating a range of available evidence as to the likely performance of students. Teachers know their students and are able to balance a variety of evidence in arriving at a professional judgement. </p></reply>

The decision to postpone the Leaving Certificate was taken following an assessment of public health advice, advice from NEPS and other information including the State Examinations Commission&rsquo;s considerations of the implications for holding the exams in July and August.  I concluded that the Leaving Certificate examinations could not be held in a reliable and valid manner, nor in a way that would be equitable for students, In July and August.</p><p>The system of calculated grades that has been put in place will allow a student to progress to the next stage of their life in a timely fashion. Students will also have the right to sit the examinations at a later stage when it is safe to hold them in the normal way. </p><p>Calculated grades are the best way of getting an accurate estimation of what a student would have achieved across all components of their examination.  Teachers are best placed to make a balanced judgement about what the candidate&rsquo;s overall performance and grade across all aspects of Leaving Certificate subjects would have been. This means the calculated grade will be as close to the outcome of the traditional Leaving Certificate as possible and comparable to the Leaving Certificate grades any other year. </p><p>A detailed document <i>A Guide to Calculated Grades for Leaving Certificate students 2020</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It explains further how the system works. Detailed guidance for teachers on the operation of the calculated grades system was published and issued to schools on 21 May.</p><p>When it was thought possible to proceed with written examinations, but not orals or music performance tests, 100% marks were awarded for the cancelled orals and performance tests.  Awarding 100% for orals and music performance tests in the calculated grade system would not be fair to students. An estimated mark for these subject components should be based on the assumption that the components would have proceeded and been marked in the normal manner. Teachers of languages will assess the student&rsquo;s oral performance as well as their written skills to come to an estimated mark for each student.</p></reply>

The record will be maintained by the principal until the conclusion of any potential review or appeal process associated with the student&rsquo;s calculated grades. The principal must notify the Department that the school has a record of contact. The Department will request written affirmation from the principal that all procedures at school level were followed despite the alleged contact before the student&rsquo;s marks and ranking can be processed. </p></reply>

My Department has written to school management and asked schools to put in place arrangements to continue the delivery of education to students.  A series of guidance notes to support schools in how to effectively support and engage with their students continues to be compiled to address challenges in providing programmes of continued learning in the current context.</p><p>School and college buildings since May 18<sup>th</sup>are available for access by teachers to facilitate the organisation and distribution of remote learning. </p><p>Specific guidance on the continuity of schooling for primary and post-primary schools issued on Thursday 2nd April. Further guidance issued on April 22<sup>nd</sup>with a particular focus on supporting students with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. These guidance documents are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The guidance is informed by feedback from school surveys and prompted by a growing demand in some schools seeking such guidance. The reaction from schools is that this material is particularly useful as they navigate the challenges associated with the new teaching and learning environment that has emerged through enforced closures of schools during the public health crises.</p><p>The nature of distant learning has required schools to take on a range of approaches to support their students. Schools and teachers have demonstrate great innovation in adapting to the new situation. Many schools are using digital resources and remote teaching as well as communicating with parents through email and digital apps to provide work for students. The Department is aware that many schools are using e-platforms to enable their teachers to provide work to students, particularly to students in examination classes, and to enable students to complete tasks and tests for assessment.</p><p>Resources to support the transition to distant learning are being provided by the Department support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), Scoilnet the Department&rsquo;s educational portal provides access to a wide variety of resources and information developed by various services including: the PDST, Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the National Council for Special Education. These resources can all be accessed at . Scoilnet also provides access to extensive educational resources including Worldbook Online, at www.scoilnet.ie</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 Enhancing Teaching Learning and Assessment, funding of &euro;210m for ICT Infrastructure will be distributed to schools over the five years of the Strategy. &euro;110m has issued over the lifetime of the strategy to date. &euro;50m is issuing now in the form of a grant payment to all eligible schools.  </p><p>In the context of the current public health crisis the funding can be focussed on assisting schools to address ICT needs to support the provision of remote learning.  This can include the purchase of ICT devices that can be shared with students who do not have access to devices, essential learning platforms and other ICT infrastructure to support the provision of remote learning. </p><p>The Department will continue to work with the education partners to provide solutions in areas where digital and remote learning options may not be possible. </p><p>In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, I expect those going into sixth year in post primary schools to be a group that will receive a particular focus in the context or preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.</p></reply>

Schools have been very innovative in meeting the challenges posed by school closures and I made this funding available at this time to assist schools to support students at risk of educational disadvantage due to COVID-19 school closures. Schools have been asked to use this funding to support students where, due to lack of access to digital devices, are disadvantaged in their engagement with the school's remote teaching and learning where this is provided by digital means.</p><p>Schools know their students and are best placed to identify how to best support their student to engage with learning during the current public health crises. The ICT Grant funding facilitates schools to put in place the supports needed to meet the needs of individual students to actively engage with remote learning. Decisions as to what equipment is to be acquired and procurement of same is the responsibility of schools. </p><p>Students, pupils and teachers can engage with remote learning using various digital devices including Desktop PCs, Laptops, Tablets and Chromebooks.  Where schools have determined that laptops are required and in order to ameliorate current laptop supply chain challenges for laptops, my Department has advised schools of two mechanisms to aggregate purchase orders for laptops from schools under centralised bulk provisioning processes. The generation of a bulk order will enable prioritisation of laptops orders with manufacturers, and so expedite delivery over and above timelines that are generally available at present. These mechanisms are established under two Single Provider Frameworks, for the provision laptops for schools, based on OGP Frameworks which meet technical and procurement requirements for schools. Information regarding OGP Frameworks for the provision of other relevant equipment for schools has also been provided via the circulars governing the ICT Grant scheme.</p><p>Full details regarding the funding are set out in Circulars 0031/2020 (&euro;40m funding) and 0032/2020 (&euro;10m funding) which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>.</p></reply>

The National Co-ordination group for tertiary education is meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their current and prospective students.</p>  <p>  In light of the current public health circumstances, it is difficult to predict the expected international student numbers for next academic year. Much depends on unfolding events such as all available national and international public health advice, particularly in respect of international travel for programmes where a physical presence in Ireland is needed. </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous with regard to management of their academic affairs including admissions procedures. The CAO processes applications for undergraduate, and some postgraduate, courses on behalf of the HEIs.  Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs which then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. This remains the case this year, including in the case of any drop in domestic or international enrolments. </p>  <p>  The projected financial impact of Covid-19 on Higher Education and the Tertiary Education system as a whole is being assessed by the Department of Education and Skills as part of its ongoing analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the education sector overall.  The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy. The Department will continue to engage with key stakeholders to safeguard the recovery of the tertiary education sector.</p></reply>

We are currently undertaking a number of actions to ensure this.</p>  <p>  Guidance has already issued to primary and post-primary schools to help ensure the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with Special Educational Needs, those in areas of educational disadvantage, and to help support the wellbeing of all learners. Guidance will issue shortly which will include information to support learners at each of the key stages of transition. </p>  <p>  This guidance has been developed in consultation with the management bodies and unions from both sectors which will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  The aim of distant learning approaches is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education. School communities have been learning to adjust and adapt to the challenges they face at this time and have taken up the challenge of staying connected with their students for teaching, learning and maintaining the social connections and supports that are so important for young people&rsquo;s wellbeing. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period.  Analysis of the gaps in learning for all their learners and how these gaps will be addressed can begin before the school term ends but in practice, it may not be possible to determine, except in broad terms, until students return to the classroom.

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. </p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;</i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. </p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.  The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.</p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. </p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child / family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. </p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.</p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  </p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.</p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.</p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children / families.  This platform will also allow the SNA to log their interactions with the family and to report on same.  SNAs can use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out this work, and access to appropriate resources and technology will also be available at the HSE / disability premises.</p><p>At all times the HSE will take account of the public health restrictions in place and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published by Government on 1 May.</p></reply>

In PISA 2018, 5,577 Irish students completed the assessment in Ireland.  In addition to the 3 the tests of reading literacy, mathematics and science, questionnaires administered in Ireland  included:</p>  <p>  - the core student questionnaire </p>  <p>  - optional short questionnaire for students on ICT </p>  <p>  The information in the report referred to by the Deputy stems from responses from both students and teachers across the OECD countries to the optional short questionnaire on ICT for students.  My Department notes and accepts the data in that context. There are no specific findings in the text accompanying the tables from the PISA survey relating to Ireland. The report concludes:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;In this moment of crisis, digital technology holds great promise to provide learners with access to high quality learning. However, most education systems need to pay close attention to ensure that technology does not amplify existing inequalities in access and quality of learning further. This is not only a matter of providing access to technology and open learning resources, but will also require maintaining effective social relationships between families, teachers and students, particularly for those students who lack the resilience, learning strategies or engagement to learn on their own. Technology can amplify the work of great teachers, but it will not replace them.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Digital Strategy for Schools outlines my Department's vision to realise the potential of digital technologies to enhance teaching, learning and assessment so that Ireland's young people become engaged thinkers, active learners, knowledge constructors and global citizens to participate fully in society and the economy. A central theme of the Strategy is Teacher Professional Development, and a Digital Learning Framework, supported by an extensive programme of CPD, is now available. This Framework will enable teachers and schools to progress in their usage of digital technologies depending on their own circumstances and to identify their particular support requirements. My Department recognises that the embedding of digital technologies can enhance teaching and learning, through appropriate supports grounded in informed pedagogical best practice.</p>  <p>  From the outset of school closure,s required under Covid-19 measures, schools and teachers were advised of the requirement to effectively engage with parents and learners to ensure continuity of teaching and learning for all their students. To enable this, extensive support material on distance learning has been made available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including the delivery of Webinars on relevant topics. My Department has published guidance for schools and teachers, to support remote learning and the continuity of teaching and learning for all students including students with special education needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage. Guidance has also been published for parents and is available on my Departments website in 12 languages. Schools are advised to ensure that in their approach to providing for the continuity of learning due consideration is given to put in place alternative arrangements where solutions involving digital technology may not be appropriate or available, to the learner. Key to this guidance is the requirement for ongoing engagement between schools, teachers, parents and learners. </p>  <p>  &euro;50m ICT grant funding has now issued to schools, and this can be used by schools to prioritise requirements arising out of the Covid-19 school closures, to support remote learning. This can include arrangements to loan school computing devices to teachers and learners who experience difficulties in accessing appropriate devices as well as putting in place appropriate learning platforms to deliver remote learning. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with stakeholders including management bodies, teacher representatives, parent and students representatives during the current period of school closures to provide supports to enable the continuation of teaching and learning.</p></reply>

A series of guidance notes to support schools to effectively support and engage with their students are published on my Department's website at: . Further guidance will continue to be compiled to address the various challenges that arise for schools in providing programmes of continued learning in the remote learning environment. Various surveys and studies has conducted across the education system has informed the development of guidance.</p><p>Schools have been asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities and to consider this actively in their responses. As part of reopening of society roadmap and the lifting of current restrictions, school and college buildings are now opened for access by teachers for the organisation and distribution of remote learning in line with public health advice and restrictions.  </p><p>Officials in my Department have liaised with colleagues in the DCCAE to raise the issue of barriers to connectivity impacting access to remote learning. Minister Bruton has announced a package of additional supports from the telecoms companies including that access to healthcare and educational resource websites identified by the Government will be zero-rated for all customers where technically feasible. The Telecommunications industry has also introduced update for data limits for consumers to assist their customers during the Covid-19 to access online services without exceeding their data limits.</p><p>The Department will continue to work with the education partners to address challenges where digital and remote learning options may not be possible. </p><p>Information as to the broadband connectivity available to individual children in their homes would not be available to the Department. In the context of the National Broadband Plan Intervention area implementation, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are addressing the needs of those areas with poor connectivity.</p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:</p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p><p>Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p><p>As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p><p>A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i></i></p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and rresources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at <i></i></p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at <i></i></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards established by QQI reflect the accreditation criteria that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. Engagement is ongoing between members of the stakeholders group, QQI and CORU to ensure that necessary arrangements are put in place to maintain standards of education and training in this area so that students graduate with the relevant professional competencies that have been set out by CORU and which are reflected in QQI&rsquo;s award standards and so that the position is clarified for students.</p></reply>

As apprentices are employees, the demand for apprenticeship is primarily met by the employer base in any area.  Each region in the country has a dedicated apprenticeship support system which is managed by the local Education and Training Board (ETB).  In this particular situation it is managed by Kilkenny and Carlow ETB.</p><p>As national programmes, apprenticeships are delivered via a range of education and training providers and it is not practical to offer the full range of apprenticeship trades in each training location.  This does not preclude employers  from any specific region from participating in these apprenticeships.  </p><p>In terms of the manufacturing sector, there are two main apprenticeships in Manufacturing Engineering and Manufacturing Technology available as well as apprenticeships in associated functions such as ICT, Sales, Accounting Technician and Logistics/Supply Chain.  A further apprenticeship in Manufacturing Data Integration Engineer is currently in development.</p><p>The 55 national apprenticeship programmes currently available are open to all eligible employers who wish to train apprentices in their particular sector, subject to suitability to train being assessed and approved by SOLAS via the local ETB. Interested employers who wish to be approved to train apprentices in a particular occupation should contact their local ETB or fill out an expression of interest form online on the apprenticeship jobs portal which is available on the website <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open addtional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an addtional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.  </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy, on individual children is not provided by the NCSE to my Department</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open addtional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an addtional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.  </p><p>No communication referred to by the Deputy has been received by my Department.</p></reply>

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. </p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;</i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. </p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.</p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. </p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child / family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. </p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.</p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  </p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.</p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.</p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children / families.  This platform will also allow the SNA to log their interactions with the family and to report on same.  SNAs can use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out this work, and access to appropriate resources and technology will also be available at the HSE / disability premises.</p><p>At all times the HSE will take account of the public health restrictions in place and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published by Government on 1 May.</p></reply>

This work will be based on the National Return to Work Safely Protocol that was published by Government and will also be informed by guidance and experience from other jurisdictions. </p><p>A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>Following consultation with the education partners, guidance will issue to schools on the logistical and curricular arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the phased re-opening of schools. This guidance will provide a framework for individual schools, including special schools, to develop plans for the re-opening of school in accordance with their own circumstances and context and the needs of their staff and students. </p><p>A range of support and guidance has been provided for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period.</p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who </p><p>teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at <i></i><b></b></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school and special school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>A special &euro;10 million fund has been made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students and students with special educational needs during this period of school closure.</p></reply>

The first of two consultation cycles focused on the purpose of senior cycle and futures thinking, with the second consultation cycle focusing on pathways and flexibility. </p>  <p>  The NCCA then commenced a public consultation which invited individuals and organisations to provide feedback on the areas for development emerging from the review to date. This phase of consultation was informed by two NCCA documents, an Interim report of review of Senior Cycle Education and accompanying Senior Cycle Review Consultation Document. The phase of consultation concluded in November 2019.</p>  <p>  Work on the Review of Senior Cycle has continued throughout 2020 and is nearing completion. The NCCA is completing an Advisory Report on the review setting out areas of work and plans to be pursued in the future development of senior cycle education. </p>  <p>  The timing for the approval and publication of the Advisory Report is currently under review in light of the impact which the emergence of COVID-19 and the measures aimed at addressing the spread of the virus have had on schools and the education system more generally. Developments during this period have highlighted aspects of senior cycle education that may warrant further consideration and additional attention within the Advisory Report. Changes on the scale envisaged this year, which have come about as a result of the exceptional circumstances prevailing as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, will be of particular interest to this work. However, it should be noted that the circumstances pertaining this year, and the arranements in place for the provision of Calculated Grades to students, are exceptional and it is understood that they will not be regarded as a precedent or as agreement by teachers, principals or schools to carry out such tasks in future years.   </p>  <p>  In this overall context, it is currently envisaged that the report will be finalised by the NCCA no earlier than Q3, 2020.  </p>  <p>  The report will then be submitted to my Department for consideration. </p></reply>

The report entitled <i>Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity</i>focuses on how emerging TUs can achieve their sectoral and national strategic objectives and the supports that are required to do so most effectively and efficiently. The TURN report sets out the case for a state change in higher education reform for the delivery of national strategic priorities such as are elaborated in Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland through the connectedness, particularly at regional level, collaboration and connectivity of TUs and their unique delivery of programmes across the full range of the National Framework of Qualifications from apprenticeships to doctoral degrees. The report , which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, makes a series of 12 recommendations that will provide a solid foundation for the development and progression of TUs in the state. </p><p>Beyond the TURN process, TU Dublin has also been of assistance in sharing its experiences upon request with other TU development consortia that are seeking to advance applications for TU designation under the TU Act 2018.</p><p>As part of the System Performance Framework 2018 &ndash; 2020 the Higher Education Authority has agreed mission-based performance compacts with higher education institutions aligned to the framework. The Authority has embarked upon the next round of strategy and performance dialogue with higher education institutions to monitor and review their performance against their compacts. All institutions, including TU Dublin, submitted a self-evaluation report of their progress towards interim targets in their compacts in Autumn 2019. The reports were reviewed by the Authority and an expert advisory panel, with feedback being provided to the institutions in early 2020. The Authority was due to meet with institutions subsequently to discuss the reports but has had to postpone the meetings for the time being as a result of the COVID19 pandemic.  </p><p>In addition to the self-evaluation reports, institutions were also invited by the Higher Education Authority to submit impact assessment case studies in Autumn 2019, aligned with national priorities and targets as set out in performance compacts and with reference to the System Performance Framework 2018-2020 and evolving national policy objectives. Case studies were reviewed by an expert advisory panel, which informed the allocation of &euro;5 million in performance funding. TU Dublin was awarded &euro;350,000 in performance funding for its impact case study &quot;<i>Establishment of Technological University Dublin</i>&quot;.</p><p>Section 23 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 requires a technological university to submit to the Minister for Education and Skills and to the Higher Education Authority an annual report on its activities in the immediately preceding year not later than 30 June in each year, having regard to its strategic development plan and equality statement and any requirements imposed under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act  2012. The Minister shall cause copies of the annual report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the TU shall arrange for the report to be published on the internet.</p><p>During its first year since establishment, TU Dublin carried out an extensive consultation process with staff, students, external partners and stakeholders which contributed to the development of the university&rsquo;s first strategic development plan entitled <i>Realising Infinite Possibilities &ndash; Strategic Intent to 2030. </i>The plan was published on 30 January 2020 and both it and the university&rsquo;s equality statement are  publicly available on TU Dublin&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services. </p><p>My Department is conscious of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education. </p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. Students are advised to submit their renewal student grant application as soon as possible. The priority closing dates for the 2020/21 academic year are the 11th June 2020 for renewal applicants and the 9th July 2020 for new applicants.</p><p>Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, <i>www.susi.ie</i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. </p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).</p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.  Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018 a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from your local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>. </p></reply>

The <i>In This Together</i>campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the <i>InThis Together</i>site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. </p><p>The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help, and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. </p><p>During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams has been developed by NEPS and published by my Department. </p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers and school communities. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties, and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to schools at this time.</p></reply>

This guidance has issued to schools to support the continuity of teaching and learning, to support those with special educational needs, to support those at risk of educational disadvantage, to support the wellbeing of students and to support students at each of the key stages of transitions. Additional guidance is being developed for primary schools to support them further in the final weeks of the 2019/2020 school year, this will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  All guidance for schools has been developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders &ndash; including teachers, parents and learners. There is also ongoing consultation with the management bodies and unions on all matters relating to Covid 19, which will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  Schools have adopted various ways to engage with their students and these will vary in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at the home. Schools are engaging with students and parents using various means such as by post, e-mails, communication apps or the school website. Where technology permits, students may have regular engagement with their teacher/s on platforms such as Google Classroom, Microsoft Office 365 and Edmodo or participate in live meetings through the use of tools such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Webex.  Schools have been asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continue to have the opportunity to participate in learning. The aim of these distant learning approaches is to ensure that children stay connected with learning to facilitate progression to the next level of their education.</p>  <p>  A group has also been established within my Department to look at the reopening of schools in the Autumn. This involves two strands: </p>  <p>  a) the logistics of reopening; health and safety; hygiene; social distancing, etc., and </p>  <p>  b) curriculum considerations, i.e., what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures</p>  <p>  The development of guidance on reopening of schools will be informed by this group and by learning from other jurisdictions that are further down the road of reopening their society, including their school systems. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to review and monitor the situation in accordance with the advice from public health authorities.</p></reply>

As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  </p><p>The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.</p><p>A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice. </p><p>In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i></i></p><p>In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i> </i></p><p><i></i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and rresources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at <i></i></p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at <i></i></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p><i></i></p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p></reply>

The change of circumstance is not applied retrospectively. Therefore, if the change occurs during the academic year, any award or adjustment will take effect from the month in which the change occurred.<b></b>This provision may benefit some students whose income has fallen in 2020 due to Covid-19 issues.</p><p>When an employment ceases, such as in cases of redundancy, there is always the possibility that the person could commence new employment shortly thereafter and there is also the possibility that the person will remain unemployed for a considerable length of time.  For this reason any applicant who is awarded a grant, or has their grant level increased, following the implementation of the change of circumstances conditions may be reviewed by SUSI later in the academic year.  </p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. Should a student wish to discuss their particular circumstances with SUSI, the Support Desk may be contacted by telephone 0761 087 874 or email: support@susi.ie</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from students&rsquo; local Tax Offices or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i></p></reply>

In the normal course of events, the majority of children with disabilities access multidisciplinary therapy services through the HSE. Many of these services have been scaled down during the Covid-19 emergency situation as staff are redeployed. The reduction in these services, combined with school closures are putting substantial demands on children with disabilities and their families. It is intended that the temporary assignment of SNAs to support children&rsquo;s disability services during this public health emergency will help to alleviate the stress being experienced by these vulnerable families. </p><p>My Department's &lsquo;<i>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs&rsquo;</i>document provides a framework for SEN Teachers and SNAs to maintain contact with SEN students and to provide appropriate learning support.  It is acknowledged and welcomed that many SNAs have been engaged in such work through their schools since the closure period began.  It has been confirmed to school management that, in the interim period pending the assignment of an individual SNA to the HSE, that SNA is available to support their allocated students through their school. </p><p>The HSE has now finalised the details of a new service which SNAs will provide during the school closure period.The HSE has started assigning SNAs to families and children identified in their services.</p><p>There has been close cooperation between the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health and the HSE in establishing and managing the scheme to date. The Departments and the HSE hold weekly meetings with the Education Division of F&oacute;rsa (the trade union representing SNAs) to resolve any issues of concern. </p><p>SNAs will be asked to provide support to those students in receipt of HSE Disability services by way of remote working through the use of telephones, smart phones or laptops. They will work under the guidance and direction of the child&rsquo;s &lsquo;key point of contact&rsquo; who will be a clinician such as a speech and language therapist, psychologist or occupational therapist who is familiar with the student and will explain what support each student and family might require. The key point of contact will provide strategies for working with the child / family and will signpost the SNA towards any resources required.  Communication channels between the school and the SNA will be facilitated where appropriate to ensure that SNAs can receive guidance where educational issues arise during the course of the suite of supports being provided by the HSE teams during this period. </p><p>SNAs will be matched with students, and wherever possible this will be their own allocated student(s). If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.</p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  </p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.</p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.</p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children / families.  This platform will also allow the SNA to log their interactions with the family and to report on same.  SNAs can use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out this work, and access to appropriate resources and technology will also be available at the HSE / disability premises.</p><p>At all times the HSE will take account of the public health restrictions in place and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published by Government on 1 May.</p></reply>

While I have not had direct engagement with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, officials from our respective Departments are in regular contact on these matters.  </p><p>My Department has established a Covid-19 Working Group for this sector which is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments including the Department of Justice and Equality and representatives of both students and English language education providers. This Group continues to meet to address measures and supports for the students and providers in this sector. </p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality continues to publish updates on any changes to the immigration permission system resulting from the Covid-19 outbreak and has recently provided a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document to provide additional detail on these measures. The most recent update, issued on 13<sup>th</sup>May 2020, informs students that all immigration permissions that are due to expire from 20<sup>th</sup>May 2020 to 20<sup>th</sup>July 2020 will be automatically renewed for a period of 2 months. It is a requirement of these permissions that students continue to be enrolled in a course of study and that they attend scheduled classes including where they are provided online. In the current circumstances and as a temporary measure, students are also permitted to work for a maximum period of 40 hours a week on the condition that they complete their course online if this service is provided by their school. Further changes to student immigration permissions will be discussed with the Department of Justice and Equality and will be informed by engagement with stakeholders for this sector, Covid-19 developments and the timeframe for the re-opening of the premises of English language education providers. </p><p>The timeframe and arrangements for the re-opening of the premises of providers and for the return to in class tuition for students will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. On May 1<sup>st</sup>, the Taoiseach announced the roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions. This roadmap sets out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.</p><p>My Department will engage with relevant stakeholders within the sector regarding their development of plans for re-opening. It is anticipated that these plans will be informed by the &quot;Return to Work Safely Protocol&quot; recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.Experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other jurisdictions will also be relevant.  </p></reply>

If this is not possible, SNAs may then be matched to support children with whom they are not familiar. Students and families requiring the greatest level of support will be prioritised.</p><p>To ensure that SNAs receive appropriate support and have regular opportunities to engage with the HSE&rsquo;s multidisciplinary teams, SNAs will be able to access resources at the relevant HSE or disability service premises and will be provided with a letter identifying them as an essential worker to facilitate travel to these centres.  </p><p>It is intended that the work of the SNAs will be underpinned by dedicated ICT supports. Therefore, where the SNA prefers to work remotely or has an underlying health condition or particular circumstances that impact on their ability to leave their home and has access to the appropriate technology this can be facilitated with the agreement of the Service Manager and key point of contact.</p><p>The HSE will provide induction for all SNAs who are asked to participate in the new service. Where possible they will ask SNAs to attend one of their offices to do this but where SNAs are self-isolating, have underlying health conditions or have childcare or other caring responsibilities, the induction can be done remotely.</p><p>The HSE are providing a dedicated IT platform which will allow the HSE to match SNAs to children / families.  This platform will also allow the SNA to log their interactions with the family and to report on same.  SNAs can use their own phone, tablet or laptop to carry out this work, and access to appropriate resources and technology will also be available at the HSE / disability premises.</p><p>At all times the HSE will take account of the public health restrictions in place and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published by Government on 1 May.</p></reply>

These matters are being examined by Government. </p>  <p>  As the law now stands, a mother is entitled to this leave irrespective of the duration of her current employment. The mother can take maternity leave from casual or part-time employment. She can take up to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave, and up to a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave. Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. As Minister of State for Justice and Equality, the legislation that governs the provision of maternity leave is my responsibility.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.   </p>  <p>  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.  </p></reply>

However, the Intoxicating Liquor (Breweries and Distilleries) Act 2018 contains statutory provisions which allow craft breweries and distilleries to obtain a producer&rsquo;s retail licence from the Revenue Commissioners which enables then to sell intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises to persons visiting the premises subject to specified conditions. </p>  <p>  Section 1(6) of the Act provides that a licence issued or renewed under the Act shall operate to authorise the sale on the premises to which the licence is attached of intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises:</p>  <p>  (a)  between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) for consumption on or off the premises, to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises, where the licence has been issued on foot of a Circuit Court certificate,</p>  <p>  (b)  between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) for consumption off the premises, to persons who have completed a guided tour of the premises, where the licence has been issued on foot of a District Court certificate, or</p>  <p>  (c)  between the hours of&mdash;</p>  <p>  (i) 10.00 a.m. and 7.00 p.m. each day (other than Christmas Day) or a day to which subparagraph (ii) applies, and</p>  <p>  (ii) 12. 30 p.m. and 7. 00 p.m. on a Sunday, other than a Christmas Day which falls on a Sunday, and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, for consumption off the premises, to persons who have not completed a guided tour of the premises, irrespective of whether the licence has been issued on foot of a Circuit Court or a District Court certificate.</p>  <p>  It can be seen, therefore, that off-sales to persons who have not completed a guided tour of the premises are permitted subject to conditions under the 2018 Act, in particular the continued availability of facilities for guided tours of the premises.</p>  <p>  This information may be of some assistance to craft brewers and distilleries throughout the country who, like many enterprises, are finding it difficult to keep their businesses going during this public health emergency.</p></reply>

I also appreciate that the current pandemic is an anxious and challenging time for many people and organisations. </p>  <p>  The position is, however, that there are statutory provisions that refer to the taking of affidavits, including section 5 of the Commissioners for Oaths Act 1889 and section 72 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994. Furthermore, rules and procedures for the taking of affidavits are set out in Order 40 Rule 5 of the Superior Courts Rules, Order 25 Rule 1 of the Circuit Court Rules and Order 50 Rule 2 of the District Court Rules.  Legislative changes would be required before changes in those procedures and rules could be brought about and only following careful consideration.</p>  <p>  The Government approved drafting of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 in January last. It contains proposals to amend a number of courts-related Acts, including proposals for electronic submission and lodgement of documents and for a statement of truth mechanism. The Bill is being drafted at present.  In addition, my Department is currently examining statutory reforms in order to respond to the new challenges and address various issues connected to the legal process arising in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  It remains the case, however, that providers of legal services, like many businesses and organisations throughout the country that need to engage directly with the public must do so in compliance with public health guidelines. The Health and Safety Authority, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Department of Health, and the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation have published extensive information on working safely during the current health emergency.  The Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation have also established a helpline to support and advise businesses in adapting to the current challenges.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate that these are difficult times for everyone and I would like to acknowledge the commitment, flexibility and innovation demonstrated by all involved in safely delivering continuity of access to justice during the current public health emergency.</p></reply>

The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions are attached.</p><p>Any permission which was renewed by the notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20 May and 20 July 2020 is now automatically renewed for a further two months. </p><p>For international English language students, this means that they will continue to be able to work if they so wish, but they must also re-enrol in an on-line course of study to adhere to the conditions of their permission. Officials from my Department have engaged with MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), the representative body for the majority of language schools in Ireland. They have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.</p><p>In relation to persons with existing permission under Directive 2004/38/EC (Free Movement Directive), the automatic renewal is subject to the requirement that the person is complying with the requirements of the Directive. </p><p>The Registration Office in Burgh Quay and all Registration Offices for non-Dublin residents operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain temporarily closed due to COVID-19. Consequently, the requirement to present at a registration office to register a new permission or renew a current permission is also temporarily suspended.</p><p>The requirement to register an immigration permission,  in person, will not arise until the Registration Office Burgh Quay (and other registration offices) re-opens or alternative arrangements are put in place.  They will only reopen when it is safe to do so, in line with Government&rsquo;s Roadmap. As the Deputy will appreciate, high-demand public offices make applying social and physical distancing more difficult. </p><p>When the Registration Office reopens, priority will be given to those seeking to register for the first time.  Those for first time registration who had appointments cancelled will have their appointments rescheduled automatically.  Other appointments will be made available exclusively for other first time applicants.</p><p>Additionally, my Department is considering alternative arrangements for renewal of registrations and priority will be given initially to those whose Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card has expired.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view our updates on the Immigration Service website at:</p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the COVID-19 impact on immigration and international protection can also be found on the website. This document is regularly updated.</p></reply>

The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. Working Holiday Authorisations are included in this notice. This extension also applies to those whose permissions have already been extended by the previous notice issued on 20 March 2020.</p><p>If normal business has not resumed by the end of that period, a further extension of permission may have to be facilitated. The Immigration Service website will be updated as necessary to reflect the latest positions - </p><p>I should inform the Deputy that Working Holiday Authorisations, work permits and registration of these categories of permission involve three different Departments:</p><p>- The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) who is responsible for the Working Holiday Authorisation (WHA) Scheme, including its administration;</p><p>- The Department of Business Enterprise and Innovations (DBEI) with responsibility for the Work Permits Scheme; and</p><p>- Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) who are responsible for registrations issued under the above WHA and Work Permits scheme. </p><p>It is a condition of the WHA scheme that a successful applicant does not seek to settle in Ireland and will leave after the authorisation period expires. Once outside the State, there is nothing to prevent the person concerned from returning and presenting himself/herself to the Immigration Officer at the port of entry in order to seek permission for the purposes of re-entering the State for a specified period. </p><p>Entry into the State is solely at the discretion of the Immigration Officer at the port of entry. The onus is on the person concerned to have all documentation relating to his/her reasons for entering Ireland for presentation to the Immigration Officer to gain entry, i.e. work, study or tourism. The Immigration Officer may grant leave to enter to a maximum period of three months. They may, depending on the documentation presented grant a lesser period that three months.</p><p>If it is the case that the person concerned wishes to return to the State in a working capacity, it is necessary for a prospective employer to obtain a work permit from DBEI on their behalf prior to taking up employment. </p><p>Any queries about changes sought to the WHA scheme, including the issue of transitioning from that scheme to the Work Permit scheme, should be directed to DFAT. The Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department will be guided by DFAT in relation to any changes it wishes to make to its scheme. </p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions. As Minister I have no direct role in these matters. I understand, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I have been informed by the Commissioner that 16 Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) are now operational across 15 Divisions.  </p><p>I am further informed that each DPSU is provided with dedicated office space for use in the provision of services that fall within its remit. Appropriate equipment, including IT equipment, has been provided for use within the DPSUs, along with one or more vehicles assigned for use by personnel attached to the relevant unit.</p><p>I understand that personnel assigned to DPSUs have been provided with a bespoke training course consisting of a number of modules addressing issues such as: investigation of sexual crime; child protection; investigation of domestic abuse; online child exploitation and sex offender management. This training course has been developed by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB), in conjunction with the Garda College.</p><p>I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to implement the roll-out of DPSUs nationwide and aims to ensure that a DPSU will be in operation within every Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division as soon as possible. Roll-out of these Units will meet a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future</i>, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>More broadly, the Deputy may be interested to know that addressing domestic abuse remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the justice sector as a whole at this time.  In recognition of the added risk of domestic abuse at this time, my Department has led development of an inter-agency plan to address domestic abuse in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  This includes the provision of additional funding to frontline services, to ensure that supports and services remain available to victims and other measures to ensure that the civil and criminal justice system can continue to give priority to domestic abuse.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to give priority to those who are at risk of domestic abuse, through a targeted operation &ldquo;Operation Faoisimh&rdquo;.  And a public awareness campaign has also been launched, in partnership with the community and voluntary sector, to publicise the support which is still available. The campaign website www.stillhere.ie includes up to date information on domestic abuse and sexual violence, as well as information on the services and supports which are available to victims.</p></reply>

In addition, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands.  This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda Divisions.</p><p>As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>I understand that as part of the overall Garda fleet, a total of 29 vehicles categorised as public order vans are deployed nationally across all Garda regions. The following table, furnished to me by the Garda authorities, sets out the detail requested by the Deputy namely the public order vans attached to each Garda Division outside the Dublin Metropolitan Region as at 18 May 2020.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Division</th>       <th>Public Order Vans</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois-Offaly Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City Division</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork North Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick Division</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total (excluding DMR)</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Finally, it may be noted that significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This includes a total of &euro;46 million specifically for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. Of this investment, a total of &euro;9 million has been made available for purchase and fit-out of additional Garda vehicles in 2020.  This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p><p>In that regard it may be of interest to the Deputy to know that, in order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of impacts of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4m. The fit-out cost of these vehicles was &euro;600,000.  I am further advised that 210 hired vehicles have been allocated nationwide at this time, at a monthly hire cost &euro;45,545, excluding fuel and other costs. </p></reply>

The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions are attached.</p><p>Any permission which was renewed by the notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20 May and 20 July 2020 is now automatically renewed for a further two months.</p><p>In relation to persons with existing permission under Directive 2004/38/EC (Free Movement Directive), the automatic renewal is subject to the requirement that the person is complying with the requirements of the Directive. </p><p>For international English language students, this means that they will continue to be able to work if they so wish, but they must also re-enrol in an on-line course of study to adhere to the conditions of their permission. Officials from my Department have engaged with MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), the representative body for the majority of language schools in Ireland. They have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.</p><p>My Department has been engaging with the NGO sector on the issue of undocumented migrants. It is important to emphasise, that when it comes to people living here illegally, the only option for regularisation is on a case-by-case basis.  Ireland along with other Member States of the EU, has committed, under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (2008), to a case-by-case approach as opposed to mass regularisation. </p><p>In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact the Department or their local immigration office when they reopen to take all appropriate steps to regularise their own and their family's status. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, high-demand public offices make applying social and physical distancing more difficult, and in recognition of these difficulties, the Registration Office in Burgh Quay and all Registration Offices for non-Dublin residents operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain temporarily closed due to COVID-19. </p><p>Therefore the requirement to present at a registration office to register a new permission or renew a current permission is also temporarily suspended. The requirement to register an immigration permission,  in person, will not arise until the Registration Office Burgh Quay (and other registration offices) re-opens or alternative arrangements are put in place.  </p><p>When the Registration Office reopens, priority will be given to those seeking to register for the first time.  Those for first time registration who had appointments cancelled will have their appointments rescheduled automatically.  Other appointments will be made available exclusively for other first time applicants.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view our updates on the Immigration Service website at:</p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the COVID-19 impact on immigration and international protection can also be found on the website. This document is regularly updated and is available here:  </p><p>. </p></reply>

Part 3 is the core of the personal insolvency legislation, dealing with the operation in practice of the three personal insolvency mechanisms &ndash; Debt Relief Notices, Debt Settlement Arrangements, and Personal Insolvency Arrangements. </p>  <p>  In practice, the insolvency legislation has already been extensively reviewed and developed since 2012. Key reforms introduced include the section 115A court review process (which removed the so-called &lsquo;bank veto&rsquo;) enacted in 2015, interlocking reforms to bankruptcy also enacted in 2015, and the establishment in 2016, and extension in 2019, of the Abhaile Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (which in effect ensures that borrowers at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears can access free independent expert financial and legal advice to get solutions into place, and can access legal aid to support a section 115A court review application or appeal).  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have always said that we will keep this important legislation under review, and will take any further action needed to ensure that it operates effectively.   </p>  <p>  In the course of the public consultation, a range of detailed submissions was received. These have been carefully analysed, and a number of follow-up discussions have been held with the stakeholders concerned.   </p>  <p>  The submission from the Insolvency Service of Ireland highlighted a number of points where it believes legislative amendments would be beneficial. Given the ISI&rsquo;s statutory role in monitoring the operation of the personal insolvency system and advising me on matters related to their functions, their suggestions are particularly important for the review. Subsequent discussions with the ISI have highlighted additional possible changes to the Personal Insolvency Acts. </p>  <p>  The ISI&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, which brings together a variety of stakeholders involved in personal insolvency, made a separate submission to the review, which indicated a strong level of consensus between representatives of debtors and creditors in support of specified measures to streamline the personal insolvency process. </p>  <p>  Submissions received also suggested measures to extend access to personal insolvency options to a wider cohort of borrowers, and to encourage more constructive engagement with the legislation by both creditors and debtors, with a view to supporting and accelerating the agreement of sustainable statutory personal insolvency options. </p>  <p>  All of these proposals are being considered as part of the review.  </p>  <p>  Following the closing date for submissions, some additional issues emerged, and the timeframe for the review was extended to allow these to be taken into account. Most of these have since been resolved by a series of important court judgments under the Personal Insolvency Acts. A small number of remaining points are likely to be the subject of recommendations by the review. </p>  <p>  The finalisation of the review, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Finance, has been delayed by other urgent legislative priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains an active priority for completion. As the Deputy is aware from my replies to his recent questions (D&aacute;il Question No. 486 of 20 May 2020 and Covid-19 PQ 5.709 of 5 May 2020), those priorities include consideration of certain specific formal or procedural statutory requirements which may be difficult or impracticable to comply with, due to COVID-19 restrictions, including a small number of requirements under the Personal Insolvency Acts, so that any necessary amendments could be addressed in an urgent forthcoming Bill. </p>  <p>  I expect the review report to be finalised by September, following further consultations with the Department of Finance, as required by s. 141 of the Acts, and with the  Office of the Attorney General. That timetable, as the Deputy will appreciate, is of course subject to the legislative priorities that will be decided in the new Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The Community Return Scheme was introduced in 2011 as a means of ensuring that where appropriate, prisoners released on Temporary Release engaged in structured activities within their communities, under the supervision of the Probation Service. Prisoners released on the Community Return Scheme contribute to their local communities by engaging in activities such as working in charity shops, maintenance of public areas, sports facilities etc. I am informed by my officials in the Irish Prison Service that all prisoners considered for early release under the Scheme are subject to a rigorous assessment process with the primary consideration being that of public safety.</p>  <p>  The Programme has been a positive development since its inception. As well as allowing prisoners to complete their sentence by way of performing a service to the community, it has significantly helped these prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities. </p>  <p>  The Scheme was evaluated in 2014 with that evaluation pointing to very high levels of compliance among prisoners at a rate of 89%.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme was further reviewed in 2019 and, acting upon the advice of my officials in both the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service, I broadened the eligibility criteria for the Scheme with a view to identifying further numbers of prisoners who could be released safely into the community in response to capacity issues across the prisons estate arising from rising prisoner numbers. The change in criteria was also linked to increasing the cohort of prisoners who could avail of the rehabilitative effects of participation in the scheme.</p>  <p>  Those changes to the eligibility criteria were introduced in August 2019. I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that it has recently emerged that a misinterpretation of the eligibility criteria resulted in a very small number of prisoners (three) having their cases assessed for eligibility under the old criteria. However, I am further advised that those cases have since been referred for assessment for suitability for release under the Scheme, and that their applications are currently under active consideration.</p></reply>

Further upgrade works are progressing and involve the provision of new cells and custody management facilities.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has decided that rather than construct an entirely new building, as was originally intended under the PPP model, the upgrading of the existing station to a high standard will continue. I have been assured that the upgrades will ensure that accommodation needs are addressed and that the station is upgraded to meet the future operational requirements of Garda members, staff and the public who use it. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources.  Further and as the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.</p>  <p>  The overall priority of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p></reply>

That has always been our priority. </p>  <p>  I do appreciate that the circumstances in which the Skellig Accommodation Centre was opened did not allow for full engagement with local representatives, communities and services; to inform and reassure them and to answer their questions. That is certainly something that I, Minister Flanagan and our officials regret. But, during a public health emergency the decision to move people to a dedicated accommodation centre was seen as an appropriate positive response.  </p>  <p>  All centres are following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at its website www.hpsc.ie.  That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic. My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so. </p>  <p>  At the very outset of the crisis, my Department discussed with the HSE the fact that we were accommodating some people in commercial hotels that the Department did not have exclusive use of. This was seen as higher risk at that time in the early stages of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  For that reason, we needed to move people to dedicated accommodation centres where they could receive the full set of State supports and services. To do this, we needed to open more accommodation. The Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen had been offered to us and was available for immediate occupancy. </p>  <p>  We also opened new centres in Rosslare Harbour and Tullamore and temporary accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. </p>  <p>  In total, 600 people were relocated to support social and physical distancing including just over 100 people to the new centre in Cahersiveen. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of the residents arrived in Cahersiveen on March 18 and 19.   Some of them did come from a hotel in Dublin at which a case of COVID-19 was subsequently confirmed in an unrelated guest.  My Department was not told of that confirmed case until it was brought to Minister Flanagan&rsquo;s attention by Deputy Catherine Murphy on 6 April 2020. </p>  <p>  From subsequent discussions with management at the hotel, our understanding is that the guest involved had only stayed at the hotel for one night in early March when they fell ill. The guest was removed to hospital and their close contacts were asked by the HSE to self-isolate for 14 days as is the norm. No one that we were accommodating in the hotel was approached as a traced contact, and there was no indication whatsoever that anyone we relocated from that hotel was in any way unwell, was awaiting a test or a test result.  In fact, it was well over a fortnight after they arrived before any of our residents in Cahersiveen were confirmed as positive for COVID 19. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same are matters for the HSE in a public health context. We can confirm that, in line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone who has tested positive has been moved to a dedicated self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. Everyone else in the centre was asked to self-isolate while the HSE continued to monitor the situation. Thankfully, the HSE has confirmed that that period of self-isolation ended on 20 May 2020 and all residents are now subject to the same restrictions as anyone else under Phase 1 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.   </p>  <p>  There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time. </p>  <p>  Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There has been a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Now that the outbreak has been declared over, he will remain at the centre until the end of May to support residents. Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use. </p>  <p>  The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends. </p>  <p>  The current restrictions are especially difficult for children. In addition to the upgrades to the outdoor space, toys, puzzles and tablets have been being provided for children and laptops have also been provided for residents&rsquo; use. The Tusla official seconded to work with my Department has contacted the families to see what additional supports they need and to discuss any concerns they might have. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have held virtual clinics with residents and a telephone support service for residents across all centres, run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), was launched on 20 May. </p>  <p>  The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work with accommodation centre management, health agencies and NGOs to provide every support possible to residents at this unprecedented and difficult time for all. </p></reply>

It reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to create an equal, fair and inclusive society for all, to target discrimination and to enable LGBTI+ people to overcome the barriers they face. </p>  <p>  The development of this Strategy was underpinned by a robust consultation process from October 2018 until February 2019 including a series of regional and thematically focused workshops. Specific workshop sessions were organised for international protection applicants, migrants and refugees.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Strategy recognises the vulnerability of LGBTI+ people within the International Protection process and commits to measures to ensure they are treated sensitively and provided with appropriate supports over the course of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  These measures include the introduction of new National Standards for our accommodation centres.  The National Standards, published last August last year, were developed with UNHCR Ireland and members of the NGO community. The Standards are being implemented in new centres that are being contracted at present. </p>  <p>  One of the Standards, which will benefit members of the LGBTI+ community in our accommodation centres, will be the need for continuous training to improve the service for all living in the centre, and confidential information provision through leaflets and posters in order to promote dignity. </p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy of some current measures in place in our centres.</p>  <p>  A Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment is implemented in our accommodation centres, which includes safeguarding residents from harassment or violence based on their sexual orientation. </p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department  (IPAS ) have staff present at the International Protection Office when a person first applies for International Protection. Should an applicant require accommodation or other services, IPAS determines the most suitable accommodation based on the needs of each individual or family group.  Where a person discloses their self-determined identity to IPAS, they are, in so far as is possible and practicable, assigned accommodation based on their needs. This determination may include the provision of shared accommodation with a partner who is also seeking accommodation or being accommodated within the Direct Provision system.  This would, of course, only apply where this information is disclosed.  </p>  <p>  At any time during their stay in an accommodation centre, a resident has the option to request a transfer to a more suitable centre.  The policy of the IPAS is to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of all residents. Staff working in accommodation centres receive regular training to equip them with the skills to support all residents.  </p>  <p>  The IPAS liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support.  In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a monthly peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process.  Is Rainbow Muid continues to be active and provide vital supports to LGBTI+ people living in our accommodation centres at this time.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that IPAS together with the Inclusion, Equality and Gender Equality Unit of my Department are in the process of developing a broad LGBTI+ policy, which will include a transgender accommodation policy to promote equality, take account of people's self-determined identity and ensure that the safety and wellbeing of all residents is also promoted. It had been hoped that the LGBTI+ policy for IPAS would be finalised by the end of the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the Covid-19 crisis. However, important contacts have been made between IPAS and support agencies in the LGBTI community and a meeting between LGBT Ireland and IPAS took place at the beginning of March 2020. Further meetings with TENI and BelongTo will be arranged  as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I am further informed that as at 30 April 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 8 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Wexford Divisional Drugs Unit. </p><p>I understand that overall, there are now 278 Garda personnel in Divisional Drugs Units as of 30 April 2020, assigned to tackle drug related crime on a local basis throughout the country supported, as needed, by the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau which has 89 Garda&iacute; attached to it as of 30 April 2020.</p><p>More generally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. There are now over 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow. Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Arrest remains a last resort.  </p><p>The third report of the Policing Authority, dated 20 May, indicates that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuing to act in a sensitive and proportionate manner and to use the powers provided for under the Health Regulations only sparingly.

While delays are expected, ISD is endeavouring to keep operating to the best of its ability.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view our updates and a detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the Immigration Service website at:</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the parliamentary questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Moreover, I understand that the list provided is very likely to contain the names of Commissioners for Oaths who have passed away.  In providing the Deputy with this information, therefore, I would be anxious that the information be handled sensitively and that it would not be a source of upset to family members of a Commissioner of Oaths (or indeed a Peace Commissioner) within the lists who have since passed away.  Due to the nature of the Commissioner of Oaths records , some of which are paper based and contained in ledger books while more recently moving to the electronic recording of this information, the Courts Service have advised that there is a small margin of error when creating a list to cover a full county area spanning many decades as this one does.  </p><p><b>Commissioners for Oaths in Meath</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Names</th>       <th>Names</th>       <th>Names</th>       <th>Names</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mary Farnan</td>       <td>Michael Cooney</td>       <td>Annette Kelly</td>       <td>Vincent O&rsquo;Reilly</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rachel Ginnity </td>       <td>Frank Dunne</td>       <td>Louis Noonan</td>       <td>Thomas Kelly</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Norbert Smith</td>       <td>Michael Weldon</td>       <td>Thomas Noonan</td>       <td>Dermot Morris</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Seamus Murphy</td>       <td>James Carolan</td>       <td>Edward Rogers</td>       <td>Thomas Daniel</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PJ McKenna</td>       <td>Mary Connell</td>       <td>William F.

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. There are now over 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.  Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant increase in operational policing hours nationwide.</p><p>Specifically in relation to Meath Division, I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of the end of April 2020, a total of 346 Garda members were assigned to the Meath Division, in addition to 41 Garda staff.  This represents a significant increase in recent years: I understand that by contrast, in December 2015 there were a total of 277 Garda members and 26 Garda staff in the Division.  </p><p>I am further informed that, as at 30 April 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Roads Policing Units stands at 739 Garda members.  Of this, I understand that 18 Garda&iacute; and 2 Sergeants were specifically assigned to Meath Roads Policing Unit as on the same date.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to be aware that a detailed breakdown of Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, in the interests of transparency and for the convenience of Deputies and the wider public.

Key reforms introduced include the section 115A court review process (which removed the so-called &lsquo;bank veto&rsquo;) enacted in 2015, interlocking reforms to bankruptcy also enacted in 2015, and the establishment in 2016, and extension in 2019, of the Abhaile Mortgage Resolution Service in effect ensures that borrowers at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears can access free independent expert financial and legal advice and in certain cases legal aid.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have always said that we will keep this important legislation under review, and will take any further action needed to ensure that it operates effectively. My Department is currently engaged in preparatory work for two sets of legislative changes to the legislation.</p>  <p>  Firstly, my officials are considering certain specific formal or procedural statutory requirements which may be difficult or impracticable to comply with due to COVID-19 restrictions, including a small number of requirements under the Personal Insolvency Acts. Subject to Government formation and to reconstitution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the intention is to bring forward for Government approval, a short urgent Bill, in order to make any necessary amendments as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Secondly, my officials are already working to complete the major statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts, following the earlier public consultation already held, and now, in addition, to ensure that this review will also take full account of the latest developments and particularly, the significant economic effects of the Covid-19 outbreak. </p>  <p>  I expect the review report to be finalised by September, following further consultations with the Department of Finance, as required by s. 141 of the Acts, and with the Office of the Attorney General. That timetable, as the Deputy will appreciate, is of course subject to the legislative priorities that will be decided in the new Programme for Government.</p></reply>

I understand that, as of 26 May 2020, there has been no positive prisoner case of Covid-19 within the Irish prison service. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.  In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the classification of prisoners as a vulnerable group by the NPHET means that the Irish Prison Service must exercise an abundance of caution in relation to the unwinding of the measures which are currently in place to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading in our prisons. </p>  <p>  I am assured by the Irish Prison Service that its Emergency Response Planning Team is continually updating contingency plans in relation to Covid-19.  I am further informed that these contingency plans are, by their nature, highly operational and are subject to change given the multiple scenarios that are possible.  I am assured that the Irish Prison Service will publicise changes and plans in a timely manner, as the situation develops. </p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on risk assessments, I am informed that, in the context of declining rates of infection in the community, the Irish Prison Service is currently carrying out a risk assessment to determine when and how the restrictions put in place in recent months may be eased, while also ensuring that it maintains control of the risk of the spread of infection and ensures good order and security in the prisons.</p>  <p>  I understand that the risk assessment currently being undertaken includes the following elements:</p>  <p>  - Reviewing the physical access in-reach services provided to the prisons, including psychology, education, chaplaincy and addiction counsellors. In terms of current arrangements it may be noted that to mitigate against the impact of these services not being available in a traditional manner, I understand the Prison Service has put in place a dedicated phone service for prisoners to reach out to chaplains, psychologists and addiction counsellors and that it has increased the use of technology to ensure these essential services continue.  </p>  <p>  - Reviewing at what stage and how physical visits with families may resume, while maintaining controls at point-of-entry to screen for the infection; maintaining social distancing in the waiting rooms and during visits.  Pending any change and as the Deputy may be aware, additional phone calls have been provided to prisoners and a facility for family video-link calls has also been put in place.</p>  <p>  - Reviewing the regime management plans in place, which restrict the movement of prisoners around the prison and impacts out-of-cell and yard time. Again it should be noted that to mitigate against the negative impact of the more restricted regimes in place during the current Covid-19 pandemic, I am informed that the Prison Service has ensured that gym facilities for prisoners remain opened, albeit on a reduced schedule and has taken a range of other measures including for example installation of additional TV channels for prisoners in their cells and issuance of a weekly newsletter to prisoners providing information on what the Irish Prison Service is doing and why. </p>  <p>  - I am also informed that the Prison Service is working with the HSE to put in place a process that will facilitate the testing of all new committals to the prisons at an early stage, which will allow for the prisoner to exit quarantine and enter the general population at an earlier stage, provided test results are negative. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the Irish Prison Service has assured me that it is at all times cognisant of the impact of its decisions on people in custody. This impact is taken into account at all times, including at every stage of the planning process and the implementing of actions necessary to control and mitigate against the risk of Covid-19 in the prison environment. </p></reply>

I have previously set out the wide range of measures adopted by the Irish Prison Service, to address the risk presented by Covid-19 in a prison environment.   </p>  <p>  Guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and guidance of the Council of Europe, measures introduced have included:</p>  <p>  - The introduction of a basic health check, including taking of temperatures for all persons, including staff, entering prisons from 29 March;</p>  <p>  - Suspension of physical family visits, replaced by the introduction of video visits; </p>  <p>  - Quarantining for 14 days of all newly committed prisoners, in order to reduce the risk that a new committal who might be incubating the virus could spread Covid-19 to the general prison population;</p>  <p>  - Isolation of suspected case or prisoner with symptoms to prevent the risk of transmission of infection;</p>  <p>  - &ldquo;cocooning&rdquo; of vulnerable prisoners, including all prisoners aged 70 years or more or those who are deemed medically vulnerable;</p>  <p>  - comprehensive training for IPS staff and the provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across the prison estate; </p>  <p>  - strong communication with staff and prisoners, including two prison newsletters published weekly and regular Covid-19 information leaflets for prisoners and newsletters for staff regarding actions taken; and</p>  <p>  - establishment of a robust contract tracing model which has been acknowledged by the World Health Organization as best practice.</p>  <p>  In addition and as the Deputy is aware, in March of this year, I approved actions to assist the Irish Prison Service in reducing the numbers of prisoners in custody.  </p>  <p>  In that context, the Irish Prison Service has been implementing measures to reduce the prison population, in order to ensure good infection control and to ensure that cells are available for the accommodation of any prisoner who may be required to isolate in accordance with guidance from the public health authorities.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, the approach adopted included granting temporary release to low risk prisoners who were serving sentences of less than 12 months for non-violent offences. Subsequently, prisoners assessed as low risk who had less than 6 months to serve were also granted temporary release from some prisons.</p>  <p>  I am informed that all prisoners granted temporary release were assessed on a case-by-case basis, utilising the existing criteria for temporary release. The primary factor in the consideration of any prisoner for early release remains public safety. Risks assessed included any convictions for domestic abuse, such as breach of barring orders which present significant risks at the present time. I am informed that other criteria taken into account include the nature and gravity of the offence, length of sentence served to date, prior record on temporary release, behaviour while in custody and previous criminal history.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the size of the prison population changes on a daily basis, as new committals and remands are made by the courts and releases occur as prisoners reach the end of their sentences. However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the prison population has reduced from a total of 4,214 on 12 March 2020 to a total of 3,755 on 26 May 2020.  This represents a reduction of 459 or approximately 11% over the period. The range of measures introduced has therefore meant that the occupancy in many prisons has been reduced in order to support infection control and isolation measures as much as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, prisoners are considered a particularly vulnerable group and an outbreak of Covid-19 would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread among other inmates and prison staff.  However the strategy employed by the Irish Prison Service to control the risks arising during this pandemic has to date been successful, thanks to the detailed planning carried out and the cooperation and understanding of all concerned, including both staff and prisoners.  I understand that, as of 26 May 2020, there has been no positive prisoner case of Covid-19 within the Irish prison service. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.  In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, NPHET and the HSE.</p></reply>

The measures adopted have been guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and guidance of the Council of Europe.</p><p>I understand that the Irish Prison Service is acutely aware of the supportive role that families and friends play in prisoners&rsquo; efforts to rehabilitate themselves while in prison and in their preparation for life in the community after release from prison.  I am advised that every effort was made to continue to facilitate physical family visits for as long as it was safe to do so and that physical visits were only ceased following the Government announcement in March, preventing all non-essential travel.</p><p>As I have previously set out, in recognition of the impact of visitor restrictions on prisoners, the Irish Prison Service introduced a number of initiatives to allow families to continue to communicate and support those in custody including through:</p><p>- The provision of additional phone calls for prisoners;</p><p>- The introduction of virtual visits, through the installation of video phone facilities in all prisons to allow for video-calls with families; and</p><p>- The introduction of Electronic Funds Transfer and An Post Bill Pay service to allow families to continue to lodge money to prisoner accounts.</p><p>I understand that the introduction of the new video visits system has allowed prisoners to continue to maintain important communication with their families. I am informed that to date feedback from prisoners and families that have used the system successfully has been very positive. I am also informed that, as with any new system and process, and especially one that is implemented within a very short time frame, there have been a number of challenges and technical issues with some calls but that the Prison Service continues to work on any issues to solve them.  I understand that there have been particular difficulties in recent days, following a video phone software update which resulted in system crashes on a number of occasions in the past week. Resolution of this IT difficulty required temporary suspension of visits for a short time, but I understand that the system has now been restored.  It is also the case that some issues may arise due to factors outside the control of the Irish Prison Service, which may include for example poor broadband coverage impacting connectivity for some visitors.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that useful &ldquo;how to&rdquo; guides are published on the Irish Prison Service website at for the information of people using the remote visit facilities.  In addition, I understand that the Irish Prison Service has set up a dedicated helpline for the families of prisoners who may experience difficulty in connecting to a scheduled video call.</p><p>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that where a scheduled video-call does not take place due to a technical problem, every effort is made to ensure that the prisoner is provided with the opportunity to have a normal phone call with their family member instead. </p><p>I am further informed that all new initiatives introduced have been risk assessed, to ensure there are measures in place to prevent the virus from spreading through prisoners sharing handsets or other equipment, and to ensure the maintenance of good order and security. </p><p>In the absence of direct contact from people in the outside community, I understand that the Irish Prison Service is at the same time taking steps to maintain good communication with prisoners and staff; and to allow prisoners to maintain human contact during these difficult times. I am informed that the Irish Prison Service has set up a dedicated team to co-ordinate the communication of information about the pandemic and its impact to prisoners. </p><p>I understand that two prisoner newsletters are published weekly, on a collaborative basis between the IPS, the Education and Training Board and the Irish Red Cross. Tailored regular communications with regular Covid-19 information leaflets for prisoners (developed by the prison Red Cross Prisoner Volunteers) and Covid-19 information newsletters for staff are being distributed to raise awareness of the particular risks the virus poses in a prison environment and to provide accessible updates on the necessary actions being taken. There is also a special newsletter for prisoners who are in quarantine or cocooning with tailored messaging for them. Prisoners who are in quarantine or cocooning can use the prisoner phone system to access prisoner services from Psychology, Chaplaincy, resettlement or Merchants Quay. </p><p>I understand that this system is being reviewed to ensure that it meets requirements and to assess if the service can be improved further.  Further and in general, I understand that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines.  In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  </p></reply>

This is due to the different data collection methods used by both Departments and that one Public Health Passenger Locator form may be used by family units/groups who intend to self-isolate together.</p><p>The Passenger arrivals data for airports from 1 May 2020 to 22 May 2020 are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Airport</th>       <th>Passenger Arrivals</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>11,671</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>657</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shannon</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>62</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>12,453</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The precise total passenger arrivals into Irish Sea Ports are not available at this time.

These are total passenger numbers on the Central, Southern and Continental routes. These figures are outlined below and represent combined arrival and departure numbers. On average, there tends to be an even divide between arrival and departure numbers but a precise breakdown will be available from the Central Statistics Office in the coming weeks.</p><p>For the information of the Deputy, an explanation of the route corridors is as follows:</p><p>- Central corridor (sailings from Dublin to Heysham, Liverpool and Holyhead)</p><p>- Southern Corridor (sailings from Rosslare to Pembroke and Fishguard)</p><p>- Continental Corridor (sailings from Ireland to the European Continent)</p><p>For the duration of the crisis the CSO will be publishing monthly Air and Sea Travel Statistics . The March figures were released on 13 May 2020. This release will publish the total number of persons arriving in Ireland from overseas and departing Ireland for overseas destinations.

They were subsequently received by the Dublin Visa office on 20 January 2020, for further processing, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification. </p><p>The Policy Document contains a stated business target that visa applications to join non-EEA national family members should be dealt with within twelve months of receipt of application.  However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification. </p><p>It is not possible to give a definitive date as to when these applications will be finalised. All applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt. While every effort is made to process applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume and complexity of applications, the possible need for the Visa Office to investigate, inquire into, or seek further information, and the resources available.  </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the way the Immigration Services (ISD) of the Department conduct its business.  In line with advice issued by Government, HSE and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), ISD has implemented a suite of measures to help in reducing the spread of the virus. These measures include the closure of our offices in Burgh Quay and the implementation of remote working for Immigration Services staff in order to comply with social and physical distancing measures. Unfortunately, these measures have led to a reduction in processing capacity. While delays are expected including in the processing of family reunification visa applications, ISD is endeavouring to keep operating to the best of its ability.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view the updates and the detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the Immigration Service website at:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act, other than sections 3, 4 and 7 in Part 1 and sections 96 and 102 and Chapter 3 in Part 9, into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The provisions commenced in Part 8 were the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in section 82; the definitions of &ldquo;code of practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;working group&rdquo; in section 91(1); and section 91(2).  The commenced provisions provided for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the DSS in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018).    </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Act which relates to Enduring Powers of Attorney has not yet been commenced. At present, enduring powers of attorney are created under the Powers of Attorney Act 1996. When Part 7 of the Act is fully commenced, new enduring powers of attorney will be created under the 2015 Act and registered by the Director of the DSS.  The implementation of the Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the registration of enduring powers of attorney when the Act is fully commenced.   A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining uncommenced provisions of the Act (including Part 7) however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational. The DSS, led by its Director, is working tirelessly to put in place the necessary infra-structure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS.  These key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. The Department is committed to seek further funding through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021 but this will of course be subject to available exchequer funding through that process. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, the Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including for example the Courts Service and the HSE, Departments of Health and Justice and Equality, amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group comprised of all of these stakeholders is meeting regularly to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of this project.</p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  The occupations lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process and involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and in the current context COVID 19. The views and guidance of the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy, chaired by this Department, are also an important part of the decision-making process. </p>  <p>  Currently the occupation of social worker is ineligible for an employment permit. In order to have an occupation considered for amendment on the Occupations Lists, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  A detailed evidence-based case based on this data needs to be put forward to the lead policy Government Department for their observations, in this instance the Department of Health, and then submitted to this Department for review and consideration. </p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services. Similar to many other public bodies, the Covid-19 pandemic has presented a challenge to the WRC in relation to the delivery of its core services. </p><p>The WRC publishes regular information updates on its website in relation to its service provision which includes receiving and processing matters pertaining to individual and collective issues. In relation to complaints to the Adjudication Service, where a complaint is submitted electronically, the date of receipt is recorded automatically which enables an Adjudication Officer to note the receipt date in terms of any consideration of statutory timeframes. In instances where hard copy correspondence is lodged, the WRC has in place arrangements for such correspondence to be processed by certain staff who attend the office to date stamp, scan and process it. </p><p>Following a recent public consultation process, the WRC has announced how it proposes to process such complaints during the current pandemic.

It is a particularly difficult time for retailers who have had to close their doors in the interest of public health and adherence to the public health guidelines. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published on Friday 1st May sets out five stages for modifying the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals. The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>Large supermarkets have been able to remain open under the measures published on the 27th March which included the updated list of essential retail outlets . On 15 May, 2020 the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business from Monday May 18, 2020. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of essential retail outlets and other facilities that can therefore reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website  </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen. </p><p>Under the risk based approach deployed in the Roadmap, under Phase 2 (from June 8th) small retail outlets can reopen with a small number of staff on the basis that the retailer can control the number of individuals that staff and customers interact with at any one time. These measures will only come into place when the National Public Health Emergency Team says that the conditions are right for more relaxation of the restrictions in place to protect us all.</p><p>As Chairperson of the Retail Consultation Forum I have previously communicated with the major grocery multiples that where retail outlets and stores have discrete drapery and clothing sections or floors, these should close in line with the Government&rsquo;s announcements on non-essential retail. I understand some essential retailers such as large supermarkets may carry products which are incidental to their primary retail function. </p><p>The advice for individuals is still to stay at home as much as possible. During Phase 1, it is intended that customers should restrict visits to such stores for essential supplies. All retailers are encouraged to continue to provide on-line services where that is possible and appropriate to minimise footfall. All of these retail outlets must implement physical distancing measures and measures set out in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.

The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premises but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been.</p><p>Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.

The inspector grades are comprised of Grade I (senior inspectors) as well as Grade II and Grade III inspectors. The Health and Safety Authority has 109 inspectors (104.5 whole-time equivalents) in the grade. It is important to note that not all of these inspectors are involved in field inspection duties. Inspectors operate across a large mandate including occupational health and safety, market surveillance of products and chemicals. The HSA has 67 field inspectors who have been assigned to inspect on foot of the Return to Work Safely Protocol. </p><p>Inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority operate on a regional basis as follows: </p><p>Dublin South City &amp;amp; County, Kildare and Wicklow; North Western Unit - Galway, Mayo, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo; Dublin North City &amp;amp; County, Louth, Meath; South West Unit - Clare, Limerick, Cork City &amp;amp; County, and Kerry; Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, Tipperary, Carlow, Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has regional offices in Waterford, Athlone, Limerick, Cork, Kilkenny, Galway and Sligo with its head office in Dublin. </p><p>While the Authority is overseeing compliance with the Protocol, it has been recognised that given the nature of COVID-19, a cross Government inspection and compliance approach is required. To this end, a range of other inspection bodies will be mobilised by Government to also inspect and check compliance with the Protocol. The numbers of additional resources working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system. These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities. Compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of their normal inspection regime. It will start shortly with around 200 officers from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, such as WRC inspectors, in line with the Government Roadmap. </p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given his commitment that agriculture inspectors working within his Department will work with the Health and Safety Authority on ensuring the implementation of the Protocol in workplaces.</p></reply>

I am conscious that, for practical reasons, the impact on some businesses has been particularly severe. On Wednesday, 20 May I had a meeting via conference call with representatives of the hair and beauty and barber industry to discuss the implications of Covid-19 for their businesses.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to queries around cashflow and working capital, the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March and currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. </p>  <p>  Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.</p>  <p>  Funding under this scheme is offered at favourable terms and at a lower interest rate than other similar SME lending available in the market. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).</p>  <p>  There are significant advantages to operating these loan guarantee schemes through participating financial providers. This allows the Government to leverage existing commercial lending infrastructure to provide an efficient mechanism for making competitive lending products available to Covid-19-impacted businesses. The guarantee structure ensures that eligible applicants to the schemes represents a reduced risk to the participating lender, which in turn ensures access to appropriate financing for more businesses. </p>  <p>  However, the operation of these loan schemes through the financial providers also means that interest is a feature of the loans, as some interest must be charged by the lenders to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government.</p>  <p>  For micro-enterprises (businesses with fewer than 10 employees), the Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), has been introduced as a support to help businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis to access funding. </p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six-month interest-free and repayment-free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans sought directly through MFI.</p>  <p>  In terms of new supports, on 2 May, I announced a &euro;2billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years. Loans under the scheme will be offered at below market interest rates, and the scheme will support a variety of credit facilities.</p>  <p>  A number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted were also outlined on 2 May. These included:</p>  <p>  - A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt;</p>  <p>  - A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue to provide full services to the public.</p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen. This fund will provide up to &euro;10,000 to micro and small businesses and will be implemented either through a rebate or waiver scheme based on rates payment for 2019, and will be targeted more widely at micro and small enterprises that have suffered large falls in revenue as a result of the crisis. These recently announced supports will help businesses affected by Covid-19 to address a range of credit needs. </p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18<sup>th</sup>. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. <i></i></p><p>The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premises but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been.</p><p>Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.  If there are queries that are not addressed on the application form, businesses can contact the Business Support Unit in each local authority.</p><p>All information including the application form is available on the appropriate local authority website, the details of which are at the following link: . </p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to amends its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

I can assure the workers impacted that there are Government supports in place to help them through this time. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the High Court has appointed joint liquidators of Debenhams Retail (Ireland) Limited. In this context, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have no statutory power to intervene in a court-supervised liquidation.  The liquidation process in this instance will be subject to oversight of the High Court.</p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a Job Loss Response Protocol with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will lead on this.  The protocol puts in place all the efforts to assist the workers. It includes welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and upskilling needs/opportunities.</p>  <p>  My colleague Minister Regina Doherty and her Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for providing support for the workers who have unfortunately lost their jobs due to the closure of the Debenhams Irish stores. </p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment is available for all persons who have become unemployed as a result of COVID-19 and is also payable with redundancy. Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance and Benefit are also options for financial aid for those persons now unemployed as a result of the closure of Debenhams Irish stores. </p>  <p>  In the case of any concession staff who are self-employed, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment applies if their trading income has collapsed to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time employment if it is offered to them. If a person subsequently applies for Jobseekers Benefit Self-Employed, that claim will be considered separately under the rules of that Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation and continues to be fully operational and available to any interested parties who may require it.  If employees of Debenhams have concerns or complaints regarding their employment rights the Customer Service Section of the WRC provides information in relation to employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and how to obtain redress where appropriate.</p></reply>

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Protocol. It will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as provided for in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  The HSA is deploying all of its available field inspectors across all sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. However, the Government will ensure that the HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities.</p>  <p>  While details of these additional resource are currently being finalised, the numbers working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given a commitment that inspectors from his Department will work with the HSA to ensure the implementation of the Protocol in workplaces. Compliance with the COVID-19 Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of the normal inspection regime. It will start shortly with around 200 officials from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, in line with the Government Roadmap. The details are being finalised at present. The HSA will carry a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA's Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. If, following contact from a worker, and follow-up engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. Importantly, if, on foot of an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action - up to and including the closure of a workplace - will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p>  <p>  However, even with the support of resources from other Government Departments, the inspectorate cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable.  Therefore, In the first instance, and in line with what is set out in the Protocol, employers and workers have a responsibility to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear and mandatory measures to protect the health and safety of all concerned. </p>  <p>  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.</p></reply>

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health.

It will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as provided for in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>  <p>  With regard to the establishment of a dedicated hotline for workers the Health and Safety Authority's workplace contact unit (WCU) is available to answer any queries employers, workers or members of the public may have in regard to all occupational safety and health matters including adherence with the provisions of Protocol. The WCU can be contacted by phone at 1890 289 389 or (01) 6147000 or at any time by email at wcu@hsa.ie, complaints to the WCU are managed on a completely confidential basis.</p>  <p>  The resources of the WCU have been supplemented by the transfer of staff members from my Department to assist with the expected increased demand on the WCU as the number of workplaces reopening will increase over coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It should be noted Section 27 of the Health, Safety and Welfare Act, 2005 prohibits an employer from penalising or threatening to penalise an employee with respect to any terms or condition of his/her employment, where the employee is exercising any right under safety and health legislation. The enforcement of Section 27 of the Health and Safety Act is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission.  Any employee who feels that their health and safety or employment rights have been breached in relation to COVID-19 in the workplace has recourse to the industrial mechanisms of the state. </p>  <p>  I would, however, also highlight the fact that concerns a worker might have around adherence to the Protocol can, and should be, brought to the attention of the lead COVID-19 worker representative. The Protocol emphasises that collaboration, communication and exchange of information between employers and employees is vital and both employer and employee have a role to play and responsibilities towards each other.</p></reply>

This PQ referenced a total of 415 inspections and investigations carried out by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) since the beginning of March to the date of that request.  </p>  <p>  Of the 415 inspections and investigations carried out by the Health and Safety Authority during this time, 217 resulted in reports of inspection being issued and 20 resulted in enforcement notices. The inspections were focused on core occupational safety and health issues. Since the beginning of March, 9 inspections have been undertaken which related to workplaces in Co. Tipperary.  </p>  <p>  On 18 May 2020, in line with Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, the HSA launched a national programme of inspections to check compliance with the national Return to Work Safely Protocol.  Over 500 onsite inspections have been undertaken by the Authority (as of Friday 22nd May) across a range of industry sectors.  As all of these inspections may not yet be recorded on the HSA&rsquo;s system, it is possible that a further number of these inspections would have involved workplaces in Co. Tipperary. </p>  <p>  The HSA has been deploying all of its available field inspectors across all sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the national Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p>  <p>  While the Authority is overseeing compliance with the Protocol, it has been recognised that given the nature of COVID-19, a cross Government inspection and compliance approach is required. To this end, a range of other inspection bodies will be mobilised by Government to also inspect and check compliance with the Protocol. The numbers of additional resources working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities.  Compliance with the Covid Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of their normal inspection regime.

However, as the Deputy rightly notes, I wrote to the Attorney General seeking his views on whether a provision similar to that introduced in the UK, essentially banning evictions during the crisis, could be made in law here in Ireland. I also asked him to consider if legislation could provide for a moratorium for businesses being required to pay rent for a premises, or portion of a premises, that it cannot use due to it adhering to restrictions. </p><p>I received a response on 13<sup>th</sup>May in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.</p><p>I have also asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>I would like to point out that, on 2<sup>nd</sup>May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver / rebate from 2019 (see further information below);</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p><p>The issue of supporting fixed costs, including commercial rents, was very much to the fore of our minds when the Government recently introduced the Restart Grant which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with re-opening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business. </p><p>The Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.</p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at www.gov.ie or on my Department&rsquo;s website ().</p></reply>

I am conscious that, for practical reasons, the impact on some businesses has been particularly severe. On Wednesday, 20 May I had a meeting via conference call with representatives of the hair and beauty and barber industry to discuss the implications of Covid-19 for their businesses.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to queries around cashflow and working capital, the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March and currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. </p>  <p>  Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.</p>  <p>  I would stress that the application process for these SBCI schemes is not onerous. Businesses need only confirm their eligibility for the scheme by application through the SBCI website. After a successful application, they will be issued an eligibility reference number, which they can use to make an application for a loan from one of the participating finance providers. </p>  <p>  As of 21 May, of the 2,591 applicants for eligibility under the scheme, only 13 had so far been found to be ineligible. The SBCI has also put in place a helpdesk that responds to any queries arising around the application process.</p>  <p>  Funding under this scheme is offered at favourable terms and at a lower interest rate than other similar SME lending available in the market. The maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).</p>  <p>  For micro-enterprises (businesses with fewer than 10 employees), the Covid-19 Loan, available from Microfinance Ireland (MFI), has been introduced as a support to help businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis to access funding. </p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six-month interest-free and repayment-free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans sought directly through MFI.</p>  <p>  In terms of new supports, on 2 May, I announced a &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years. Loans under the scheme will be offered at below market interest rates. </p>  <p>  Across the EU, different member states have prioritised different features of their respective liquidity supports to businesses, and so a direct comparison may not be appropriate. However, from the data available, Ireland&rsquo;s loan guarantee schemes appear to be in line with many countries: they cover 80% of the loan value, at commercial or slightly lower rates.</p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen. This fund will provide up to &euro;10,000 to micro and small businesses and will be implemented either through a rebate or waiver scheme based on rates payment for 2019, and will be targeted more widely at micro and small enterprises that have suffered large falls in revenue as a result of the crisis.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15th May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18th. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. The Protocol is available at .</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>I met recently with members of the hairdressing and beauty industry via teleconference and understand that preparatory work is being undertaken by the hairdressing sector and others in developing guidelines and safety protocols, with reference to the Government&rsquo;s Return to Work Safely Protocol. I requested that, where sectors are developing protocols or guides, they need to work together to align this work. For example, barbers' representative bodies should collaborate with hairdressers representative bodies on a single aligned protocol for their sector. I am keen to support sectors on their safe reopening on this aligned and collaborative basis and should the hairdressing sector wish to send me details of their sectoral protocol, I will be happy to convey these to the Minister for Health.</p><p>You should also note that, in order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see .</p><p>On 8th May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30th June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. If a company is currently in a rateable premises but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been.</p><p>Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.  If there are queries that are not addressed on the application form, businesses can contact the Business Support Unit in each local authority.  All information including the application form is available on the appropriate local authority website, the details of which are at the following link: .</p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country. I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to amend its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my announcement on 8 April this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m. </p>  <p>  Loans under this scheme are offered with a maximum interest rate of 4%. This represents a significant saving compared to other similar lending on the market for SMEs. Furthermore, this loan product provides for unsecured loans of up to &euro;500,000. Such a feature would not typically be available through normal bank loan products to SMEs, however, due to the guarantee structure in place for the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme it was feasible to provide for collateral-free loans and this provides for a significant reassurance for many businesses. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process. Businesses must first confirm their eligibility with the SBCI. Successful applicants will be issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to apply for a loan with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  As at 18 May, a total of 2,305 candidates have been deemed eligible to apply under the scheme at bank level. Of those, 248 have progressed to sanction at bank level to a total value of &euro;37,811,000 worth of loan approvals.</p></reply>

It is designed to help employers and workers in all sectors to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. It is a stand-alone Protocol that has also been designed to enable the introduction of further specific measures for particular sectors or workplaces. It is a living document which will change to reflect public health advice.</p>  <p>  The Protocol was developed following discussion and agreement at the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF), which is the forum for high level dialogue between Government, Union and Employer representatives on matters of strategic national importance. The work has been overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Meetings of LEEF took place on 9 April and 24 April 2020. In addition to these Plenary meetings, a sub-group dealing specifically with development of the Protocol met on numerous occasions and there were also ongoing bilateral engagements between officials and the members of LEEF as the Protocol was being drafted and signed-off by all parties.</p>  <p>  A high-level consultative stakeholder forum, under the aegis of LEEF, has now been established to oversee the implementation of the Protocol as the economy opens up in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.  As well as representatives from ITCU and Ibec, the forum includes membership from the Health and Safety Authority (HSA), the Health Services Executive (HSE), the Departments of Health; Agriculture Food and the Marine; Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of the Taoiseach.  The first meeting of the Forum was on Friday the 22 of May. </p>  <p>  Separately, in addition to the National Return to Work Safely Protocol, the Health and Safety Authority has now produced associated templates and checklists which have been prepared to help employers, business owners and managers to get their business up and running again and to also inform workers preventing the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace (see www.HSA.ie)</p>  <p>  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has published guidance documents in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic including a COVID-19 Workplace Protection and Improvement Guide and a COVID-19 Retail Protection and Improvement Guide which are available on the NSAI website (see www.nsai.ie)</p></reply>

While the right of workers to form associations and join a trade union is enshrined in Article 40 of the Irish Constitution, under Irish law there is no obligation on employers to recognise any union for the purposes of collective bargaining.  </p>  <p>  However, it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through legislation. </p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect in August 2015 provides an improved framework in this area for employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining. The 2015 Act provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place. The Act ensures that such workers, aided by a trade union, can advance claims about remuneration and conditions of employment and have these determined by the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  In addition to the improved framework introduced in the 2015 Act, the statutory Code of Practice on Victimisation was enhanced in October 2015 to include an explicit prohibition on the use by employers of inducements (financial or otherwise) designed specifically to have staff forego collective representation by a trade union.</p></reply>

There are currently a number of loan guarantee schemes in place which support the working capital needs of micro and small businesses.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland (MFI) was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them address funding needs and provides loans to microenterprises that do not meet the conventional risk criteria of banks. These loans are available to eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit. </p>  <p>  MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders. Where typical MFI loans are available at an interest rate of 6.8-7.8%, Covid-19 loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committee. Where an application is made directly to MFI, the interest rate is 5.5%. These loans also include an option for a moratorium on interest and repayments for the first six months.</p>  <p>  The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that are exposed to impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19, to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. </p>  <p>  Loans under this scheme are easier to access and offered at favourable terms when compared with other similar loans in the market, for example the maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).</p>  <p>  Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes available up to &euro;300 million of long-term loans and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating lenders. This scheme makes funding available for terms of 8-10 years, which is longer than is typically available in the Irish SME lending market due to the risks associated with longer-term loans. As with the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme, loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Uptake for the scheme has been strong and the initial funding has been almost fully subscribed. </p>  <p>  On 8 April I announced that this scheme would be expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  On 2 May, I announced a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available from AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank. This scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated as they seek access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. </p>  <p>  Implementation of this scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are already working urgently with the Office of the Parliamentary counsel on this drafting work. </p>  <p>  I have also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen.</p></reply>

Microenterprises are enterprises with less than ten employees.</p>  <p>  These loans are available for eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit.  Loans up to &euro;50,000 are available with terms that include a six-month interest-free and repayment-free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.  These loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% to all micro-enterprises where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committees.  An interest rate of 5.5% is applied to loans sought directly through MFI.</p>  <p>  In terms of new supports, on 2 May, I announced a &euro;2billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years. Loans under the scheme will be offered at below market interest rates. </p>  <p>  I also recently announced a new &euro;250m Restart Fund, which will be a critically important tool in supporting small businesses as they begin to reopen. </p>  <p>  This has been a period of unforeseeable disruption to businesses around the country, and I am conscious that there have been significant impacts on otherwise viable businesses. I would encourage businesses that have been negatively impacted as a result Covid-19 to take advantage of these supports wherever appropriate.</p></reply>

It is a particularly  difficult time for retailers who have had to close their doors in the interest of public health and adherence to the public health guidelines.  </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published on Friday 1st May sets out five stages for modifying the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals. The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>Large supermarkets have been able to remain open under the measures published on the 27th March which included the updated list of essential retail outlets . On 15 May, 2020 the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business from Monday May 18, 2020. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of essential retail outlets and other facilities that can therefore reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website  </p><p>Under the risk based approach deployed in the Roadmap, under Phase 2 (from June 8th) small retail outlets can reopen with a small number of staff on the basis that the retailer can control the number of individuals that staff and customers interact with at any one time. These measures will only come into place when the National Public Health Emergency Team says that the conditions are right for more relaxation of the restrictions in place to protect us all.</p><p>As Chairperson of the Retail Consultation Forum I have previously communicated with the major grocery multiples that where retail outlets and stores have discrete drapery and clothing sections or floors, these should close in line with the Government&rsquo;s announcements on non-essential retail. I understand some essential retailers such as large supermarkets may carry products which are incidental to their primary retail function. </p><p>I have separately communicated to the Retail Consultation Forum members and the grocery multiples, at the request of the Department of An Taoiseach, that the Garda&iacute; have asked them to consider not holding weekly specials over the next few weeks that risk giving rise to increased footfall at stores, and thereby present challenges to physical distancing.</p><p>The advice for individuals is still to stay at home as much as possible. During Phase 1, it is intended that customers should restrict visits to such stores for essential supplies. All retailers are encouraged to continue to provide on-line services where that is possible and appropriate to minimise footfall. All of these retail outlets must implement physical distancing measures and measures set out in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.

If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>It is imperative that all businesses must adhere to physical distancing requirements and the latest public health guidance at all times. </p><p>A wide range of financial supports and guidance has been made available by my Department and wider Government to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

My Department and I continue to monitor the needs of companies as the situation evolves and provide new supports where required and appropriate to do so.  </p>  <p>  Included in the now &euro;7.5 billion of liquidity supports which I announced over the past few weeks, is a Sustaining Enterprise Fund for Small Enterprises which is being administered by Enterprise Ireland. This fund for smaller businesses provides &euro;25,000 and &euro;50,000 in repayable advances, depending on size and turnover of company. This fund will provide liquidity to enable these enterprises to steer a pathway towards recovery and to introduce measures in response to the controls and health and safety requirements in line with changing work patterns and protocols and guidelines being introduced as we begin the re-opening of the economy. </p>  <p>  On 15th May last, the Government also agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.  The "Restart Grant" is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. It will be a critically important tool to support small businesses to reopen their doors and get back on their feet. This grant will enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business. </p>  <p>  The grants will be based on the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  Applications for the "Restart Grant" can be made online to all local authorities from Friday 22nd May. </p>  <p>  In addition to the extensive package of liquidity measures announced, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.  In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable under the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework. </p></reply>

It is a particularly difficult time for retailers who have had to close their doors in the interest of public health and adherence to the public health guidelines. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business published on Friday 1st May sets out five stages for modifying the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals. The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15 May, 2020 the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business from Monday May 18, 2020.

The categories of workers, list of essential retail outlets and other facilities that can therefore reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website  </p><p>With regard to homeware outlets, I wish to draw your attention to the list of retailers that can open published on 15th May, as hardware stores, builders merchants and those providing essential supplies and tools for gardening, farming and agriculture; garden centres and farmers markets; Opticians/Optometrists/Outlets providing hearing test services, selling hearing aids and appliances; retailers involved in the sale, supply and repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles and related facilities (e.g. tyre sales and repairs); office products and services; electrical, IT and phone sales, repair and maintenance services for home. This does not include homeware stores.  </p><p>Only stores providing homeware incidental to primary retail functions set out in the original Essential Services list are to reopen in Phase 1. It is not intended that stores which might also classify themselves as homeware, but primarily sell items such as furniture, bedding, curtains, kitchenware, crockery or other such items etc. should open.</p><p>The advice for individuals is still to stay at home as much as possible. During Phase 1, it is intended that customers should restrict visits to such stores for essential supplies. All retailers are encouraged to continue to provide on-line services where that is possible and appropriate to minimise footfall. All of these retail outlets must implement physical distancing measures and measures set out in the National Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p><p>Government will monitor progress on Phase 1 over the first two weeks and will assess progress next week. As set out in the Roadmap, Phase 2 is a reopening based on size rather than sector.  </p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate.

No. 370 of 2016) nor is there a requirement to notify the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority if an employee contracts Covid19. Therefore, outbreaks of an infectious disease, such as Covid19, are in the first instance reportable to Medical Officer of Health/Director of Public Health and they report the outbreak to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, under the HSE, who move to put in place infection control measures.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has been involved in reviewing matters relating to the meat processing sector over the past number of weeks as it is a member of the National Outbreak Control Team (NOTC) headed up by the HSE.  This team, which is led by the HSE, reports to the Department of Health and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  The NOTC is working to address the issue of outbreaks in meat processing plants and has input from professionals in public health, environmental health, animal health and the Health and Safety Authority, in relation to occupational health and safety.  The National Outbreak Control Team and local Outbreak Control Teams are in place to address outbreaks of COVID-19 and to recommend steps and measures to ensure that current and future outbreaks can be managed and brought under control as quickly as possible.  COVID-19 is first and foremost a public health issue so the first step must always be ensuring that measures are in place to manage and prevent outbreaks not just for the workers involved but also for the wider community where such workers live.</p><p>The National Outbreak Control Team has devised detailed guidance specifically tailored to the meat industry. This guidance document, which was issued to all meat processing facilities on 15 May 2020 covers:</p><p>- Infection prevention and control measures to prevent cases and control outbreaks for example screening at entry to the site;</p><p>- Steps to be taken when an individual case is suspected or confirmed; and</p><p>- Additional steps to be taken when an outbreak has occurred.</p><p>Information on this is available on the HPSC website at .  </p><p>Following the roll-out of the Return to Work Safely Protocol that preceded the start of Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy on 18<sup>th</sup>May last, over 500 onsite inspections (as of Friday 22<sup>nd</sup>May) were undertaken by the Health and Safety Authority last week across a range of industry sectors.  These inspections included plants in the meat processing sector. In relation to complaints specifically about meat processing plants, the Authority received seven complaints up to May 20<sup>th</sup>covering four different operators. As the Health and Safety Authority receives complaints on a confidential basis, a breakdown by County would not be appropriate for this sector. As part of the work with the National and Local OCTs mentioned above, the Health and Safety Authority are following up on each of these complaints, including completion of onsite inspections. It is worth noting that the Department of Agriculture, who have an ongoing role in meat processing plants, is also a member of the National OCT and they too will be checking compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol in such plants in the future too. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit is a confidential helpline for workers, employers and others to submit queries and complaints. This can be contacted by telephone 1890 289 389 and email wcu@hsa.ie. If any worker has a concern about Health and Safety in their workplace, whether that is in meat processing or elsewhere, they should contact the Health and Safety Authority Workplace Contact Unit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.1243.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700134#WRAA07200"><p>The power to enforce consumer protection legislation is reserved for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, a body that is statutorily independent of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I understand that a number of claims by owners of diesel vehicles affected by cheat devices, or defeat devices as they are also known, are currently before the courts in Ireland. In some cases, actions are being taken on behalf of a number of car owners. </p>  <p>  While car manufacturers have contested these claims, there have been important recent developments in response to claims for compensation in other European countries. In Germany, Volkswagen reached a settlement in late February 2020 with the Federal Association of Consumers following an action taken by the Association on behalf of 400,000 car owners. In the course of the proceedings, the State court hearing the case advised the parties to seek a settlement. Under the settlement, Volkswagen agreed to pay compensation totalling &euro;830 million to the car owners concerned. The compensation to be paid to individual owners ranges from &euro;1,350 to &euro;6,250 depending on the age of the vehicle.  On 25 May 2020, Germany&rsquo;s highest civil court, the Federal Court of Justice, ruled in a landmark judgment that the owner of a Volkswagen diesel minivan purchased in 2014 was entitled to return the vehicle to the manufacturer and receive a refund of approximately 80 per cent of the payment price. The judgment held that the vehicle&rsquo;s mileage should be taken into account in calculating the compensation payable to the owner. In a statement issued in response to the judgment, the company indicated that it would seek to bring compensation claims by a further 60,000 car owners in Germany to a prompt conclusion and would be making appropriate settlement proposals to these claimants. It is relevant to note that neither the German government nor the consumer protection authorities in Germany have had any direct involvement in either the compensation settlement with the Federal Association of Consumers or the compensation claims taken by individual car owners. </p>  <p>  In a significant preliminary judgment in a group action taken by 90,000 car owners, the High Court of England and Wales ruled on 6 April 2020 that the software installed in diesel cars manufactured by the Volkswagen Group was a defeat device under the relevant EU regulations. In an Opinion of 30 April 2020 in a case referred to the European Court of Justice, the Advocate General noted that the use of defeat devices that reduce the effectiveness of emission controls systems is prohibited under EU law and may be authorised only in exceptional circumstances where, for example, their use is justified to protect the engine against damage or accident and for the safe operation of the vehicle. This exception must however be interpreted strictly and is limited to protecting the engine against the occurrence of immediate and sudden damage and not against more long-term effects such as wear and tear or depreciation. Though the Opinion of the Advocate General is not binding on the European Court of Justice, it is followed by the Court in the majority of cases. </p>  <p>  I fully support the claims of car owners whose vehicles have been affected by cheat devices installed by car manufacturers to appropriate compensation for the detriment caused by these devices. In view in particular of the settlement reached with the Federal Association of Consumers in Germany and of the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice in Germany, it is now time for Volkswagen and other car manufacturers whose vehicles had cheat devices installed in them to come forward with fair proposals to compensate affected car owners in Ireland.</p></reply>

Section 61 provides that if the Government are of the opinion that abnormal circumstances prevail or are likely to prevail in relation to the supply of a product, the Government may by order declare that a state of emergency affecting the supply of that product exists.  </p>  <p>  The information available to me does not suggest that abnormal circumstances currently prevail in relation to the supply of hand washes and hand sanitisers. These products are relatively widely available in supermarkets and pharmacies and can also be purchased online. Therefore the requirement for abnormal circumstances in relation to the supply of hand washes and hand sanitisers, which is a prerequisite for the enactment of a maximum price order for these products, is not apparently met in present circumstances. </p>  <p>  Though the details supplied by the Deputy may suggest that high prices are being charged for particular hand sanitiser products in some cases, more reasonable prices are being charged in other cases. Where high prices are being charged by retailers, these may reflect high wholesaler prices set by suppliers, many of whom may be based outside Ireland. </p>  <p>  While there may well be cases of price hikes by individual traders, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data compiled by the Central Statistics Office do not suggest that retailers generally have taken advantage of the exceptional circumstances resulting from Covid-19 to introduce unjustified price increases. As measured by the CPI, prices were on average 0.4 per cent lower in April 2020 than in March 2020 and 0.1 per cent lower than in April 2019. Though prices for hygiene products which include liquid soaps but not hand sanitisers were 1 per cent higher in April 2020 than in March 2020, they were 1.7 per cent lower than in April 2019.  The price of these products had previously fallen by 1.8 per cent between February 2020 and March 2020.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have advised me that they have received a total of 13 complaints from consumers about the price of hand sanitisers since the start of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  If consumers consider that retailers are charging excessive prices for hand sanitisers or other products, the most effective recourse available to them is to take their custom to retailers charging more reasonable prices.</p></reply>

It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18<sup>th</sup>.

The Protocol should be used by all workplaces to adapt their workplaces procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures identified as necessary by the HSE and the Department of Health. It is operating in parallel with existing workplace health and safety statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise that, in the first instance, employers and workers have a responsibility to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying, and adhering to, the procedures and practices set out in the Protocol designed to protect the health and safety of all concerned. </p>  <p>  Under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) has full powers to oversee compliance with the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in their place of work.  While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs at this time. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol. It is ensuring compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. </p>  <p>  The HSA is carrying out a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline, tel: 1890 289 389 and email wcu@hsa.ie. If, following contact from a worker, and engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. However, if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers. Where relevant, the public health authorities will be involved.</p>  <p>  The Government is satisfied that in terms of overseeing adherence to the Protocol, there are sufficient legislative powers under the Health and Safety at work legislation, as well as existing and enhanced public health powers and the suite of employment rights legislation, to ensure, and enforce, if necessary, full compliance with the Protocol.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.1264.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700135#WRBB01800"><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, any thorough analysis of company closures on account of COVID-19 will require hard data which will arise from a variety of sources over the course of any given year. Insights are currently available from business surveys, stakeholder engagements, and real-time data at the level of employee where employees interact with the State&rsquo;s employment support system.</p><p>I would refer the Deputy to my Department&rsquo;s recent report on <i>Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity</i>which is publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The report includes analyses by the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform which makes clear that the most-heavily impacted sectors are Accommodation and Food, Construction, Administrative and Support Services, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade, and other Personal Services. Other sectors where the impacts are significant but somewhat less severe include the Manufacturing sector, and Transport and Storage. This pattern of sectoral impacts is similar to that observed in other countries. In terms of employment, the report observes that the Department of Finance&rsquo;s &lsquo;central&rsquo; scenario in its Stability Programme Update projects employment to fall substantially in 2020, with approximately 220,000 jobs being lost. The unemployment rate is projected to dramatically rise over the first half of the year, with an average rate in the mid 20% range during the second quarter, before falling over the second half of the year, as containment measures are gradually eased.</p><p>The CSO has conducted surveys on the business impacts of COVID-19 with the most recent release of 18th May last presenting findings of the second wave of the exercise. The Business Impact of COVID-19 Survey (BICS) has been created to measure and report quickly on the impact of COVID-19 on business in Ireland. A total of 3,000 enterprises were surveyed online for BICS Wave Two, with 24.5% of sampled enterprises completing the survey. The survey reports:</p><p>- Nearly one in four (23.9%) enterprises had ceased trading either temporarily or permanently on 3 May 2020.</p><p>- Almost a quarter (23.0%) of enterprises closed temporarily while 0.9% closed permanently.</p><p>- More than three in four (76.0%) of responding enterprises were continuing to trade in some capacity on 3rd May 2020. </p><p>- Among the enterprises who responded to both waves of the survey, one in six of those who had ceased trading temporarily by 19 April indicated that they had recommenced trading by 3 May.</p><p>Of note also is that:</p><p>- Two-thirds of Construction enterprises ceased trading either temporarily or permanently. Again, one would expect this to decrease arising from the return of construction activities in Phase 1 of the Roadmap.</p><p>- Seven in ten enterprises had lower turnover due to COVID-19 over the two-week period from 20 April to 3 May 2020.</p><p>- Exports decreased for over half of responding enterprises.</p><p>- Almost half of responding enterprises expressed confidence in having financial resources to continue operating for longer than six months.</p><p>- Over half of enterprises availed of Government supports schemes.</p><p>- Social distancing in the workplace implemented by over half of respondents. Over half (53.2%) of responding enterprises had implemented working arrangements to facilitate social distancing in the workplace at some point during the COVID-19 crisis. This rose to 77.4% of enterprises in the Manufacturing sector.</p><p>Turning to the issue of inspection and enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is the lead Agency in relation to oversight and compliance with the national Return to Work Safely Protocol. It will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate and as provided for in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p><p>The HSA is deploying all of its available field inspectors across all sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. However, the Government will ensure that the HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace/business inspection responsibilities. </p><p>While details of these additional resources are currently being finalised, the numbers working with the HSA will be in the hundreds, from across the system.  These will be specialist officials who already have sectoral business inspection responsibilities. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has given a commitment that inspectors from his Department will work with the HSA to ensure the implementation of the Protocol in workplaces. Compliance with the COVID-19 Return to Work Safely Protocol will become part of the normal inspection regime. It will start shortly with around 200 officials from the Environmental Health Service, and this number will increase steadily as officials from other parts of the system, with varying sectoral inspection and oversight responsibilities are brought on board, in line with the Government Roadmap. The details are being finalised at present.</p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18<sup>th</sup>. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>Businesses should review the Roadmap carefully and carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health measures.  Businesses should, based on their assessment, identify which category in which phase of reopening they will be in a position to reopen safely and in line with the continued public health measures.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p><p>The National Return to Work Safely Protocol is a useful guide for businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures. It sets out in very clear terms for employers and workers the steps that they must take firstly before a workplace reopens, and then while it continues to operate. <i></i></p><p>The Protocol is available at </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premises but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply.

The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less. The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are already working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this drafting work.</p>  <p>  My officials are also currently engaged with the European Commission in seeking approval for the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and ensuring the Scheme's adherence to the rules set out in their Temporary Framework.</p>  <p>  The Credit Guarantee Scheme operates using a portfolio approach whereby the entirety of a participating finance provider&rsquo;s qualifying finance agreements in respect of which guarantees have been given will be treated as a single portfolio under this Scheme. The portfolio of each financial provider is subject to a percentage portfolio cap which is set in the Credit Guarantee Act, 2012, as amended.  The portfolio cap under the current Credit Guarantee Scheme is 13%.  It is currently proposed to increase the portfolio cap for the Covid-19 CGS to 50%. </p>  <p>  An increase in the level of the portfolio cap will provide lenders with a higher incentive to offer facilities under the guarantee while at the same time the exposure to the exchequer and the risks associated with these loans will be shared between the Government and the financial providers. </p>  <p>  Comprehensive information regarding the portfolio caps on each credit guarantee scheme developed by other EU countries is not publicly available as different countries do not always publish this information.

Therefore an analysis of the type referred to in the question, including as regards impacts on the housing market, has not been undertaken.</p>  <p>  One area of involvement, through Enterprise Ireland, is in he promotion and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland supports a limited number of firms (approximately 750 out of a total of 50,000 construction enterprises) with construction products and services looking to engage with international markets. </p>  <p>  In an effort to realise the potential of digital tools and processes within Ireland&rsquo;s construction sector and improve productivity, Enterprise Ireland has played a lead role in supporting the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in recent years &ndash; including its initial convening of the National BIM Council in 2016. This has largely been driven by the increasing requirement for BIM in international markets, and the need to equip the Enterprise Ireland client base, as well as potential exporters, with the competencies necessary to engage with markets in which BIM adoption is standard.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out a gradual easing of restrictions with Phase 1 including a phased return of outdoor workers including construction workers. The roadmap suggests a gradual reopening of sites with a focus in Phase 1 on site preparation and outdoor work with indoor work accommodated in Phase 2. Social distancing requirements will continue to apply. The construction industry is largely not public facing and can adopt safe work practices in a controlled environment, ensuring all public health guidelines are adhered to. </p>  <p>  The reliance of the construction sector on foreign-national labour means there is potential for labour supply shortages as activity recommences if a share of the workforce has left Ireland during the COVID-19 restrictions. The sector also relies heavily on material inputs such as concrete, steel and other building materials and as such it will be important that supply chain issues (e.g. manufacturing, mining/quarrying, freight transport) do not prevent projects from progressing. Construction activity is also reliant on a functioning planning system (especially important for some strategic projects underway in the multinational sector) and use real estate services as the primary route to market. These interdependent activities, which are components of other sectors, would also need to be active in order to minimise disruptions. Ensuring that bottlenecks in the supply of labour, raw materials and supporting sectors are swiftly addressed will minimise the potential impact on productivity in the construction sector as activity restarts.</p>  <p>  In support of the work of the Construction Sector Group - composed of the key Construction stakeholders in the public and private sectors to support the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, and which includes representation from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation - the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commissioned an international benchmarking and economic analysis of the causes of productivity trends in the construction sector in Ireland. This was prior to the impact of Covid-19 on the Irish and global economies. </p>  <p>  This analysis, which is now complete, contains a series of recommendations for enhancing the productivity performance of the Irish Construction sector, and the membership of the Construction Sector Group has approved an action plan to deliver these actions. The implementation of these actions will be monitored through the quarterly meetings of the Group and which will form part of its annual work programme.</p></reply>

There are currently a number of loan guarantee schemes in place which support the working capital needs of impacted businesses.</p><p>Microfinance Ireland (MFI) was introduced as a support to microenterprises to help them address funding needs and provides loans to microenterprises that do not meet the conventional risk criteria of banks. These loans are available to eligible microenterprises responding to Covid-19-related difficulties, the negative impact of which must be a minimum of 15% of actual or projected income or profit. </p><p>MFI provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders. Where typical MFI loans are available at an interest rate of 6.8-7.8%, Covid-19 loans are available at an interest rate of 4.5% where the application is made through the network of Local Enterprise Offices around the country, or where referred by a bank or Local Development Committees. Where an application is made directly to MFI, the interest rate is 5.5%. These loans also include an option for a moratorium on interest and repayments for the first six months. </p><p>The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The scheme is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that are exposed to impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19, to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. </p><p>Loans under this scheme are easier to access and offered at favourable terms when compared with other similar loans in the market, for example the maximum interest rate under the scheme is 4% and loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. Applicants may also be able to avail of a three-month interest-only payment period (depending on your lender&rsquo;s assessment of your application).</p><p>Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.</p><p><b>Table of uptake: </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme </th>       <th>Applications</th>       <th>Amount drawn down</th>       <th>Number of Business that availed of scheme </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan </td>       <td>2,574 inquiries</td>       <td>&euro;9,158,992 </td>       <td>329 loans sanctioned</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SCBI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme </td>       <td>2,305 deemed eligible applicants </td>       <td>loans sanctioned to a total value of &euro;37,811,000</td>       <td>273 loans sanctioned(all figures as of May 21st 2020) </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As part of the 8 April announcement, I also announced a further &euro;200m expansion of the Future Growth Loan Scheme. This scheme initially made available a fund of &euro;300m to support loans to eligible businesses for strategic investment. The current scheme provides loans from &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for farmers) to &euro;3m per eligible business, for terms of 8-10 years. My Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The Government on 2<sup>nd</sup>May also announced a new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available from AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank.  </p><p>This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less. The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are already working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this drafting work. </p></reply>

These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>The growth in demand for shopping online domestically and globally is driving the retail sector more broadly to develop its online capability in order to enhance its competitiveness. Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. In April of this year I increased support for two online trading initiatives to a total of &euro;7.6m: Trading Online Vouchers for micro enterprises in partnership with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton TD; and a special Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme for indigenous retailers with 10 or more employees administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Firstly, in conjunction with Minister Bruton's Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, I have increased support for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with less than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector through the Local Enterprise Office network nationwide. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key government grant to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period, when so many small businesses are closed to the public. However, the value of the Trading Online Voucher will stand to businesses for years to come, boosting revenue, and helping sustain and create jobs into the future.</p><p>The Voucher can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers, with co-funding from the business currently set at just 10 percent. The Voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. Training and further business supports are also provided along with the Scheme. Flexibilities to the Trading Online Voucher scheme are now in place allowing businesses apply for a second voucher where they have successfully utilised their first one, which brings the overall total voucher amount available up to &euro;5,000 for each eligible business.  Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at<i></i></p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme is complementary to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Trading Online Voucher Scheme. The objective of the Scheme, administered by Enterprise Ireland, is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector which have started an online journey, which will have the most immediate impact enabling them to respond to both domestic and international consumer demand with a competitive online offer.</p><p>My Department has introduced this Scheme in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the urgent need for retail companies to achieve a step change in online capability. Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.  The total fund size will be up to &euro;2 million under this call. Further details on this Scheme available at .</p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premise but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been. Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.  If there are queries that are not  on the application form, businesses can contact the Business Support Unit in each local authority.</p><p>All information including the application form will be available on the local authority website, the details of which are at the following link: . </p><p>I am committed to supporting the needs of the retail sector at this time and in developing their online capability and enhancing their competitiveness.</p><p>Finally, it is important that all businesses check  for the latest information, public health advice and guidelines from Government in relation to Covid-19.</p></reply>

It also recognises that the Local Enterprise Offices have made a marked improvement in the promotion of and supports for entrepreneurs and it is the LEOs that are the first stop shop for anyone thinking of starting a business, including those with disabilities. </p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), located in the Local Authorities nationwide offer advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone intending to start or grow a business. They operate on an equal opportunities basis and offer their services to any entrepreneur, regardless of their situation, in a fair and even-handed manner and in compliance with Government policy and all legal requirements. </p><p>The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. In that regard, information in respect of a client&rsquo;s disability or otherwise is not relevant, this also applies to the collation of the LEO Annual Employment Survey with regard to individuals employed in businesses supported by the 31 Local Enterprise Offices.  </p><p>The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to any microenterprises (up to 10 employees) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories</p><p><b>- Feasibility Grants</b>(investigating the potential of a business idea)</p><p><b>- Priming Grants</b>(to part-fund a start-up)</p><p><b>- Business Development grants</b>for existing businesses that want to expand.</p><p>For Start- ups or expanding businesses, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training or provide a mentor to work with the business proposer including courses such as:</p><p><b>- The Start Your Own Business programme</b>guides clients through the various aspects of business and business planning.  The objective is to assist clients in assessing their idea, its viability and to decide if they should proceed or take a step back.</p><p><b>- The Mentor Programme</b>is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.</p><p>Full detail on LEO supports are available on the Local Enterprise Office website at .  </p><p>Government has also responded rapidly to put in place appropriate supports for businesses that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19 but has not specifically introduced loan supports for self-employed persons with a disability.  The Government continues to explore every available avenue for the delivery of further supports. To date, supports to businesses include:</p><p>- Microenterprises can access Covid-19 loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland. Loans are available at an interest rate of between 4.5% and 5.5%, with the first six months interest and repayment free. Businesses can apply through their nearest LEO or directly at microfinanceireland.ie.</p><p>- The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme for eligible businesses opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The maximum loan size under the scheme is &euro;1.5m (first &euro;500,000 unsecured) and the maximum interest rate is set at 4%. Eligibility criteria apply. Applications can be made through the SBCI website at sbci.gov.ie</p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme supports loans of up to &euro;1m for periods of up to seven years. Applications can be made to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.</p><p>These schemes aside, we will also be supporting additional lending through the banks for longer-term loans to aid with strategic investment as the COVID-19 crisis moderates. To further assist companies to respond to these challenges, and in doing so stabilise and rebuild their business, Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has launched a new suite of COVID-19 supports; these are:</p><p><b>- Sustaining Enterprise Fund</b>: This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15 per cent or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objectives of the scheme are to:</p><p>- Ensure eligible companies have access to the necessary liquidity; and</p><p>- Sustain business so that companies can return to viability and contribute to the recovery of the Irish economy.</p><p>The Fund will provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.</p><p>This fund will provide a &euro;25k to &euro;50k short term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly within a three year time frame. </p><p><b>- NEW HPSU:</b>This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies who, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projected sales growth and whose fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000<b></b>per undertaking in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p><b>- Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: </b>A &euro;5k grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. 337 applications have been received for Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant.</p><p><b>- Lean Business Continuity Voucher: </b>A &euro;2.5k voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. 156 applications have been received for the LEAN Business Continuity Voucher.</p><p><b>- Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme</b>is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland provides support for new start-ups and existing business through a wide range of initiatives and supports. The awarding of funding by the agency is based on eligibility, evaluation criteria and assessed company need.</p><p>I will continue to ensure equal opportunities for entrepreneurship across the population and to address gaps in the self-employment and entrepreneurship activity rates of those with disabilities. My agencies continue to work very closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Intreo Offices in every county to ensure those seeking to get back to work or start a business are aware of the range of supports available. </p></reply>

The Roadmap sets out how we can keep the level of transmission of COVID-19 as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions in proportion with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by businesses reopening.  It is important to note that all decisions taken by Government on the timing of any lifting of restrictions as envisaged in Phases 2 to 5 of the Roadmap will be guided by the public health advice at the time.</p><p>On 15<sup>th</sup>May the Government announced that we would move to Phase 1 of the Roadmap from Monday May 18<sup>th</sup>. This is in line with advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The categories of workers, list of retailers and other facilities that can reopen under Phase 1 are available on the Government&rsquo;s website gov.ie. </p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to amend its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase.</p><p>A key tool in implementing the Roadmap is the Return to Work Safely Protocol. This Protocol clearly and comprehensively sets out the steps and processes employers and workers must take to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace. The Protocol is available at .</p><p>The protocol was developed and agreed in consultation with the members of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the forum for high-level dialogue between the Government and union and employer representatives on labour market issues. Participants in this process included IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation. </p><p>The Health and Safety Authority, which is an agency of my Department, is the lead agency in overseeing compliance with the Protocol in the workplace.  If employers or employees need further guidance on the Protocol, the HSA Helpline can be contacted at 1890 289 389 or wcu@hsa.ie. </p><p>Specific sectors may need to introduce additional safeguards but the Return to Work Safely Protocol sets the standard set of measures required in every workplace. </p><p>Since this crisis began, I have convened numerous meetings of the Enterprise Forum and the Retail Consultation Forum, which I chair. The Enterprise Forum enables me to meet with business representatives and our State agencies with a view to identifying solutions to key challenges faced by my Department, such as Brexit. The Retail Consultation Forum provides a platform for a structured engagement between the Retail Sector and relevant Government Departments/bodies. Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector. I have also met with other representatives of employers and employees and the response has been very positive. I will continue to maintain that dialogue with stakeholders so that we can work towards getting people back to work safely.</p><p>The Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19. The feedback I received from engagement with business and sectoral representatives since this crisis began enabled me to gain an insight into the difficulties faced by businesses. The supports are accordingly designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead<i>.</i>For a full list of supports for business please see . </p><p>In April of this year, I opened applications for a new &euro;2 million COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme to support indigenous Irish retailers to sustain their business through the crisis and into the future.  It is one of two online trading schemes that has received additional funding to support firms in this difficult period.</p><p>On 8<sup>th</sup>May the Government agreed details of a further support which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant is equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.  If a company is currently in a rateable premises but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been.</p><p>Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities and further information is available on the application form.  If there are queries that are not addressed on the application form, businesses can contact the Business Support Unit in each local authority. All information including the application form is available on the appropriate local authority website, the details of which are at the following link: . </p><p>In addition to the range of business supports which are being administered by the agencies under the aegis of my Department, I am aware that sector specific actions are also being taken by my Ministerial colleagues. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr  Shane Ross T.D.  and Minister of State for Tourism and Sport, Mr Brendan Griffin T.D. announced on the 20th May the formation of a special Tourism Recovery Taskforce with an Independent Chair, dedicated to spearheading economic recovery for the tourism sector. Earlier, on 3rd April, a range of specific measures to support the artistic and cultural life of the nation at this difficult time, with a particular focus on wellbeing through personal and community creativity, was announced by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Ms Josepha Madigan T.D.</p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.  My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.</p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to amends its plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase. It will be subject to regular review in the context of the progression or suppression of the disease in Ireland or new guidance or research that emerges from other sources.</p></reply>

However, the issues around any possible Irish mechanism are currently under active consideration. </p>  <p>  An EU Regulation on Investment Screening is due to take effect from 11 October 2020. The aim of the Regulation is to establish a cooperation framework within the European Union for the screening of foreign direct investments.</p>  <p>  The Regulation is a response to growing concerns within Europe about the potential acquisition of, and investment in, strategic European companies by foreign-owned firms that may undermine a Member State&rsquo;s security or public order.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, Investment Screening has recently assumed greater political focus both globally and within Europe as a result of Covid-19. The EU is concerned that strategic European investments are currently experiencing severe economic vulnerability and low share prices and could be vulnerable to being acquired by third countries. As such, Investment Screening has been the subject of recent Guidance from the Commission calling upon Member States that already have an existing screening mechanism in place to make full use of tools available to them under EU and national law to prevent capital flows from non-EU countries that could undermine Europe's security or public order. In the Guidance, the Commission also calls on the remaining Member States to look at establishing a fully-fledged screening mechanism.</p>  <p>  While the EU Regulation provides a framework for cooperation through which Member States and the European Commission can exchange information and raise specific concerns about a potential foreign investment, it does not require Member States to adopt or maintain a screening mechanism for foreign direct investment.  It does, however, contain a number of mandatory requirements - including a requirement to nominate national contact points in each Member State and to comply with certain annual reporting requirements. </p>  <p>  As I indicated in my response to the Deputy's earlier question on Investment Screening on 27 April last, in advance of the Regulation taking effect in October, my Department has already established a dedicated Unit, the Investment Screening Unit comprising of 2.5 staff members. This Unit has been notified to the European Commission as the designated national contact point for Ireland. The Unit will undertake and fulfil the cooperation and reporting obligations under the Regulation and is also developing a range of policy options for consideration by Government.</p>  <p>  As part of this ongoing work on investment screening, my Department has established and chairs an interdepartmental group comprising key Departments that are likely to have an interest in the screening of Investments. A range of bilateral consultations on Investment Screening have also been held with key stakeholders and Government agencies, and the models employed in range of other countries are being examined by officials.</p>  <p>  Any formal screening mechanism would need to be designed and tailored so that is appropriate to Ireland&rsquo;s needs while also meeting our obligations under the EU Regulation.  In particular, any mechanism would need to balance Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as a location for inward investment, with a robust, but proportionate Investment Screening Mechanism that protects security and public order.</p>  <p>  A proposal to introduce a screening mechanism would require a Government decision and would also require the introduction of domestic legislation in this regard. As noted, it is intended to bring proposals in this regard before a new Government, when formed, outlining the policy options and the legislative requirements needed to introduce any formal Screening mechanism. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, to further build on our analysis and research, and to ensure that the policy options presented to Government are as comprehensive as possible, my Department undertook a public consultation on Investment Screening. This consultation affords an opportunity to all interested stakeholders to contribute to the development of policy in this area. This closing date for submissions has just passed and officials are currently reviewing the content received. </p></reply>

My immediate concern is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this announcement. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years, which makes this news all the more difficult.</p>  <p>  The IDA have been in contact with senior management at National Pen and will continue to work closely with the company to support and maintain the Dundalk operation. The company has stated that it has experienced a significant decline in demand for its products. It has advised the IDA that the steps being taken now are necessary to secure the long-term future of the business and preserve the positions of the majority of the workers at the Dundalk operation. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has already made the company aware of the Government supports that are available. I understand that the IDA will also be working with National Pen&rsquo;s HR team to connect staff with other clients in the IDA portfolio in due course. </p>  <p>  The Government will make every State support available to employees impacted by this announcement. My Department, the Department of Social Protection, as well as our State Agencies, will all be doing their utmost to help workers transition and find new employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that, despite the loss of these roles, National Pen will continue to be a significant employer in the region. The company has confirmed that it remains committed to operating in Ireland and will retain 380 staff in Dundalk. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s economy, as we all know, is outward-facing, export-orientated and reliant to a large degree on global FDI. This means that when a multinational company makes decisions, either as result of Covid-19 or for other business reasons, we unfortunately can feel the impact here.</p>  <p>  However, the employment situation in Louth has been positive in recent years with over 4,400 staff employed in IDA firms in Louth, a more than threefold increase on 2010. The pipeline of new jobs has included significant investments from Wuxi Biologic, Panasonic, Wuxi Vaccines and PCI Pharma.</p></reply>

These applications will be prioritised for payment by the local authorities.</p><p>To avail of the Restart Grant, applicants must be a commercial business and be in the Local Authorities Commercial Rates Payment System and:</p><p>1. have an annual turnover of less than &euro;5m and employ between 1 to 50 people;</p><p>2. have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in turnover to end June 2020;</p><p>3. commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed;</p><p>4. declare the intention to retain employees that are on The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p><p>Subject to the qualifying criteria outlined above, any business that has a commercially rateable premises including those businesses with outstanding rates bills are eligible to make an application if they meet the criteria. The grant will be the amount of the rates demand in respect of calendar year 2019 only, subject to a minimum of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000. </p><p>If a company is currently in a rateable premise but was not rate-assessed in 2019 it is still eligible to apply. The local authority can pay the grant based on an estimate of what the rates demand for 2019 would have been.</p><p>The grant will be the amount of rates demand in respect of calendar year 2019 only, subject to a minimum of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000. </p><p>Within the funding available, the priority has been to support those who have suffered most, including closure of the business, but who will still have incurred ongoing costs. </p><p>The grant can be used to defray ongoing fixed costs, for replenishing stock and for measures needed to ensure employee and customer safety. </p><p>Businesses who are not in a rateable premises are not eligible. </p><p>Non-commercial organisations such as community and sporting premises are not eligible.  Businesses that do not operate from rateable premises (tradesmen, service providers, etc) are not eligible.</p><p>I understand the concerns relating to business that do not operate from commercial premises. </p><p>However, tradespersons and service providers that operate on a mobile basis or that could continue to work remotely have been better placed to continue to trade and many don&rsquo;t have the same levels of losses, of ongoing overheads or reopening costs that a fixed premises business will have. Within the funding available, the priority has been to support those who have suffered most, including closure of the business, but who will still have incurred ongoing costs. </p><p>We are also focussed on businesses that have continued to employ people, with the aid of the Temporary Wage Support Scheme, so that those jobs will be retained as soon as the business re-opens. </p><p>This direct grant support is part of the wider &euro;12bn package of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.</p><p>Applications for the Restart Grant can be made online directly to local authorities since Friday May 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020 and further information can be obtained by contacting the Business Support Unit of the relevant local authority.</p><p>We will monitor the Restart Grant as it is rolled out and continue to take on board issues as they arise.</p></reply>

This Scheme forms a major component of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment.  It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years.  The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.  </p>  <p>  The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries.  These sectors are excluded from the current Credit Guarantee Scheme under State aid rules. They will be included under the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme arising from the amended State Aid rules under the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework.  The Scheme will also be available to small Mid-Caps (up to 499 employees) which are also excluded from the current Scheme.  </p>  <p>  My officials are currently engaged with the European Commission in seeking approval for the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and ensuring the Scheme's adherence to the rules set out in their Temporary Framework.   </p>  <p>  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are already working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this drafting work. </p></reply>

Loan guarantee structures are a very effective response to the liquidity crisis, in particular where it is feasible to access counter-guarantees through the European Investment Bank [EIB]. </p>  <p>  There are significant advantages to operating loan guarantee schemes through participating financial providers. This allows the Government to leverage existing commercial lending infrastructure to provide an efficient mechanism for making competitive lending products available to Covid-19-impacted businesses. The guarantee structure ensures that eligible applicants to the schemes represents a reduced risk to the participating lender, which in turn ensures access to appropriate financing for more businesses. </p>  <p>  However, the operation of these loan schemes through the financial providers also means that interest is a feature of the loans, as some interest must be charged by the lenders to cover overheads and capital costs if they are to continue to work with Government.</p>  <p>  That said, the interest rates on the MFI Covid-19 loan scheme have been reduced from the interest rates of 6.8-7.8% typically offered by the MFI to a lower rate of 4.5-5.5%. The interest rate of 4% under the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme represents a savings when compared with other similar lending available in the market, while the availability of loans of under &euro;500,000 unsecured ensures that the scheme is more accessible to businesses.</p>  <p>  Across the EU, different member states have prioritised different features of their respective liquidity supports to businesses, and so a direct comparison may not be appropriate. However, from the data available, Ireland&rsquo;s loan guarantee schemes appear to be in line with many countries: they cover 80% of the loan value, at commercial or slightly lower rates.</p></reply>

I am keenly aware that some businesses are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.</p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank / lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18<sup>th</sup>March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30th April last.</p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.</p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.</p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.</p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I received a response on 13<sup>th</sup>May in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>I would like to point out that, on 2<sup>nd</sup>May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver / rebate from 2019 (see further information below);</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p><p>The issue of supporting fixed costs, including commercial rents, was very much to the fore of our minds when the Government recently introduced the Restart Grant which will give direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with re-opening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business.</p><p>The Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th</sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000.</p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at www.gov.ie or on my Department&rsquo;s website ().</p></reply>

On 8 April I announced significant expansions to both schemes.</p><p>On 2 May, I announced a new &euro;2bn Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. This Scheme forms a major component of the government&rsquo;s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year. The guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million that have a maximum term of six years. The guarantee structure will reduce the risk exposure to the bank and open up lending which banks may otherwise have considered to be too high a risk.</p><p>The Pillar Banks have assured me that they will support businesses through the Covid-19 Crisis, and I continue to meet with them regularly to make sure they are delivering as such. The banks have had to deal with an overwhelming increase in activity since the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and this may have caused some delays in dealing with new business loans leading to a perceived reluctance to lend. While the State supported loan guarantee schemes provide risk coverage to the banks, banks do have an obligation to undertake credit assessment of the loans applied for according to their own policy and procedures. In these uncertain times, this poses many complexities. </p><p>I must highlight also that for micro-enterprises that have not achieved lending through the banks, application for a loan through Micro Finance Ireland could be considered. Microenterprises can access COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland. The terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period.</p><p>In addition, the newly launched &euro;250m Restart Grant allows for direct grant aid to micro and small businesses of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000. Application forms now available online on all local authority websites.  The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. </p><p>To qualify for the Restart Grant, a business must</p><p>- have a turnover of less than &euro;5m and have 50 or less employees.</p><p>- have suffered a projected 25%+ loss in revenue from 1<sup>st</sup>April 2020 to 30th June 2020.</p><p>- commit to remain open or to reopen if it was closed. The business must also declare the intention to retain employees that are benefitting from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak will result in a serious downturn in the Irish, EU and wider global economy. To assist companies to respond to these challenges, and in doing so stabilise and rebuild their business, Enterprise Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has launched a new suite of COVID-19 supports; these are:</p><p><b>Sustaining Enterprise Fund -</b>This &euro;180 million fund will provide support to eligible manufacturing and internationally traded services companies employing 10 or more employees who have been impacted by a 15 per cent or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit, and/or have a significant increase in costs as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The objectives of the scheme are to:</p><p>- Ensure eligible companies have access to the necessary liquidity; and</p><p>- Sustain business so that companies can return to viability and contribute to the recovery of the Irish economy.</p><p>The Fund will provide financial assistance in the form of repayable advances of up to a maximum of &euro;800,000 per company.</p><p><b>Sustaining Enterprise Fund &ndash; Small Enterprise:</b>This fund will provide a &euro;25k to &euro;50k short term working capital injection to eligible smaller companies to support business continuity and strengthen their ability to return to growth and be trading strongly in 3 years&rsquo; time. </p><p><b>A NEW HPSU fund to Sustain Enterprises:</b>This fund is aimed at EI High Potential Start-Up companies who, due to the Covid-19 pandemic are facing delays to projected sales growth and whose fundraising plans are significantly impacted or stalled. Under this fund, HPSUs can apply for co-investment of &euro;50,000<b></b>per undertaking in the form of equity or convertible debt instruments.</p><p>In addition to this fund Enterprise Ireland has launched the following supports:</p><p><b>- Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: </b>A &euro;5k grant for eligible companies to work with third party consultants to prepare a detailed financial plan with forecasts and assumptions. 337 applications have been received for Covid-19 Business Financial Planning Grant.</p><p><b>- Lean Business Continuity Voucher: </b>A &euro;2.5k voucher for eligible companies to access training or advisory services support related to the continued operation of their business during the current pandemic. 156 applications have been received for the LEAN Business Continuity Voucher.</p><p><b>- Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme</b>is a grant for retail companies with greater than 10 employees to develop a more competitive online offer.  This competitive call has a budget of &euro;2 million. Successful applicants will receive funding support of up to 80% of project costs, with a maximum grant of &euro;40,000.</p><p>A wide range of financial supports and guidance has been made available by my Department and wider Government to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

This development will remove any remaining concerns that religious influence might be brought to bear on the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH).  It also paves the way for the finalisation of the legal framework which will protect the State&rsquo;s investment in the new hospital and ensure that the new NMH will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  The governance arrangements for the new NMH will be based on the provisions of the Mulvey Agreement. The Mulvey Agreement was an agreement between the NMH and the SVHG which was finalised in November 2016, following extensive mediation discussions. This Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - NMH at Elm Park DAC - and ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the new hospital without religious, ethnic or other distinction. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with the SVHG, the NMH, the HSE and the Chief State Solicitor's Office in relation to the legal framework.  The new hospital, which will remain in State ownership, will be built on a site leased from the SVHG for a period of 99 years. The State will provide an Operating Licence to the NMH at Elm Park DAC and the SVHG to facilitate the provision of health services in the new building.  </p></reply>

The restrictions imposed on movement and events (gatherings) are consistent with the recommendations of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and have regard to the immediate, exceptional and manifest risk posed to human life and public health by the spread of Covid-19.  I believe these restrictions represent a necessary and proportionate response to an unprecedented situation.  We have now however moved to a new stage where easing of restrictions has begun.  The Regulations were recently amended to extend their date of operation until 8 June 2020 and, in line with public health advice and the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, to provide for the limited lifting of some of the restrictions imposed by them.  As we move forward with further easing of restrictions it is important to keep in mind the on-going threat that Covid-19 represents, taking care to ensure that any loosening of restrictions is on the basis of medical guidance and advice.  We must also continue to keep in mind human rights and civil liberty issues and I have asked my officials to ensure that there is continued consideration of these issues as the next stage of easing restrictions proceeds.</p></reply>

The impact of any imported cases on disease spread would be all the greater in the context of easing of domestic restrictions and the resultant increased movement and contact between people. In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions. Ultimately, the progress towards suppression of community transmission which has been achieved and which should allow for greater resumption of social and economic life in Ireland could be endangered. </p><p>To date, Ireland has introduced a range of travel related measures including issuing advice against non-essential international travel on 13th March.  As of 24th April, the public health advice for passengers arriving into the State from overseas is to self-isolate for 14 days. </p><p>From 28<sup>th</sup>May, it will be a legal requirement for passengers arriving from overseas to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. The information on the form may be used to assist our contact tracing teams. </p><p>My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is also developing proposals to strengthen the 14 days self-isolation arrangements for travellers from overseas. These proposals will include possible enforcement measures.  The issue of imposing mandatory quarantine for a 14 day period, to be considered as the situation evolves, was mentioned in the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business</i>. </p><p>It is intended that self-isolation arrangements would apply to passengers arriving from overseas, irrespective of the country from which they are travelling. Passengers transiting to another jurisdiction and who will not be residing in the State, including transiting to Northern Ireland, will be exempt.

The impact of any imported cases on disease spread would be all the greater in the context of easing of domestic restrictions and the resultant increased movement and contact between people. In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions. Ultimately, the progress towards suppression of community transmission which has been achieved and which should allow for greater resumption of social and economic life in Ireland could be endangered. </p><p>To date, Ireland has introduced a range of travel related measures including issuing advice against non-essential international travel on 13th March.  As of 24th April, the public health advice for passengers arriving into the State from overseas is to self-isolate for 14 days. </p><p>From 28<sup>th</sup>May, it will be a legal requirement for passengers arriving from overseas to complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form. The information on the form may be used to assist our contact tracing teams. </p><p>My Department, in consultation with other relevant Departments, is also developing proposals to strengthen the 14 days self-isolation arrangements for travellers from overseas. These proposals will include possible enforcement measures.  The issue of imposing mandatory quarantine for a 14 day period, to be considered as the situation evolves, was mentioned in the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business</i>. </p><p>It is intended that self-isolation arrangements would apply to passengers arriving from overseas, irrespective of the country from which they are travelling. Passengers transiting to another jurisdiction and who will not be residing in the State, including transiting to Northern Ireland, will be exempt. Any mandatory arrangements would be kept under regular review. </p><p>There is ongoing close engagement at political and official levels between my Department and the authorities in both Northern Ireland and the UK. These close contacts will continue over the coming weeks. </p><p>Complimentary measures applying to international travel, such as temperature testing at airports, will remain under consideration but are not envisaged at this time. </p></reply>

This is in line with Phase 1 of the Government's Plan for the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, from 18 May.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a suite of measures to support small, medium and larger businesses that are negatively impacted by COVID-19 including a Restart grant for which application can be made on line to local authorities. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has published a Return to Work Safely Protocol, which is designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority also provides information and advice for employers and employees in this regard. </p>  <p>  A national approach to the supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the Public Dental Service of the HSE has been initiated.  Dentists contracted by the HSE under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme can apply to the HSE for PPE. Additional PPE, above the normal PPE used in dentistry, may currently be required in certain instances depending on the occupational risk assessment of the dentist. However, the Dental Council is deliberating further on this and definitive clarification is awaited as to if and when such PPE may be required. </p></reply>

The HSE has reported that it was not aware of any indications that the private patient group had difficulty accessing dental care when it was restricted to emergency care only. </p>  <p>  The necessary legislative amendments have now been made and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has worked with the dental profession and in particular the Dental Council, to provide revised guidance for the profession to allow for the resumption of the safe provision of routine care.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput. The HSE is currently engaging with hospital groups to assess the impact of these guidelines on activity. The completion of this work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints, including ENT appointments and procedures. </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues  to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress  the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to provide services in a different way, which includes virtual clinics for some out-patient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>Guidance in relation to specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector. </p></reply>

Tribunals are comprised of three people (a chair, who is a solicitor or barrister, a consultant psychiatrist and a lay person.) In making its decision, a tribunal reviews the order, the patient's record, input from the patient or a legal representative, input from the patient's consultant psychiatrist and a report from an independent consultant psychiatrist, who examines the patient and interviews the responsible consultant psychiatrist. </p>  <p>  The amendments to the 2001 Act, which were the result of detailed consultation by the Department with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE, were necessary to ensure that the rights of involuntarily detained patients under the 2001 Act would continue to be vindicated in the current public health emergency. </p>  <p>  The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 introduced a "cascading" approach to provisions under section 48 of the 2001 Act.  Under the new, temporary measures, every effort is made to maintain three-person tribunals, including remote working. However, in circumstances where three-person tribunals cannot take place due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, one-person tribunals, comprised of the Chairperson, are provided for. The amendments retain the key features of the tribunal process - independent legal representation, report by an independent consultant psychiatrist and an independent review of the patient&rsquo;s detention. </p></reply>

This public health-led approach is to inform a slow, gradual, step-wise and incremental reduction of the current social distancing measures, in a risk-based, fair and proportionate way, with a view to effectively suppressing the spread of COVID-19 while enabling the return of social and economic activity.  </p><p>  Psychiatrists', counsellors' and psychotherapists' work on essential cases can be considered part of essential Social Care services. Subject to adhering to the current public health guidelines around social distancing, it is up to the individual's own judgement as to whether to meet clients face-to-face or through remote means. </p><p>I fully appreciate that there is significant planning required for mental health practitioners to move to a new model of operating with the challenges of COVID-19.  It is, however, the responsibility of employers (and self-employed people) to apply a risk-based approach to returning to work and to prepare to apply the precautions necessary to comply fully with public health advice. </p><p>I would also draw your attention to the Return to Work Safely Protocol, which was published by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on 9 May.

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens  and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p></reply>

As a new virus, the world has been learning as the situation with the virus has evolved and new evidence becomes available.  </p><p>The very infectious nature of the COVID-19 virus makes it difficult to prevent and control in residential care settings - an experience replicated internationally. Interrupting transmission of the COVID-19 virus is the main goal of public health measures and it is clear from our experience that the scale of effect of interruption of transmission is influenced by a number of factors. The most important way to protect our older population, whether living at home or in a LTRC setting, has been to reduce the amount of disease present in our community. If we can keep the rate of disease low this means that we protect both the staff and residents in LTRC. The transmission of the virus, particularly in respect of LTRCs is multifactorial and its introduction into any setting could be the result of a number of factors, including it being introduced unknowingly by asymptomatic residents or staff.  This is why the substantial package of published guidance continues to evolve and be updated in line with new national and international evidence and guidance. Regular research is undertaken of national and international literature to ensure that the best available information and evidence is considered in this rapidly evolving environment.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organization, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-Covid care including more routine care</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput. The HSE is currently engaging with hospital groups to assess the impact of these guidelines on activity. The completion of this work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints, including paediatric appointments and procedures. </p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to provide services in a different way, which includes virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) is amongst those hospitals that are engaging in the use of telehealth and virtual clinics to facilitate outpatient appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (<i></i>).</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, including paediatric waiting lists, with a view to informing activity going forward.

Services have benefited from significant additional investment over recent years, which has resulted in an overall provision of &euro;1.026 billion for HSE Mental Health this year. This represents an increase of &euro;315m since 2012, and an increase of &euro;39m over 2019. The additional &euro;39m includes &euro;13m for the continued rollout of new developments this year. </p><p>There are currently 71 Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) teams, 4 CAMHS inpatient units and 3 Paediatric Liaison Teams. Approximately 18,000 children were expected to be referred to the HSE CAMHS service this year, with around 11,000 expected to be seen by CAMHS professionals. In each region, individual cases professionally assessed as requiring urgent access to CAMHS received priority.</p><p>The HSE Service Plan 2020 aims to improve all aspects of mental health care, including the development of CAMHS inpatient and community-based services and their integration with Primary Care and increased access to talk therapies for young people. A new forensic CAMHS unit, the first of its kind nationally, has been built at the new National Forensic Mental Health complex at Portrane. This will provide specialist CAMHS care not previously available within our system. </p><p>The Department of Health has worked with the HSE to develop various e-Mental Health responses for CAMHS and other youth services. Approval was recently announced for the new <i>CAMHS Connect</i>service for the HSE West region, which will pave the way for a national roll-out of such a new system. The need for such an approach, and how we plan and deliver our mental health services overall in the future, has been highlighted by Covid-19 and has been prioritised by Government responses to date.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE, in collaboration with key cross-Government and cross-sectoral partners, has developed a new mental wellbeing campaign. This campaign, hosted on <i>gov.ie/together</i>, offers support and resources to help deal with stress, anxiety and isolation currently experienced by many people, including young people.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE will continue to work closely with the Department of Education to advise on enhanced mental health supports for young people. Detailed information in relation to the Leaving Certificate is available at <i></i>. </p><p>This site contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students. It includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty, managing stress and anxiety, and has been developed by the National Educational Psychological Service. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. The Department of Health has worked with the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students. </p><p>The Government is satisfied that CAMHS and other youth mental health services are adequately resourced at this time but we will continue to keep the issues raised by the Deputy under close review. </p></reply>

A testing and tracing process with sufficient capacity and quick turnaround is one of a number of core criteria in determining when it is safe for countries to reduce restrictive public health measures. </p>  <p>  The HSE, together with the Department of Health and other bodies, has worked hard in the last two months to develop Ireland&rsquo;s testing and tracing process, to expand capacity and to reduce turnaround times. </p>  <p>  A designated team, led by a senior manager reporting directly to the CEO, has been established in the HSE to oversee the development, management and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s testing and contact tracing process. This includes responsibility for the scaling up of capacity and the speeding up of turnaround times with a clear focus on achieving ambitious targets and continuous improvement. On 14 May the HSE launched its Roadmap for testing and tracing with clear targets and a range of actions to achieve these targets.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made over the last two months. 47 community testing centres have been established; over 40 laboratories are processing tests; 9 new contact tracing centres have been set up and some 1,700 public servants have been trained in contact tracing to support the work of public health departments. A quick testing referral pathway for GPs is in place, and new IT systems have been developed or modified. The HSE advise that it now has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day and median turnaround times have continued to improve.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise these systems and capacity have been developed from a standing start and to recognise the tremendous work which has gone into getting us to the point we are now at. It is also important to recognise the context in which this is happening: Ireland is already testing at a higher rate than most countries and our targets are ambitious. Data published on 18 May shows Ireland ranks 4th highest out of 25 EU+UK countries in terms of tests completed as a percentage of the overall population.</p>  <p>  Ireland's testing strategy has evolved as our testing capacity has grown. A number of changes have been made to the case definition so that anyone presenting with acute respiratory infection comprising the sudden onset of least one of the following symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) can be referred for testing. A mass testing programme across nursing homes, mental health and disability facilities is nearing completion, and, as of last week, all close contacts of someone with Covid-19 will be automatically referred for testing. Our testing strategy will continue to be kept under review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question raised, I have not had any direct engagement with the person referred to and I'm not aware of any engagement with my officials. </p></reply>

The period  from early March to mid-April saw an increase in the number of such discharged  patients  as the health system prepared itself for the expected &lsquo;surge&rsquo;  in  COVID-19  cases.  From  an  older  person&rsquo;s perspective, being admitted  for  longer  than  necessary  increases  the  risk  of  a patient contracting  a  healthcare  associated infection and/or deconditioning. The vast  majority  of these discharges took place from the 10th March onwards, when clear public health guidance was in place.</p>  <p>  On the 10th March 2020, the HSE issued Interim Guidance on Transfer between Care  Facilities,  which  included  preliminary guidance on the transfer of hospitalised patients from an acute hospital to a residential care facility in  the  context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The guidance based on the best available information at the time set out the various procedures to be followed, including:</p>  <p>  - Patients with COVID-19 should not be transferred to a LTRC until they had two consecutive tests indicating virus not detected.</p>  <p>  - Patients  who  were  symptomatic  and  were  contacts of a confirmed COVID-19  case  should  only  transfer  if  the  persons  had  a test indicating  virus not detected and it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;</p>  <p>  - Patients  who  were  asymptomatic  and  were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;</p>  <p>  - Transfers  from  hospitals  with  no  evidence of spread of COVID-19 should  proceed  as  normal,  except  patients with respiratory tract infection  meeting  the then criteria for COVID-19 testing &ndash; in those cases  testing  should  be carried out and the result should be virus not-detected before transfer.</p>  <p>  With regard to the query raised in respect of numbers of patients, this data is not readily available to my Department but I will follow up with the HSE to seek further information.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

As part of the whole-of-government direct provision support system the Department of Justice and Equality provides accommodation, food and utilities to those seeking international protection in Ireland. The Department of Health and the HSE provide for the health care of applicants.   </p>  <p>  With the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis , the HSE prepared guidance for Homeless and other vulnerable group settings including Direct Provision settings, which can be found on www.hpsc.ie. This guidance is kept under review and updated as required.  The guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.   </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE have worked closely together to ensure that the health and welfare of asylum seekers and refugees availing of the State&rsquo;s accommodation services are protected. In all matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health advice from the HSE and the National Public Health Emergency Team is followed. </p>  <p>  The HSE has put in place a range of measures to support Accommodation Centres operated by the Department of Justice and Equality to prevent and control Covid-19 issues in centres and to address any cases of COVID-19 if or when they arise.  This includes provision for offsite self-isolation centres around the State.   </p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE continue to work closely together to support the health and welfare of international protection applicants availing of the State&rsquo;s accommodation services, including during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Both the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE are committed to protecting the identity and medical confidentiality of residents, as required by law. For this reason, neither the Department nor the HSE will give specific information about individuals or locations. The health authorities will only comment on cases or outbreaks of any illness (Covid-19 or otherwise) if there is a Public Health reason to do so.   The operational matters referred to are a matter for the HSE and I have referred the question to the HSE for response and direct reply.</p></reply>

I was very clear at that time, and during the debates in the House of the Oireachtas, that it was essential that we did not continue to allow women to put their lives at risk through the use of unregulated, unsafe medications without medical supervision. </p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution noted in its report that there was evidence of abortifacient medications being bought on the internet and used by women in this country without medical supervision. During its meetings, as the Deputy will be aware, the Joint Committee heard evidence from on the issue. Dr Abigail Aiken of the University of Texas gave evidence on research she conducted which indicated that between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2015, 5650 women in Ireland requested medical termination of pregnancy through the online telemedicine service Women on Web. Dr Aiken also presented evidence on research she conducted on 1023 women from Ireland who completed terminations after they received medication from Women on Web between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2012. Dr Aiken noted that her research included women from both this jurisdiction and from Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition, there was evidence of abortifacient medications being bought online and imported into Ireland from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). The HPRA is the competent authority responsible for the regulation of human medicines in Ireland; it employs enforcement actions, in cooperation with the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to identify the unauthorised supply of prescription-only medicines, including those containing abortifacients, to the public. The HPRA publishes figures each year on seizures of illegally imported medicines; in 2017, HPRA figures indicated that it detained 740 tablets containing misoprostal or mifepristone, while in 2016, 536 such tablets were detained.  </p></reply>

The HPSC published updated guidance on the use of surgical face masks on 22 April and is now advising that surgical masks should be worn by healthcare workers, including home support workers. Updated guidance for health and social care workers who visit homes was published on the HPSC website on 24 April. This is available at www.hspc.ie  and advice for family carers is available on the website of Family Carers Ireland .</p><p>In relation to nursing homes, PPE is distributed by the HSE via a centralised request management system that services relevant healthcare settings, including hospitals, nursing homes (public and private), National Ambulance Service, GPs, and all Section 38 and 39 service providers. In line with NPHET recommendations all nursing homes have equality of access to PPE with all other services in line with clinical guidance. This centralised approach is in line with WHO guidance on coordinating PPE supply; WHO guidance also emphasises the need to ensure rational and appropriate use of PPE in view of the global shortage of such equipment.</p></reply>

This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices for the first time, including altruistic domestic surrogacy.  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the bill is ongoing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  It is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the publication of the Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, the Deputy should be aware that I consider the progression of this legislation to be a priority. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the provisions within the General Scheme do not include the regulation of Irish citizens involved in international commercial surrogacy agreements in other countries.  The Department of Justice and Equality published a guidance document in 2012 on citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State.  The purpose of this document is to provide information to prospective intending parents on the steps necessary to ensure that a child born abroad through a surrogacy arrangement may enter and reside in the State and to secure the best interests of the child.  This guidance document is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p>  <p>  However, there are clearly additional challenges arising from the global travel restrictions currently imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which can impact upon individuals who have engaged in international surrogacy.  Issues relating to overseas travel are matters for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and I understand that his officials have been actively assisting and advising Irish citizens who find themselves, in the current circumstances, being prevented from, or experiencing difficulty in, travelling to and from this jurisdiction, and/or entering and exiting another jurisdiction. </p></reply>

As such, the IBTS has advised that it must be viewed as a marker of higher sexual risk-taking, which in a blood donor could pose an increased risk to the blood supply and to blood recipients.  Accordingly, under the IBTS blood deferral policy, individuals who have ever had gonorrhoea are permanently excluded from donating blood.</p><p>The only data available to the IBTS for comparison was from the UK, who currently have a 12 month deferral policy in place for individuals who have completed treatment for Gonorrhoea.</p><p>The IBTS will continue to keep all deferral policies under active review in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international experience.</p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>Guidance in relation to business activities in specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector. </p></reply>

Discharges to nursing homes and other settings are a regular, daily feature of a functioning health system. The period from early March to mid-April saw an increase in the number of such discharged patients as the health system prepared itself for the expected &lsquo;surge&rsquo; in COVID-19 cases. From an older person&rsquo;s perspective, being admitted for longer than necessary increases the risk of a patient contracting a healthcare associated infection and/or deconditioning. The vast majority of these discharges took place from the 10th March onwards, when clear public health guidance was in place. </p><p>On the 10<sup>th</sup>March 2020, the HSE issued Interim Guidance on Transfer between Care Facilities, which included preliminary guidance on the transfer of hospitalised patients from an acute hospital to a residential care facility in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The guidance based on the best available information at the time set out the various procedures to be followed, including:</p><p>- Patients with COVID-19 should not be transferred to a LTRC until they had two consecutive tests indicating virus not detected.</p><p>- Patients who were symptomatic and were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if the persons had a test indicating virus not detected and it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;</p><p>- Patients who were asymptomatic and were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period;</p><p>- Transfers from hospitals with no evidence of spread of COVID-19 should proceed as normal, except patients with respiratory tract infection meeting the then criteria for COVID-19 testing &ndash; in those cases testing should be carried out and the result should be virus not-detected before transfer.</p><p>With regard to the query raised in respect of numbers of positive cases, this data is not readily available to my Department but I will follow up with the HSE to seek further information.  </p></reply>

The rights, welfare and best interests of children is fundamental to the legislation.</p>  <p>  The recent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 (as amended) on 4 May will, for the first time, provide a legal framework for registering the births of children who are born as a result of assisted human reproduction involving donated eggs or sperm or embryos. The legislation also requires donor details to be stored through the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register. This will enable children to access information on their donor should they so wish thus enabling them to exercise their rights to know their genetic identity. </p>  <p>  Commencement of Parts 2&amp;3 also entitles parents of children born in the State as a result of a donor assisted reproduction procedure performed before the 4th of May to apply to the courts for legal recognition of their parental status, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Following commencement, the legislation prohibits the use of non-anonymous gametes in most circumstances, embedding the rights of children to know their genetic heritage in future years.  </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties the global Covid pandemic has presented for donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  It has led to the closure of fertility clinics for several weeks and some individuals and couples have found themselves in a position where they can no longer use gametes they had previously purchased.  </p>  <p>  However, it is now over 5 years since the Children and Family Relationships Act was enacted and while I had intended to commence Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 last summer I allowed a longer lead time to for people to make arrangements to use gametes that have already been purchased, where appropriate, and to allow a sufficient pool of donors with the appropriate consent to be acquired  in advance of commencement of Parts 2&amp;3.</p>  <p>  Further delay to the commencement of Parts 2&amp;3 would have presented an unfair penalty to those parents who have already waited a substantial period of time to have their rights to parentage vindicated in law and most importantly for the State to vindicate the rights of donor conceived persons to information about their genetic identity.</p></reply>

In some instances, the HSE itself delivers these services directly and in other circumstances, the HSE relies upon funded providers to deliver these services on its behalf.   Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 legally underpin </p>  <p>  (a) the provision of services by non-statutory providers on behalf of the HSE (Section 38); and</p>  <p>  (b) the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide (Section 39).  </p>  <p>  Amongst Section 39 voluntary organisations are hospices, mental health providers, nursing home and homecare providers, small community-based groups and social care services.     In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, each HSE Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) has an Area Crisis Management Team and all services have plans in place for providing supports during this period to ensure continuity of service provision.  The HSE holds weekly teleconferences with key stakeholders, including Section 39 service providers, to identify and respond to challenges at local level, </p>  <p>  As part of the HSE COVID 19 response, there is a requirement on each of the Area Crisis ManagementTeams to establish a number of Residential Care &amp;amp; Home Support Covid-19 Response Teams (CRT)to address COVID -19 outbreaks in their area. The purpose of these CRTs is to support the prevention, identification, and management of COVID 19 outbreaks across residential care facilities and Home Support services. These teams provide support across a range of nursing and medical care areas as well as Infection Prevention and Control. The teams also support residential care facilities/Approved centres in the catchment area whether they are public, Section 38, Section 39 or private facilities, and across the care groups of Older People, Disability, &amp;amp; Mental Health. In addition, they also address identified clusters of concern in the Home Support services, as determined by Public Health. </p>  <p>  The HSE has put in place a structured governance process through which Section 39 organisations experiencing financial difficulties due to the Covid-19 public health emergency can engage to ensure, where appropriate, continuity of essential services provided by these agencies.  </p>  <p>  Finally I would like to acknowledge the vital role played by voluntary organisations, including those funded by the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act, in ensuring a flexible and person-centred response to ensure continued support for our most vulnerable citizens during this challenging period, and as we prepare for the next phase of the response.  </p></reply>

In this context, the HSE are in the process of detailed planning in order to recover these services in line with the Governments' Roadmap.  This will be supported by way of assurance and oversight from the HSE's Chief Clinical Officer along with the NPHET, to ensure the HSE does so in a safe manner. HSE will continue to adhere to public health requirements while also reflecting key policy and legal requirements forming under the UN Convention on the Rights of People with a Disability. This means that services, whilst being delivered in new ways, will gradually be re-introduced to people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The HSE have established a number of Working Groups to design and propose how services can be safely reintroduced. This will be achieved as a collaborative process involving out colleagues within the disability umbrella organisations. </p>  <p>  Please note that many educational services for children with disabilities are under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills and the deputy may wish to direct enquiries in that regard to my colleague, the Minister for Education.</p></reply>

On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

People living in Long-term Residential Care facilities are particularly vulnerable populations in the context of Covid-19 and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to infection from this disease and for subsequent adverse outcomes.</p><p>This is most likely due to their age, the high prevalence of underlying medical conditions and circumstances where high care support with the activities of daily living is required in collective high physical contact environments. These are characteristics of LTRC in Ireland that make them a high-risk centre for Covid-19 outbreak and contagion across residents and staff. The approach by Government has been public health led in line with data, evidence and best practice as it emerges, through advice from the NPHET. The response to COVID-19 in LTRC is based on preparedness, early recognition, isolation, care and prevention of onward spread. This involves case recognition, testing, contact tracing and examining disease patterns including mortality. The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support nursing homes and their residents have been taken, and have evolved on foot of, epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). These measures have been both society wide (e.g. cocooning), as well as focused specifically on residential facilities.</p><p>The scope of LTRC covers older people, disability and mental health residential care settings. LTRC facilities provide long-term care and short stay, transitional care and respite support either through the State, the voluntary sector or privately. On 10th March 2020 Interim Guidance on Transfer between Care Facilities was circulated and through HIQA was circulated directly to all LTRC registered centres. On the 11th March 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and the following day the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) published its 6th update to its Rapid Risk Assessment (RRA), 12th March 2020, including new guidance in relation to the implementation of social distancing measures and prevention and control priorities in relation to inter alia LTRCs.  On the same day as the ECDC update, NPHET recommended that Ireland move to &ldquo;delay phase&rdquo; and social distancing measures were recommended and announced, including:</p><p>-  Visiting restrictions in long-term care facilities;</p><p>-  Individuals who have symptoms should self-isolate for a period of 14 days;</p><p>-  Staggered breaks in work and greater remote working etc.</p><p>The Government's COVID-19 Action Plan was published on 16th March 2020 and included key actions relating to the protection of vulnerable groups in community settings, including long-term care settings, through maintenance of existing services and enhanced support actions.</p><p>Preliminary Clinical and Infection Control Guidance for COVID-19 in nurse-led Residential Care Facilities (RCF) was published by the HSE and circulated to the nursing homes sector on 17th March 2020. The document provides guidance on general measures to reduce the risk of accidental introduction of COVID-19 into a LTRC, procedures to be followed for clinically suspect residents; guidance on clinical investigations and monitoring and on IPC. The document also provides detailed step-by-step instructions across a range of scenarios.</p><p>As the disease has progressed, a range of enhanced measures for nursing homes have been recommended by NPHET which are now being implemented by relevant agencies.</p><p>Each HSE CHO Area Crisis Management Team (ACMT) has prioritised the needs of all long-term care residents within their areas and has also offered very significant support to the nursing homes in their areas, particularly those with COVID 19 outbreaks. Guidance on the set up of COVID Response Teams was issued on 9th April to support all LTRCs within a CHO area and 23 COVID Response Teams are now in place across the 9 CHO areas. These teams are actively supporting all centres with outbreaks in their area through operational guidance and infection prevention and control (IPC) and Clinical support by Geriatricians etc, and in the most at-risk centres, staff are being deployed or sourced to ensure ongoing safe service delivery. </p><p>The establishment and provision of accommodation supports for staff who are living in congregated arrangements has been implemented with approximately 2,000 beds occupied per week.</p><p>To support designated centres HIQA set up an Infection Prevention and Control Hub providing support to providers and staff via email and phone. This support, guidance and advice includes:</p><p>-  outbreak preparedness</p><p>-  outbreak management advice (for example, resident placement, cohorting and special measures where isolations is not possible, transmission and standard precautions)</p><p>-  understanding HSE advice and its applicability to specific centres </p><p>-  general support on infection control issues.</p><p>Overall a significant package of measures has been adopted to date, including:</p><p>-  HSE COVID Response Teams across the Community Health Organisations, to provide support and expert guidance to all long-term care residential settings;</p><p>-  The provision of staffing, PPE, Oxygen, training and other supports to nursing homes;</p><p>-  The &euro;72.5m COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme;</p><p>-  A Mortality census;</p><p>-  HIQA risk assessment of all nursing homes;</p><p>-  HIQA regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID19 outbreak;</p><p>-  Health Protection Surveillance Centre guidance;</p></reply>

On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. </p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET.  The HSE advise that the latest occupancy data for inpatients in private hospitals indicates that overall in-patient occupancy has increased to 51%.</p>  <p>   The HSE advise that preliminary figures show that as of 25th May, 7,605 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force. In the same period 26,007 daycase procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 35,073 diagnostic appointments and 20,407 outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  Under the terms agreed with the hospitals, provision has been made to ensure continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or receiving a course of treatment when the arrangement was agreed. These patients will be treated as public patients and will be prioritised based on clinical needs, as with any other public patient. It is intended that each patient will remain under the care of their existing consultant, where that can be facilitated and if that is not possible, they will be transferred to the care of another consultant as a public patient. </p></reply>

Discharges to nursing homes and other settings are a regular, daily feature of a functioning health system. The period from early March to mid-April saw an increase in the number of such discharged patients as the health system prepared itself for the expected &lsquo;surge&rsquo; in COVID-19 cases. From an older person&rsquo;s perspective, being admitted for longer than necessary increases the risk of a patient contracting a healthcare associated infection and/or deconditioning. The vast majority of these discharges took place from the 10th March onwards, when clear public health guidance was in place. </p><p>On the 10<sup>th</sup>March 2020, the HSE issued Interim Guidance on Transfer between Care Facilities, which included preliminary guidance on the transfer of hospitalised patients from an acute hospital to a residential care facility in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The guidance based on the best available information at the time set out the various procedures to be followed, including: </p><p>- Patients with COVID-19 should not be transferred to a LTRC until they had two consecutive tests indicating virus not detected. </p><p>- Patients who were symptomatic and were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if the persons had a test indicating virus not detected and it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period; </p><p>- Patients who were asymptomatic and were contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case should only transfer if it was possible for that person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period; </p><p>- Transfers from hospitals with no evidence of spread of COVID-19 should proceed as normal, except patients with respiratory tract infection meeting the then criteria for COVID-19 testing &ndash; in those cases testing should be carried out and the result should be virus not-detected before transfer. </p><p>With regard to the query raised in respect of numbers of patients, this data is not readily available to my Department but I will follow up with the HSE to seek further information.  </p></reply>

The GMS contract stipulates that GPs must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum/deputy, for urgent cases outside normal practice hours. Most GPs choose to participate in GP out of hours cooperatives to meet this contractual obligation.  </p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, patient in-person contact with GPs has been curtailed as much as possible to help prevent the spread of the virus. Nurse and doctor advice is provided over the phone where appropriate, and only patients who are clinically assessed as requiring a face to face consultation with a doctor are referred for an appointment. </p>  <p>  GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for medical services provided to medical card or GP visit card holders, while patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis, and the fees charged by GPs for services to private patients are a matter of private contract between the GP and their patients. </p>  <p>  Similarly, cooperatives that provide out of hour GP services are private companies and therefore the fees charged to their private patients are a matter of private contract between the company and their patients.

The primary responsibility of managing the risk of infection with Covid-19 and for control of outbreaks lies with the residential care facility, within their responsibilities for resident care and infection control.  This responsibility is referred to in the 2016 National Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland. </p><p>  Appropriate evidence-based guidance to support the work of health and social care providers on a range of issues, including infection prevention and control, has been developed by the HSE and the HPSC and is updated regularly, as appropriate, and made available on their websites. On 5th May, the HPSC published Interim Public Health and Infection Prevention Control Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of Covid-19 Cases and Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities and Similar Units.  These are available on the HPSC website.</p><p>  This guidance provides the most up to date advice and information on the public health management and infection prevention and control measures, to inform and advise local planning and management in community residential facilities.  </p><p>The Taoiseach recently announced a Roadmap for the future easing of restrictions on a phased basis. Phase 3, from 29 June, will see the commencement of a phased approach to visiting at hospitals, residential healthcare centre and other residential settings bearing in mind the particular features of types of settings and each individual centre, also considering Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) availability and other protections.</p><p>All nursing homes, public and private continue to be regulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and have a duty to ensure continued adherence to the existing regulatory and standards framework in the discharge of their duties.</p></reply>

Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications that will impact on throughput.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working to develop a continuity of services plan to examine how healthcare activity suspended during Covid-19 can be resumed while maintaining acute occupancy at 80% to provide for surge capacity in the event of a further wave of Covid-19. This work should enable non-urgent elective care to resume within the necessary constraints.</p>  <p>  The key to maintaining reduced acute hospital occupancy is to address the gap between capacity and demand as set out in the Health Service Capacity Review 2018. The HSE has advised that plans to address the findings of the capacity review are currently being revised in response to the emerging and potential long-term impact of Covid-19, and my Department is continuing to engage with the HSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Government published its Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 on 16 March. A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential additional acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. The terms of the arrangement reflected the expected Covid-19 pandemic at time of signing. It is in place for three months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Terms to the agreement a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month. The arrangement is currently under review and depending on the outcome a decision will be made on whether to extend or not. Any decision regarding an extension would have to be considered in the context of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the most effective use of resources in tackling it. Therefore, while there is an option to extend the arrangement, it is not intended that the arrangement will be permanent.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to address the supply of  fish to market so as to better balance the supply of fish from these vessels to the available market demand for these fish. The Scheme will be operational from 1 June and will allow vessel owners of fishing vessels to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months over the period June to August.  </p><p>The Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres, to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length.  More details available at the following link</p><p>www.agriculture.gov.ie/press/pressreleases/2020/may/title,142520,en.html.</p><p>The Scheme is implemented under article 33 of the EMFF Regulation (508/2014) which allows aid to fishing vessels only for temporary cessation of fishing activities.  Vessels in the aquaculture segment of the fleet are not included in the scope of the Regulation and, accordingly, their inclusion in the Tie-up Scheme is precluded.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.1844.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700145#WRRR01600"><p>In February 2018, I announced that vaccination of badgers against tuberculosis (TB) had commenced as an integral part of the bovine TB eradication programme.  Vaccination would commence in areas where successful field trials had already taken place with a view to gradually rolling it out to other parts of the country over time.  As I stated then, my view is that this marks a major step forward in the bovine TB eradication programme, enabling Ireland to work towards the eradication of bovine TB in a controlled holistic way, which will serve to protect the badger population whilst also protecting cattle and the livelihoods of farmers.</p><p>The Deputy should be aware, however, that some level of badger culling in response to severe TB episodes will still be required.  Badger culling contributed significantly to the very considerable improvement in the disease situation nationally in recent years.  However, culling of badgers is not sustainable in the long term given its ultimate impact on badger ecology and Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Berne convention. The vaccination trials referred to, carried out between 2013 and 2017, took place following 15 years of research work using BCG vaccine to prevent tuberculosis infection in badgers.  The peer-reviewed published trials demonstrated that vaccination is no less effective than culling.  Badger vaccination will therefore represent a fundamental part of the TB Wildlife Programme and allow for a reduction in the numbers of badgers being culled over the coming years while still maintaining effective control of the risk posed to cattle.  </p><p>In 2019, vaccination Technical Team Co-ordinators were appointed by my Department and training of staff in all offices was also carried out.  The areas that were chosen in this first large extension of vaccination were those areas that had lower incidence of bovine TB and where the areas had been prepared for changeover to vaccination by lowering badger densities as a result of ongoing badger removal.  The result of this was that, in late 2019, most counties in the country had areas within them that changed over to vaccination.  The changeover in late 2019 represented an increase of the area subject to vaccination increasing from 7,887km<sup>2</sup>to 17,748km<sup>2</sup>and it is intended to continue to increase the area under vaccination in the coming years.</p><p>Recent IT improvements now allow for every badger in the vaccination area to be recorded electronically when and where it is captured and vaccinated.  Currently, approximately 70% of badgers being captured in vaccination areas are new captures and have not been vaccinated previously.  This is expected to fall over time as greater population penetration is achieved.  Of the 1,870 badgers that were captured in the vaccination area last year, 1,391 were vaccinated with BCG, 42 were removed for epidemiological reasons, 434 had been previously vaccinated and 3 were euthanized for health reasons. Badger vaccination efforts vary from region to region at different times of the year based on disease risk and disease priorities.</p><p>The numbers of badgers vaccinated by County for 2019 and for the first six weeks of 2020 are set out in the following table.  More up todate numbers will be available shortly. </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>WUS 2019 Vaccination</th>       <th>WUS 2020 Vaccination - First 6 weeks</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>131</td>       <td>62</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>320</td>       <td>78</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>155</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>189</td>       <td>38</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>41</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Precise information related to the numbers of badgers vaccinated by county for 2018 are not available as the only areas in the vaccination zones in 2018 were the former vaccination trial areas. Vaccination of badgers in 2018 continued at the levels experienced during the trials, i.e. at a rate of approximately 1,000 per year.  This is in comparison to the default procedure of removing badgers which continued at approximately 6,000 badgers per year but which reduced last year to 5,352 as badger vaccination increased.</p><p>The 2018 End of Year Report for the Department&rsquo;s Wildlife Unit is available at:</p><p>www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrols/tuberculosistbandbrucellosis/tbforum/2018NPWSEndofYearReport090819.pdf.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides 100% of establishment grants with annual premiums for up to 15 years, depending on the species chosen.  Landowners considering forestry should contact a registered forester who will complete the application on their behalf.  Further information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, including rates payable and a list of registered foresters.</p>  <p>  A wide variety of schemes are specifically focussed on  the establishment and management of forests that deliver significant biodiversity benefits. The Native Woodland Establishment Scheme supports the planting of new native woodland and the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme aims to conserve existing native woodland and help to convert conifer stands to native woodland at key locations. In addition, the Woodland Environmental Fund, launched in 2018, encourages businesses to get involved in encouraging private landowners to take up the Native Woodland Establishment Scheme. Business provide a &lsquo;top up&rsquo; payment of &euro;1,000/ha to the landowner as a further incentive to convert from agriculture to native woodland. So far, Microsoft, Aldi, Lidl, An Post, Accenture and KBI Global Investment have participated in the fund. </p>  <p>  Support measures for the sustainable management of forests, with the added benefit of increasing biodiversity, are also funded by my Department. The Continuous Cover Forestry scheme redirects plantations away from the 'normal' clear fell / reforestation model and into continuous cover forestry. As trees are felled singly or in small groups (typically with smaller machinery) and the gaps left are planted up or fill in with natural regeneration, the overall canopy cover is left intact, protecting the soil and the woodland ecosystem. The  Woodland Improvement Thinning and Tending Scheme for broadleaves aims to improve the quality and value of retained trees by removing poorer quality stems and redirecting growth onto better quality ones. This delivers a biodiversity benefit as it will open up the canopy and allow increased levels of light infiltration onto the forest floor, encouraging ground vegetation and the scrub understory. This increase in habitat biodiversity leads to more insects and birds in these more diverse habitats. Protection of this grounded vegetation and scrub layer is further supported by the  Deer Fencing Scheme. Excluding deer also allows the natural regeneration of trees and scrubs, as seed falling onto the site can germinate and become established, which increases the woodland biodiversity generally.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the important role bees play within agriculture and for biodiversity as both pollinators and honey producers, by providing a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the beekeeping associations.</p>  <p>  Support to the beekeeping sector in Ireland is provided through the National Apiculture Programme, which provides funding to carry out applied research for the Irish apiculture sector.  The Commercial Horticulture grant aid scheme provides grant aid towards capital investments in specialised beekeeping equipment and also contributes annual grants to Irish National Beekeepers associations to help their associated members and branches to pursue the craft of beekeeping to the highest standards and to also inform the general public about the environmental role that bees play in maintaining Irish biodiversity and crop production. Owners of native woodland  are also encouraged to contact local bee-keepers and to offer to 'host-a-hive' within their woodland. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.1869.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700145#WRRR04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 and 663 together.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary objective for the fishing sector throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic has been to maintain fishing activity in  order to ensure critical food supply lines to the domestic and European markets. For this reason, from the outset the Government classified fishing as an essential service and kept the fishery harbours and related support services open throughout the Pandemic. This remains the primary Government objective in relation to the fishing sector.</p>  <p>  There has been significant and sustained offshore fishing activity by the Irish fleet over the past three months. This has been helped by the fact that the price of oil, a critical cost factor for the fleet, has reduced dramatically. Together with good fishing weather, these factors have greatly assisted the viability of fishing operations, notwithstanding reduced market prices for fish.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie up Scheme is simply designed as a safety net scheme to provide a further option to fishermen who choose not to continue fishing. It is not designed as a replacement for viable fishing activity, wherever those possibilities exist. To date, most Irish offshore fishing vessels have continued to fish. As European and Asian markets gradually begin to open up, as is happening at present, it is likely that demand and prices will continue to improve and, in those circumstances, many fishermen will continue to choose to fish and not to avail of the scheme. The Temporary Tie up Scheme, as a safety net scheme, is not designed to attract all fishermen or to bring all fishing activity to a halt. </p>  <p>  Fishermen have been and will continue to be able to avail of the horizontal Government Covid-19 supports, such as the Pandemic Unemployment Benefit, the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the banking arrangements. Those horizontal supports continue to be available to the fishing sector and the Temporary Tie up Scheme is a further complementary and additional support to fishermen who choose not to continue fishing. The Scheme is not intended as an income replacement scheme for fishing vessel owners. The Scheme is intended to contribute towards the fixed costs associated with fishing vessels of various sizes that voluntarily choose to tie-up. The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length. Those support levels are in line with the fixed costs reported by the fleet to BIM through the EU Data Collection Framework.</p>  <p>  It is up to each fishing vessel owner to decide whether to tie-up for a month or two or to keep fishing and in line with the Government policy of keeping the food chain operating. It is, of course, preferable that the supply of fish continues to satisfy available markets.</p>  <p>  In general, fishing vessel owners want their vessels to be at sea and fishing. The Scheme was capped at a maximum of 66% of each vessel size category in the fleet to ensure a continued level of fishing activity.  To assist the continuation of fishing activity over the coming period, generous vessel quota allocations are being made for the month of June.</p></reply>

The afforestation scheme offers a fixed grant towards the costs, subject to the maximum laid down in the scheme&rsquo;s terms and conditions. In addition, annual premiums are payable to new forests which qualify for an afforestation grant for a maximum period of 15 years.</p><p>There is no distinction between the rate paid to farmers and non-farmers under the 2014-2020 Forestry Programme as the aim is to make the afforestation scheme accessible to all landowners.  However, the table below shows that overwhelmingly, forestry premiums are paid to farmers.</p><p>The following table shows the number of farmer/non-farmers in each county, the amount of premiums received in 2019 and the percentage of premiums paid to farmers/non-farmers. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Total No. Applicants</th>       <th>Total Premiums  Paid 2019</th>

They also participate in cross-Departmental mechanisms to ensure that appropriate and effective supports are available to all businesses.</p>  <p>  With regard to the challenges currently faced by agri food businesses, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period. All the banks have announced that they will offer flexibility to their customers, and that they may be able to provide payment breaks or emergency working capital facilities. The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cashflow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. This includes the National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme, encompassing both the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  The &euro;250 million SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, co-financed by my Department, has also been deployed to address liquidity and financing needs of eligible businesses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  For smaller businesses of less than 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland are also offering a COVID-19 Business Loan, providing working capital loans up to &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS), also co-financed by my Department, was launched last year and made &euro;300m of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses. Loans are competitively priced, for terms of 8-10 years, and support strategic long-term investment. As a result of the significant and sudden financial impact of the pandemic on businesses a second tranche, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector, will be made available through the banks, with details to be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government have announced agreement of a further suite of measures to further support business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19. Work has commenced on a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs, including agri-businesses, farmers and fishers, for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates. Other measures include a &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019; a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses; and the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading, during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with stakeholders across the sector in relation to the impact of this crisis and the Government will continue to keep the needs of the whole agri-food sector under review as the situation evolves. </p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulations articles.</p>  <p>  In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website www.hpra.ie.</p>  <p>  The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.</p>  <p>  In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to stock them in the future but from January 2022 onwards, a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products and plan to have a public consultation in Q2 2020. A dedicated email address has been set up for this purpose and I would encourage all interested parties to send their  observations to vetmedregs@agriculture.gov.ie. </p></reply>

Ineligible features, e.g. scrub, rock, etc., are not eligible and must be deducted from the area being declared for payment. Furthermore, land that is abandoned, i.e. no agriculture activity taking place, is not considered as eligible land. Lands designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), Special Protected Areas (SPA) or Natural Heritage Areas can be considered as eligible land for payment purposes subject to the land meeting these conditions. </p><p>There is further provision under Article 32 of Regulation 1307/2013, which provides that where lands designated as SAC or SPA develop ineligible features as a result of the requirements of such designation, the land may be considered eligible for payment, subject to additional conditions, i.e. the land must have been claimed and deemed eligible for payment under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme and any increase in the area of ineligible features must be directly linked to the management requirements of such designation. SAC or SPA land that is abandoned cannot be considered as eligible for payment under this provision.<b></b>Also, rock which is a hard feature can never be eligible for payment in these parcels.</p></reply>

On 31st March, my Department informed each licensed livestock mart that they could put in place alternative trade facilitation mechanisms that would support the orderly sale of animals necessary to support the essential business of farming. Any livestock mart wishing to engage in limited activities to facilitate the buying and selling of livestock was asked to submit for approval a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) demonstrating to the Department&rsquo;s satisfaction that the individual mart would be in a position to operate in full compliance with HSE guidelines in relation to hygiene and physical distancing. 80 of the 86 licensed marts submitted SOPs, and were approved to operate. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage constructively with marts and representative organisations. In recent weeks a lot of preparatory work has been done, so that when considered appropriate in the context of the broader approach to Covid-19, further activities in marts can be facilitated while continuing to ensure the safety of mart staff and clients.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the financial challenges currently faced by marts, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period. All the banks have announced that they will offer flexibility to their customers, and that they may be able to provide payment breaks or emergency working capital facilities. The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cash flow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. This includes the National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme, encompassing both the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The &euro;250 million SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, co-financed by my Department, has also been deployed to address liquidity and financing needs of eligible businesses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For smaller businesses of less than 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland is also offering a COVID-19 Business Loan, providing working capital loans up to &euro;50,000. The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS), also co-financed by my Department, was launched last year and made &euro;300m of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses. Loans are competitively priced, for terms of 8-10 years, and support strategic long-term investment. As a result of the significant and sudden financial impact of the pandemic on businesses a second tranche of &euro;200million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector, will be made available through the banks, with details to be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has announced agreement of a further suite of measures to further support businesses that are negatively impacted by Covid-19. Work has commenced on a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs, including agri-businesses, farmers and fishers, for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates. Other measures include a &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver/rebate from 2019; a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses; and the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading, during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p>  <p>  My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector. Senior officials from my Department remain in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves. </p></reply>

More than ever in the ongoing response to the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of this need for ongoing contact as the situation has evolved.  My Department and I are working to ensure that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that are necessary to protect farm incomes can continue. </p>  <p>  There are likely to be significant economic impacts for the agri-food sector, arising from reduced demand in key markets around the world.  The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.</p>  <p>  The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. These supports include Aids to Private Storage and Exceptional Aid measures, flexibilities when it comes to on-farm inspections and early payment of the Basic Payment Scheme. </p>  <p>  Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (SMP, Butter, Cheese), Beef and Sheepmeat.   Private Storage Aid (PSA) is a risk management tool/safety net available to EU producers of certain agricultural products under the CMO regulation (1308/2013). The aim is to facilitate producers to store the product for a stipulated temporary storage period. </p>  <p>  I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agri-food sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. </p>  <p>  My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector.

The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland with positive economic dividend on the farms concerned. Schemes such as the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) and Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme-Sucklers (BEEP-S) are focused on improving the carbon efficiency of the beef herd.</p>  <p>  My Department is progressing a draft roadmap called &lsquo;Agclimatise&rsquo; which aims to translate the targets in the National Climate Action Plan into more detailed actions with clear performance indicators. Actions proposed for the agricultural sector include: enhancing soil fertility and nutrient efficiency, promoting the use of protected nitrogen products, developing enhanced dairy and breeding programmes and developing a charter with animal feed manufacturers on the crude protein content of livestock. The pathway to delivery is challenging, and will require greater collaboration between farmers, industry, Government and other stakeholders to deliver on-farm impacts.</p>  <p>   I am confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets and its transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society, with collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility being key in achieving this ambition.</p></reply>

The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This will lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and to more sustainable fishing patterns.</p><p>An important aspect of the work to achieve and maintain MSY is to form a detailed picture of the biological status of the stocks of the stocks which are fished by our fleet. Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute with data from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2019, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. I have attached two tables (Tables 1 and 2) taken from the Stock Book that show the fluctuations of fish stocks over the last five years.</p><p>Of these 74 stocks, 35 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2019. This number has grown every year since 2013. The number of stocks being over-fished has declined from 22 in 2014 to 13 in 2019.  In the five year period referred to by the Deputy, the number of stocks fished sustainably has consistently increased, while those over fished have declined. These trends should ultimately lead to healthier fish stocks and higher quotas for Irish fishermen.</p><p>Fishing opportunities for each Member State are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. This, in turn, can lead to fluctuations in quotas, both increases and decreases.  At the negotiations for 2020 Total Allowable Catches and quotas, there were increases in a number of stocks of importance to Ireland such as Haddock, Monkfish and Megrim in the Celtic Sea. This outcome shows that the many years of intensive, industry-led conservation measures are paying off.  I am confident that, through the CFP, we will be able to ensure the sustainability of our fish stocks.  This will ensure the economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p><p>Fish stocks in inland waterways fall with the remit of the Department of Communication, Climate Action and the Environment and its agency Inland Fisheries Ireland. </p><p><b>Table 1</b>Summary of FEAS evaluation of fishing mortality in relation to FMSY for stocks of interest to Ireland. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th colspan="2">2015</th>       <th colspan="2">2016</th>       <th colspan="2">2017</th>       <th colspan="2">2018</th>       <th colspan="2">2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pressure status</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fished Below Fmsy</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>47</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fished Above Fmsy</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>F Unknown, Fmsy or not defined</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Number of Stocks</td>       <td></td>       <td>72</td>       <td></td>       <td>74</td>       <td></td>       <td>74</td>       <td></td>       <td>74</td>       <td></td>       <td>74</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2 Summary of FEAS evaluation of SSB in relation to biomass reference points for stocks of interest to Ireland. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th colspan="2">2015</th>       <th colspan="2">2016</th>       <th colspan="2">2017</th>       <th colspan="2">2018</th>       <th colspan="2">2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass status</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>       <td>Num</td>       <td>%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass above MSY Btrigger</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass below MSY Btrigger</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stock biomass Unknown or undefined </td>       <td>38</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>32</td>       <td>43</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>46</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Number of Stocks</td>       <td colspan="2">72</td>       <td colspan="2">74</td>       <td colspan="2">74</td>       <td colspan="2">74</td>       <td colspan="2">74</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. </p>  <p>  The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that  in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. As you know, my Department is the forestry licence consent authority and, since 2017, all licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences. It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.  In order to fully implement this system and to issue licences within accepted timescales, my Department is devoting extra resources to deliver these new procedures, as follows:  </p>  <p>  -  New forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff have been assigned to licensing. More forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020.</p>  <p>  -  Two new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with four more to be appointed shortly.</p>  <p>  -  We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contracted provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with five new ecologists is due to be signed very soon.</p>  <p>  -  Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.  </p>  <p>  -  Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p>  <p>  -  A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.</p>  <p>  To date in 2020, 719 tree felling licences have issued with a volume of 1.8 million m3.  In terms of afforestation licences processed, my Department has issued 248 afforestation licences for 1,859ha and 155 forest road works licences for 56km of forest roads, for the year to 22nd May 2020.  Furthermore, from January 2018 to the end of March 2020, there are valid afforestation licences for some 3,300ha that have not progressed to planting.  I would encourage landowners with valid afforestation licences to plant their land this year.  They will then access the premiums available under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I have an unwavering commitment to supporting the forestry sector and this commitment has been borne out during the current pandemic.  Forestry licensing has been deemed an essential service during the Covid-19 outbreak.  Officials of my Department have continued to work under restricted circumstances, to ensure that forestry licences and payments have issued daily during the health crisis. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

Department veterinary staff resources in meat plants are supplemented by a group of approximately 700 Temporary Veterinary Inspectors, who are Private Veterinary Practitioners contracted by the Department to deliver ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of animals and poultry in meat plants. A total of 149 meat premises are approved by my Department, with specific approvals for activities including slaughtering, deboning and/or cold storage of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Of these, DAFM has a &lsquo;permanent presence&rsquo; at the 49 premises which slaughter animals and carries out risk-based inspections and controls at the remaining approved meat premises.  </p>  <p>  In addition, 7 inspectorate and technical staff from my Department&rsquo;s Beef Carcase Classification Division monitor carcase classification in 38 beef and pig premises to ensure that it is in compliance with EU and Irish Legislation. </p>  <p>  In relation to inspections carried out by Departmental staff in connection with my Department&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities as outlined above, 406 veterinary inspections were carried out in DAFM approved meat plants in the first quarter of 2020. The number of inspections carried out in the second quarter will not be available until the end of that period. In addition, 208 carcase classification inspections by Beef Carcase Classification Division were carried out in the meat plants up to 22nd May 2020.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware, in the context of the pandemic, primary responsibility for public health policy and implementation rests with the Department of Health and the HSE.

Key Actions in the Climate Action Plan include: </p>  <p>  -  Commence the ESB Electric Vehicle High Power Charging Infrastructure Development Project, supported by the Climate Action Fund, which will support growth to at least 40,000 electric vehicles</p>  <p>  -  Include electric vehicle fast chargers as a category eligible for support in the next call for Expressions of Interest from Climate Action Fund</p>  <p>  -  Expand the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks) </p>  <p>  -  Carry out an updated needs analysis for fast chargers based on a level of 75,000 electric vehicles by 2022, taking into account market developments.</p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. ESB eCars will also contribute an additional &euro;10 million to support the roll out of this initiative. </p>  <p>  More than 50 high power charging hubs are being funded on motorway and national road sites. These hubs will be able to charge between two and eight vehicles simultaneously and are capable of providing up to 100 km of electric driving range in as little as six minutes. In addition to the high power charging hubs, up to 50 locations will also see Standard 22kW AC chargers upgraded to 50kW DC fast chargers, providing additional fast charging capacity around the country. </p>  <p>  Since the project began in September 2019, ESB has focused on the replacement of aging problematic chargers in the existing network which results in new charging points being established. Over 140 of these chargers have now been replaced and this work is continuing. In addition, two new multi charger sites were delivered, one each in Kilcullen, Kildare (M9) and the Galway Plaza (M6). These locations will be upgraded to include 150kW chargers once this type of charger is made available by the manufacturer with delivery expected in June following an extensive procurement process. </p>  <p>  Since October 2019 three Standard AC chargers have been replaced in County Cavan, with a further ten being replaced in Counties Meath (7) and Monaghan (3). </p>  <p>  In the last week with the easing of Covid 19 restrictions standard AC chargers in Kells and Cavan Town have been replaced with new DC Fast chargers, providing much higher charging speeds with further installations planned for Sligo Town, Drogheda, Galway City and Kenmare. </p>  <p>  There are currently two fast chargers and five Standard AC chargers in County Monaghan. Three of these have recently been replaced. No additional fast chargers are planned for Monaghan in the first stage of this project being rolled out by ESB eCars.</p>  <p>  More multi-fast charger sites are currently in the planning phase and will be delivered in the coming months. These sites are being selected based on a range of factors including the level of traffic, current charge point usage (if applicable), electrical grid capacity, site host terms of agreement, rest facilities available, accessibility and the physical space at the site for the required equipment. </p></reply>

The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to maximise their commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law. </p><p>An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations, this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016. Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position. However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law. Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of promoting cultural diversity, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.</p><p>The government is not currently considering airplay quotas based on production location<font color="#1F497D">.</font></p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention which will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. </p>  <p>  The contract for this work was signed with National Broadband Ireland (NBI) last November and by the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the next 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. Further information on deployment activities is available on NBI&rsquo;s website (www.nbi.ie). </p>  <p>  To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main NBP deployment. The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie. The BCP delivery project is well underway and surveying of the BCP locations is progressing which will facilitate detailed design and installation. BCP locations are subject to change and a number of the premises initially identified are in the process of being replaced with alternative locations. The remaining BCPs remain on track for delivery by the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The BCPs in identified public places will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised. </p></reply>

Since 2000, approximately 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light. Approximately &euro;120 million has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency schemes in 2020.  The SEAI and Department monitor the impact of the schemes on an ongoing basis.   </p>  <p>  The primary aim of the Warmer Homes Scheme is to address energy poverty by delivering energy efficiency measures to those homeowners deemed to be in, or at risk of, such poverty.  The programme delivers many benefits to homeowners including improved comfort, quality of life, and health.  Since 2000, the scheme has provided upgrades to over 142,000 homes across Ireland, improving the lives of some of Ireland&rsquo;s most vulnerable citizens. The Scheme underwent a significant change in mid-2018, expanding to include more extensive measures, including external wall insulation which is now funded under the scheme. This has resulted in deeper retrofits and greater energy savings for homeowners.  In 2018, 77% of homes upgraded under the scheme saw at least one energy consumption classification change. </p>  <p>  A recently published audit conducted by the European Court of Auditors assessed whether EU co-funded energy efficiency investments in buildings, including under Ireland&rsquo;s Warmer Homes Scheme, had cost-effectively helped the EU toward its 2020 energy saving target.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the scope of the Court of Auditors report addresses EU funding of the scheme over the period 2014-2018 in terms of energy efficiency only and not other benefits such as energy poverty reductions, which is the primary aim of the Warmer Homes Scheme.  Furthermore, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently undertaking a social impact assessment of the SEAI&rsquo;s energy poverty schemes, including the Warmer Homes Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030.  Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.  To deliver our target, a Retrofit Taskforce has been established which will develop a plan to implement a new retrofitting delivery model. The target for development of the plan is Q3 2020.  </p>  <p>  The audit findings will be considered in the context of the reform and development of energy efficiency schemes.</p></reply>

I am committed to transposing and implementing this Directive at the earliest possible date.  This Directive gives me the power to ban certain single use items from being placed on the market, including polystyrene food and beverage containers, plastic cutlery and plates, straws and balloon sticks.  I will also be introducing measures to significantly reduce our reliance on typical on-the-go items such as single use food and beverage containers. I am currently exploring what measures, including the possible introduction of levies, will best deliver on this ambition.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan committed to looking at a number of possible environmental levies, including a possible levy on single use plastics, as part of the review of the Environment Fund. In the context of proposed levies, my Department published a consultation paper in late 2019 which outlined proposals with regard to environmental levies. This is available on my Department's website at www.DCCAE.gov.ie. This consultation was designed to help inform the development of a new range of environmental levies on a phased basis over the period 2020-2025, aimed at encouraging positive environmental behavioural change and climate action.

The report sets out the Commissioner&rsquo;s analysis of the challenges facing the Midlands region, and for Bord na M&oacute;na workers and their families and communities, arising from an accelerated exit from peat harvesting. The report also contains a number of important recommendations. The Government is already acting on a number of these and is committed to preparing a detailed implementation plan to address the remainder. A copy of the report and Government's initial response is available on my Department's website at dccae.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I have met the Just Transition Commissioner on a number of occasions since his appointment by me in November 2019, including most recently on 16 March and 12 May, both of which took place by tele-conference. At these meetings, the Commissioner took the opportunity to update me on progress in his work and to brief me on the recommendations contained in his report, respectively.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed significant resources in 2020, through allocating a portion of the additional carbon tax revenue to be raised on foot of Budget 2020, to measures to support the delivery of an effective just transition for the Midlands.  This includes &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme to be focused on the Midlands, &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate and &euro;6 million for a dedicated new just transition fund with ESB agreeing to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund. The Government is also examining measures to support a much higher level of bog restoration on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and to provide for a continued role for existing Bord na M&oacute;na workers on these bogs.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Just Transition Fund, I have now launched a first call for proposals for funding. Stage 1 of accessing the Just Transition Fund is to register your project with the Midlands Regional Transition Team and START (Secretariat Technical Assistance to Regions in Transition) on www.midlandsireland.ie. In Stage 2, my Department will launch a detailed evaluation process for projects that have applied under Stage 1.</p>  <p>  I have previously set out five key priorities for this fund as follows:</p>  <p>  -  retraining and reskilling workers to assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition;</p>  <p>  -  proactive communications with affected communities and other stakeholders in the region and between local communities and the relevant national institutions;</p>  <p>  -  best practice sharing networks and frameworks;</p>  <p>  -  the early development of local transition plans, with local communities at the core of plan development, based on economic analysis and local scoping of transition impacts and the opportunities it presents, acknowledging that the needs of individual areas across the Midlands will differ; and</p>  <p>-  innovation and investment proposals to generate sustainable employment in green enterprise that do not come within the ambit of the four Project Ireland 2040 Funds, or the State&rsquo;s other investment programmes.   </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p>  <p>  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. There may be a choice of operators offering a service in the area referred to and further information in this regard is available at www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services.​ </p>  <p>Under the State led intervention, all counties, including Co. Westmeath, will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed.  Further information on deployment activities is available on NBI&rsquo;s website ( www.nbi.ie ).   </p>  <p>  I note that there is fibre installation close to the premises mentioned in the Question. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and not part of the planned State led intervention network. The decision as to what areas and premises are served was made by eir  on a commercial basis and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that process. </p>  <p>  To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main NBP deployment. The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie. The BCP delivery project is well underway and surveying of the BCP locations is progressing which will facilitate detailed design and installation. BCP locations are subject to change and a number of the premises initially identified are in the process of being replaced with alternative locations. The remaining BCPs remain on track for delivery by the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  The BCPs in identified public places will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised.</p></reply>

While many of these activities are underway, the deployment of fibre to pass homes is a quarter four activity and the first homes passed will be able to get connected before the end of this year. By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed.

Afforestation, the use of bog land carbon repositories, and wind generated electricity can each contribute to carbon reduction.</p><p>Forestry provides verifiable removal and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere and will help in meeting our EU commitments over the period 2021 to 2030. The Climate Action Plan sets a target of an average of 8,000 hectares per annum of newly planted forest between 2021 to 2030.</p><p>Bogs also play a vital role, <i>inter alia</i>, in mitigating climate change effects. This is recognised in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, which includes a range of actions including the development of further measures to help rehabilitate exploited and degraded peatlands. The Government announced in Budget 2020 that &euro;5m would be made available for bog restoration and rehabilitation which will restore bogs to their natural habitat and help to capture carbon. With the injection of this funding, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht intends to restore over 1,800 hectares of protected raised bog. An expanded bog restoration is also under development with Bord na Mona.  </p><p>The Climate Action Plan sets out a target of moving to 70% renewable electricity by 2030 which would reduce emissions to 4-5 MtCO2eq annually. Both offshore and onshore wind are expected to contribute significantly to decarbonisation of the electricity sector. In 2018, wind generated electricity alone avoided 3.1 million tonnes of CO2 according to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. </p></reply>

The Roadmap specifies that decisions in relation to which actions will be taken and which public health measures might be lifted will be made in accordance with the Framework for Future Decision-Making which is as follows:</p><p>1. Before each Government consideration of the easing of restrictions, the Department of Health will provide a report to the Government regarding the following on/off trigger criteria:</p><p>a. The latest data regarding the progression of the disease,</p><p>b. The capacity and resilience of the health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy,</p><p>c. The capacity of the programme of sampling, testing and contact tracing,</p><p>d. The ability to shield and care for at risk groups,</p><p>e. An assessment of the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.</p><p>2. It will also provide risk-based public health advice on what measures could be modified in the next period.</p><p>3. The Government would then consider what restrictions could be lifted, having regard to the advice of the Department of Health as well as other social and economic considerations, e.g. the potential for increased employment, relative benefits for citizens and businesses, improving national morale and wellbeing etc.</p><p>4. It is acknowledged that there is also an ongoing possibility that restrictions could be re-imposed and this process will be carried out on an ongoing basis once every 3 weeks.</p><p>As is clear from the framework, it is the Government rather than I or my Department that will decide on any modifications to the current public health measures in place and those decisions will be informed by the status of the on/off trigger criteria and the public health advice received at the time that a decision is being made. </p><p>Guidance in relation to specific sectors of the economy should in the first instance be sought from the Government Department with responsibility for that sector. </p></reply>

Under the EU Package Travel Directive customers retain their right to a cash refund in circumstances where their holiday cannot proceed due to &lsquo;unavoidable or extraordinary circumstances&rsquo;, if they do not wish to reschedule for a later date or accept an alternative package. Travel agents and tour operators are required under the Directive to refund customer within 14 days of the customer requesting to cancel a package holiday.</p>  <p>  At the same time, I am also aware that travel agents and tour operators are having difficulties themselves securing refunds from their suppliers, including airlines, and it is clear that the unprecedented scale of the impact of Covid-19 has affected the capacity of the sector to respond as it should.   Whilst consumers are entitled to a cash refund, the Government has agreed to provide protection for credit notes or vouchers issued by travel agents and tour operators, if their customers agree to accept them. Under the scheme, for which legal provisions are being drafted, the State will guarantee the cash value of any such voucher - to be known as a Refund Credit Note - which can be used at a later date to rebook or can be redeemed for cash in 6 months.  The idea is to give the sector some breathing space, subject on customer agreement, and it reflects recommendations made by the EU Commission.  All parties - customers and travel agents - are feeling the financial impact of Covid, and the Government is trying to provide a way that gives everyone some assurance.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licensed driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, even in the case of frontline workers.  </p>  <p>  An unaccompanied learner driver who is stopped by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may face penalty points, a fixed charge, seizure of the vehicle and possible prosecution. </p>  <p>  Due to the closure of services provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, I took measures to extend the validity of number of documents, including the learner permit.  Any learner permits which were due to expire from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 inclusive have had their period of validity extended by 4 months.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing will be of particular concern to learner drivers.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the driving test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>   The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the COVID-19 situation presents huge challenges for very many business sectors.</p>  <p>  That is why we have worked to introduce a wide programme of Government supports for impacted businesses.  The range of supports available includes new schemes of wage subsidies, rates waivers, re-start grants, lending facilities, equity injection, and business advisory supports for example. I also note that self-employed owner-operators of SPSVs may avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of &euro;350 a week.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has also taken a number of actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change.</p>  <p>  The NTA has extended licences expiring before 12 June 2020 by three months, waived late licence renewal fees, and temporarily relaxed rules around vehicle age limits. It has engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences.  Arrangements are in place to facilitate the swift re-activation of the suspended licence when such an SPSV operator wishes to return to work.</p></reply>

It should be ready for publication soon. As reflected in the Government's policy statement on the matter - which was published in September 2017 - the Bill provides for the establishment of a newly reconstituted regulatory Irish Aviation Authority - merging the  safety and security regulatory functions of the current IAA with the economic regulation and consumer affairs functions of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. This will create a single aviation regulator, and it will represent an important modernisation and strengthening of aviation regulation in Ireland. The draft Bill also provides for the establishment of a completely separate, commercial State-owned air navigation service provider. This new company will operate as a regulated commercial entity, and for so long as it continues to make a profit - noting that it is a State monopoly - it will continue to pay the State annual dividends.</p>  <p>  Being very much an outlier internationally, the institutional separation of Ireland&rsquo;s aviation regulatory and commercial air navigation service provision functions is important. It is an old model, which was put in place in the early 1990s and has remained largely unchanged since. The industry and what constitutes effective regulation has moved on. The reforms I have set in motion are in line with international best practice, and they will enhance the State&rsquo;s aviation sector through the establishment of a stronger and more robust regulatory environment. While progress has been made on the legislative front, I have been less happy with the pace of preparation in the IAA to prepare for the changes, and I have made that clear to the Board and the management.  </p>  <p>  These benefits of the reform, and the broad stakeholder support for it, were recently underlined in a report on the safety performance of the IAA, which I commissioned under Section 32 of the IAA Act 1993. This report noted, as I have raised myself, that the progress on the reform project has not been achieved as quickly as expected.  </p>  <p>  When the time comes to publish the Bill and seek Oireachtas endorsement, I am confident that this is one of those legislative proposals that will lend itself to broad political support.</p></reply>

As things stand in law, air passenger rights are protected by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, which covers the rights of passenger in instances of cancellations and other scenarios, including long delays.  However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law. </p><p>My understanding is that the current practice of the two main Irish airlines serving the Irish market, having regard to the Covid-19 travel restrictions, is to offer their customers the opportunity to rebook a flight for later in the year or to receive a voucher. There is, however, no legal obligation on them to provide a full refund, irrespective of the Government advices.  </p><p>Consumers who wish to clarify their entitlements in respect of airlines should consult the Commission for Aviation Regulation's consumer affairs website .

Measures introduced by the Government to date, which have benefitted sports and community clubs as well as their national sporting bodies, include: the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the series of enterprise supports ranging from liquidity funding, loan schemes and grants/vouchers, as well as deferred tax payments and deferral of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the particular difficulties and challenges facing sporting organisations, both locally and nationally. A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies. Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis in relation to the development of protocols to facilitate a safe return to training and competition.</p>  <p>  This extensive engagement with the sport sector has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape. It has also demonstrated the importance of implementing an appropriate and focused response to the challenges facing all strands of the sector, ranging from the local sporting organisations and clubs to the National Governing Bodies. It is accordingly intended to develop a Sport Recovery Action Plan, in consultation with the sector, aimed at minimising the impacts and preparing the sector to restart activity, as part of the national recovery and renewal.</p></reply>

The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licenced driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that the current pass rate for driving tests nationally stands at 52% for 2019, so having fulfilled all of the driving lesson requirements does not mean that an individual meets the standard required to pass the test. </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, even in the case of frontline workers. </p>  <p>  An unaccompanied learner driver who is stopped by an Garda Siochana may face penalty points, a fixed charge, seizure of the vehicle and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Due to the closure of services provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, I took measures to extend the validity of number of documents, including the learner permit.  Any learner permits which were due to expire from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 inclusive have had their period of validity extended by 4 months.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing will be of particular concern to learner drivers.  As you will appreciate, the driving test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

Irish driver licensing law operates within a framework of EU law, which among other things sets the standards to be met in driving tests in all Member States. On this basis, EU driving licences are mutually exchangeable.</p><p>When it comes to licence exchange with non-EU countries, we may reach bilateral agreements.  In order to qualify for this programme, we must first ensure that the driving licence and testing regime is of at least the same high quality as that in operation in this country.  The United States is not one of the countries with which such an arrangement is currently in place.  This reflects the wide variation in standards under licences are obtained in the US - which one of the reasons for the variation in road safety across the states, many of which have road safety records significantly worse than any EU Member State.</p><p>Where a person takes up residence in Ireland with a driving licence which is not from the EU and not from a jurisdiction with which we have a bilateral agreement, this leaves us with the position where the only alternative is to ask them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence. </p><p>This link provides information on how to obtain an Irish driving licence as the holder of a licence from another Country;  </p><p>At present, the only differences allowed where someone is the holder of a full but non-exchangeable licence is that they are not required to wait the normal 6 months before applying for the test and they undergo a reduced number of 6 Essential Driver Training (EDT) lessons.</p><p>The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p><p>The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

The guidance also states explicitly that social distancing should be maintained at all times. It is also important to highlight that the public health advice for those who are cocooning is to continue to stay at home, except for brief outdoor exercise within 5km of their home. </p>  <p>  It has been brought to my attention that, while the overwhelming majority of people are fully respecting the public health guidelines, there have been some difficulties in relation to adherence to the 5km travel restriction by people engaging in sporting activity during Phase One.  This situation is both regrettable and concerning. Sport Ireland has been in communication with the sporting organisations concerned to voice this concern and to reinforce the importance of the memberships of all sporting organisations respecting the Roadmap and complying with public health regulations at all times.</p></reply>

As I stated then, it has great potential to contribute to economic regeneration along its route from Collooney in Sligo to Manorhamilton in Leitrim and to Blacklion on the Cavan -Fermanagh border before crossing into Fermanagh and ending in Enniskillen.</p>  <p>  The last round of construction funding for Greenways required projects to have planning permission and ready access to the land required for the Greenway in place for us to provide funding. Unfortunately the SLNCR did not have that in place so was not in a position to be awarded funding for construction at that time.</p>  <p>  Late last year, I announced a funding call under the Carbon Tax Fund for support for planning and design for Greenways and Leitrim County Council submitted an application for support under that call. I anticipate that funding under this initiative will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of a specific reference to the SLNCR Greenway in the "New Decade, New Approach" document that led to the re-opening of Stormont gives a strong indication of the level of support that the Greenway has in Government, both North and South.</p></reply>

Ensuring the provision of integrated public transport services (bus, rail, light-rail and taxi) by public and private operators throughout the State is the statutory responsibility of the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and it has been designated among the essential services that are to carry on. I would like to thank operators and staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times. </p>  <p>  Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has been working closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to ensure public transport services continue and to plan for the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both PSO and commercial transport operators and will publish their proposals shortly. My Department is also engaging directly with PSO and commercial operators to help inform policy decisions in relation to the public transport sector as we progress through the various phases of the Roadmap.  My Department is also engaged intensively across Government in relation to progressing relevant issues.  In view of these necessary approaches and engagements to address what is already a complex and difficult set of issues, I have no plans, at this time, to establish an additional administrative structure.</p></reply>

Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, still less in the case of frontline workers, the protection of whose lives and health is critical for them, their families and indeed all of us.

As you will appreciate, the driving test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.

Measures introduced by the Government to date, which have benefitted national sporting organisations such as the GAA and their clubs include: the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the series of enterprise supports ranging from liquidity funding, loan schemes and grants\vouchers, as well as deferred tax payments and deferral of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the particular difficulties and challenges facing sporting organisations, both locally and nationally. A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies and the GAA has participated in every meeting of the group thus far. Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis in relation to the development of protocols to facilitate a safe return to training and competition.</p>  <p>  This extensive engagement with the sport sector has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape. It has also demonstrated the importance of implementing an appropriate and focused response to the challenges facing all strands of the sector, ranging from the local sporting organisations and clubs to the National Governing Bodies such as the GAA. It is accordingly intended to develop a Sport Recovery Action Plan, in consultation with the sector, aimed at minimising the impacts and preparing the sector to restart activity, as part of the national recovery and renewal.</p></reply>

In Europe, aviation movements have plummeted by about 90% while passenger traffic is 99% below comparable periods last year.  Like other Irish Airports, Shannon Airport has been severely impacted by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in response to Covid-19, the Government has put in place a broad range of supports to help mitigate the effects of the crisis on our citizens and businesses. One such support is the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.  This Scheme allows employers to continue to pay their employees during the COVID-19 emergency. It aims, as we know, to keep employees registered with their employers, so that they will be able to get back to work quickly after the pandemic.  Shannon Group is availing of this Scheme.   Details of the full suite of Covid-19 Government funding and supports have been notified to Shannon Group for consideration.</p>  <p>  In relation to Aer Lingus or indeed any other airline operating services from Shannon, the position is that there are currently no flight restrictions in place in Ireland and the operation of any route from Shannon, is a commercial decision for airlines, in consultation with the airport and other stakeholders.  Aer Lingus has advised my Department that it will keep its schedule under review having regard to the changing circumstances.</p></reply>

Measures introduced by the Government to date, which have benefitted national sporting organisations include: the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the series of enterprise supports ranging from liquidity funding, loan schemes and grants\vouchers, as well as deferred tax payments and deferral of commercial rates. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the particular difficulties and challenges facing sporting organisations. A COVID-19 Sports Monitoring Group, chaired at Ministerial level, has been established to engage directly with the sporting bodies. Sport Ireland is also directly engaging with the sporting bodies on an ongoing basis in relation to the development of protocols to facilitate a safe return to training and competition. An Expert Group on Return to Sport has also been established, which will provide guidance to the sporting bodies so that they can prepare for the phased return to sporting activity in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Business and Society.</p>  <p>  This extensive engagement with the sport sector has highlighted the significant, adverse impact of COVID-19 at all levels of the Irish sporting landscape. It has also demonstrated the importance of implementing an appropriate and focused response to the challenges facing all strands of the sector, ranging from the local sporting organisations and clubs to the National Governing Bodies. It is accordingly intended to develop a Sport Recovery Action Plan, in consultation with the sector, aimed at minimising the impacts and preparing the sector to restart activity, as part of the national recovery and renewal. It is considered that these arrangements and plans will serve to protect and develop Irish sport for the future.</p></reply>

Section 32(2) of that Act provides that the Minister may by order, after consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, amend the list of ports of registry mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Act.  The Revenue Commissioners hold the statutory ship registration role and appoint the registrars of ships.  Currently there are 13 ports of registry designated as such in accordance with the 1955 Act. Any proposal for additional ports of registry would require consideration in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, including having regard to the merits of each location and the ongoing resource and administration implications that would arise.</p>  <p>  The Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act 2014, although not yet commenced, provides a basis for the introduction of an updated and modernised ship registration system in Ireland, replacing the 1955 Act.  The 2014 Act provides an enabling framework for the introduction of a new centralised, electronic Irish Register of Ships.  Section 30 of the Act will facilitate changes to the list of ports of registry having regard to a number of considerations, including the demand for a port to be a port of registry, the importance of the location and the level of maritime activity at the port.  When the new central Irish Register of Ships is in place and the 2014 Act is commenced, I will be open to considering the case for a particular port to be made a port of registry that is made on the basis of the framework set out in the Act.  </p>  <p>  Pending the commencement of the 2014 Act, I have no plans to review the list of ports of registry. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, the driving test raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.

The purpose of the driving test is to set out the minimum level of knowledge, skill and competency that a learner must demonstrate in order to become a fully licensed driver. Until a learner can meet this standard and pass this test, they are not safe to take to our roads without appropriate supervision.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that the current pass rate for driving tests nationally stands at 52% for 2019, so having fulfilled all of the driving lesson requirements does not mean that an individual meets the standard required to pass the test. </p>  <p>  Studies have repeatedly shown that unaccompanied learner drivers are markedly more likely to be involved in fatal collisions.  For that reason, there can be no exceptions to the current laws in force around learner drivers.  Regrettably, there has been an increase in fatalities on our roads so far in 2020, and we must not relax the standards required of our drivers before being awarded a driving licence, even in the case of frontline workers.</p>  <p>  An unaccompanied learner driver who is stopped by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may face penalty points, a fixed charge, seizure of the vehicle and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  Due to the closure of services provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, I took measures to extend the validity of number of documents, including the learner permit.  Any learner permits which were due to expire from 1 March 2020 to 30 June 2020 inclusive have had their period of validity extended by 4 months. If it is the case that the NDLS centres have not re-opened before the extension period expires, the possibility of a further extension will be examined.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently working, in consultation with my Department, on plans for the resumption of the range of services and functions for which it is responsible, following the publication of the Government roadmap and, more recently, the National Return to Work Safety Protocol as agreed by employer and trade union representatives.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of driver testing raises particular problems in terms of compliance with the Protocol and in particular social distancing rules, as it requires the driver tester and the candidate to be within a two metre distance continuously for a period in excess of 20 minutes, in a very confined space which is not in itself a workplace under the control of the RSA.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the inability to carry out driving tests at this time is among the many difficulties that we all are having to endure at this time, for those awaiting such tests.  On a very preliminary appraisal of the Protocol, car driving tests may have to be the last of the statutory functions, for which the RSA is responsible, to recommence in or after Phase 5 of the Government's roadmap.</p>  <p>  Dates for the resumption of the RSA's services, and any special arrangements which will need to be put into place to allow for the provision of these services, will be determined in consultation with the relevant health authorities.</p>  <p>  I understand that the individual having completed 9 of the 12 Essential Driver Training lessons is concerned that their theory test is running out.  A driver theory test is required before a person can apply for a learner permit, and a learner permit is required to take the lessons.  The certificate issued on passing a theory test is valid for two years and should be used to apply for a learner permit within that time.  In light of the Covid crisis, I have extended the validity of all theory test certificates which were due to expire from 1 March 2010 to 30 June 2020 inclusive by 4 months.  If the person in question has a learner permit the validity of his theory test is no longer relevant.  If he does not have a learner permit, he should not be driving. </p>  <p>  The safety of the public is of paramount importance at this time, whether from infection or from deaths and injuries on the road, and in this as in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, my Department will be guided by NPHET and national experts.</p></reply>

Primary responsibility for compliance with international convention requirements rests with the ship owner and the Flag State Administration of the ship concerned. There are currently no oil tankers flying the flag of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Regulation 37 of Annex I to the MARPOL Convention requires that every oil tanker of 150 gross tonnage and above (and every ship other than an oil tanker of 400 gross tonnage or above), shall carry on board a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan, approved by the ship&rsquo;s Flag State Administration. An International Oil Pollution Prevention (IOPP) Certificate issued to a ship by the Flag State, or a Recognised Organisation acting on its behalf, certifies that the ship complies with the applicable requirements of Annex I of the Convention and the certificate must be carried onboard.

An International Ship Security (ISS) Certificate issued to a ship by the Flag State, or a Recognised Security Organisation acting on its behalf,  certifies that the ship complies with the applicable requirements of Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS Convention and the mandatory requirements of the IMO&rsquo;s  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code.   In addition, in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, the Marine Survey Office of my Department  requires that a for a ship intending to enter a port in the State, the following information is provided to it, prior to the arrival of the ship:-  </p>  <p>  - that the ship possesses a valid  ISS Certificate and the name of its issuing authority; </p>  <p>  - the security level at which the ship is currently operating; </p>  <p>  - the security level at which the ship operated in the previous 10 ports where it has conducted a ship/port interface;</p>  <p>  - any special or additional security measures that were taken by the ship in the previous 10 ports where it has conducted a ship/port interface;</p>  <p>  - that the appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during any ship to ship activity carried out within the period of the last 10 port calls; or </p>  <p>  - other practical security related information (but not details of the ship security plan), taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.</p>  <p>  Ships that do not comply with the SOLAS maritime security requirements may be subject to additional controls, up to and including the refusal of access of a ship into Irish ports .</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.2424.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700156#WRDDD04500"><p>Low pay and poor working conditions in the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and hence cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff. I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.</p>  <p>  My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families. First 5 recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. First 5 includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce, and last year I began a process of developing a Workforce Development Plan to achieve this and other workforce-related commitments in First 5.</p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, last year I also appointed an Expert Group to develop a new Funding Model for early learning and care and school-age childcare. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in early learning and care and school-age childcare systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.</p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions in the sector indicates that the average pay is influenced by the level of a practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications. For example, the average pay rates for graduate workers is somewhat higher than for others working in the sector. Practitioners with Level 5 and Level 6 qualifications earned an average of &euro;11.42 and &euro;12.63 respectively in 2019. The average rates of pay for graduates at that time were &euro;13.93 for those with qualifications at Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications, &euro;13.45 for those with Level 8 qualifications, and &euro;15.18 for those with qualifications at Levels 9 or 10. Overall, the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55, which was 3% higher than the year before. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare, resulting in a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  I have actively encouraged the sector to seek a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO). An SEO must be initiated by a grouping representing the sector and my Department is ready to input to such a process, if and when the sector seeks it. Organisations requesting the commencement of such a process must show they are substantially representative of the sector. An SEO would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the early learning and care and school age childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, and other conditions.</p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in continuous professional development (CPD).</p></reply>

These included the suspension of funding pending the appointment of a new Board, the appointment of Ms Jillian Van Turnhout to conduct a review of governance, which was completed in June 2018, and the requirement for regular updates on governance reforms by Scouting Ireland to my Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year, I appointed Ms Brigid McManus to conduct a follow-up review of governance in Scouting Ireland.  This was published on 8th May and confirmed that all of Ms Van Turnhout&rsquo;s recommendations had been satisfactorily implemented, while outlining a small number of matters for follow up. </p>  <p>  I welcome the publication by Mr. Elliott of his learning review into historical sexual abuse in scouting.  My thoughts are with the adults who suffered so gravely as children through their involvement with scouting and who have carried this burden with them into their adult lives.   </p>  <p>  I met with Mr Elliott, following receipt of his review, and was pleased to hear that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the findings, he was very positive about the current governance arrangements in Scouting Ireland, with a Board that is strong and well-functioning, and with robust safeguarding in place.  Tusla has also written to the Department to indicate its satisfaction with current safeguarding practice in Scouting Ireland, particularly as it relates to the agreed Scouting Ireland / Tusla Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Government had previously undertaken to give careful consideration to the question of an appropriate statutory investigation following the RT&Eacute; Investigates programme &ldquo;Scouts Dishonour&rdquo;. It was appropriate for Government to await the reports from Ms Brigid McManus and Mr Ian Elliott to inform this consideration.  In this regard, it is noted that Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report suggests that a statutory inquiry may face the same limitations as his Learning Review.  Mr Elliott has also emphasised the cooperation of Scouting Ireland in relation to his review.  As such, a key factor is whether a statutory or public inquiry would uncover new information.  This is something which will need to be taken into account in contemplating the question of an inquiry. </p></reply>

The re-opening of ELC and SAC services will be guided by public health advice first and foremost, in accordance with the phases announced by the Government recently. </p>  <p>   The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the childcare sector. The TWSCS layers on the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and operates in tandem to this scheme.  Hence, any decisions by the Department regarding the TWSCS will therefore be guided by Government decisions regarding the TWSS in the first instance. For the present, the TWSCS will run in parallel with Revenue operated TWSS to support the particular circumstances of this sector and to ensure that, once this crisis passes, ELC and SAC services will be in a position to re-open and return to their important work.</p>  <p>   A number of supports were available before COVID to improve the sustainability of services during normal times. These remain available now; and it is expected that this will continue as normal when services can safely reopen. Financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic. However, I hope the Deputy can appreciate that our immediate focus is the administration of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme which is in itself a significant sustainability measure, and to address other urgent issues.</p>  <p>   My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years.

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues. This includes minimising  the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, and the impacts that a potential change to staff ratio requirements would have on capacity, sustainability, and staff recruitment and retention. </p>  <p>  In addition, it is vital that we, ensure that any restrictions are consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  I am also establishing a Reference Group to widen the scope of consultation with the ELC and SAC sector, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group and to give an opportunity to provider representatives who are not represented on this group to make their views known to me and my officials. I hope to hold periodic meetings of the Group as we work through the phased reopening of the ELC and SAC sector. The first meeting of the Reference Group will be held on Thursday, 28 May 2020.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are at an advanced stage will have due regard to public health guidance over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from 29 June in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage. I am committed to sharing guidelines and other resources as soon as possible after they have been finalised with the assistance of the Advisory Group.</p></reply>

The brief included:</p><p>- analysing the current costs of providing childcare and the factors that impact on these costs;</p><p>- the development and delivery of a model of the unit costs of providing childcare that allows analysis of policy changes and variation in cost-drivers, including the potential impact of professionalisation; and</p><p>- providing an objective, high-level market analysis of the childcare sector in Ireland, including analysis of fee levels charged to parents.</p><p>An approach and methodology were decided upon in partnership with the DCYA and a number of key activities have been undertaken to date. These include:</p><p>- engagement with key stakeholders from the sector, including the Early Years Forum, provider representative organisations, the City and County Childcare Committees, statutory bodies, childcare professional training bodies, and academics;</p><p>- the administration of a survey to all centre-based childcare providers nationally, to provide the data on which the modelling tool would be based;</p><p>- the development of a cost modelling tool (and guidance document) to present the baseline cost data and enable the testing of the impact of a range of scenarios, namely changes to cost drivers on the unit costs of delivering childcare services; and</p><p>- a final report detailing the elements of the review, and the key findings.</p><p>The project is intended to provide a robust evidence base for the further development of high quality ELC and SAC in Ireland. The outputs, including the costs calculator developed through this project are also intended to form a key input into the setting of capitation and subvention rates for future funding schemes and will be considered by the Expert Group recently convened to develop a new funding model for ELC and SAC.</p><p>The draft final report, cost modelling tool and guidance were subject to peer review. Arising from the external peer review, an additional piece of work was undertaken. Final outputs were received in January 2020, and preparation was underway to launch the report in April 2020. However, owing to the volume of work associated with COVID-19, its launch has regrettably had to be postponed to Summer 2020.</p></reply>

To support children's inclusion in the ECCE programme, the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has since 2016 provided a range of supports for access and meaningful participation of children with disabilities. An increasing number of children with disabilities, including children with complex needs, have attended their local pre-school with the supports provided through AIM. </p><p>The AIM supports include a pilot (introduced in 2019) of nursing support and healthcare assistance for children with complex healthcare needs. This pilot measure is supporting a number of children in receipt of a paediatric home care package through the HSE to benefit also from nursing or healthcare assistance to permit their participation in the ECCE programme in a mainstream preschool setting. </p><p>In addition to the AIM supports in mainstream pre-schools, a small number of children with complex needs attend HSE-funded specialist pre-schools run by a number of agencies. The Donegal County Childcare Committee may be able to assist the family referred to by the Deputy in identifying potential pre-school options in the local area, and can be contacted on Tel: 074 91 23442 or by email at .</p></reply>

I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  I have already put in place a number of supports to assist ELC and SAC providers in this time. TheTemporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS), launched by my Department on 15 April, builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. It provides funds for staffing and overhead costs, while ensuring that parents are not charged fees for the duration of the scheme. </p>  <p>  As part of pre-existing sustainability funding, financial supports are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  My Department has begun to consider whether this sustainability funding can be extended to private services during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  These sector-specific supports are complemented by the range of supports across Government, many of which can also be availed of by ELC and SAC providers. This includes grants and loans for small businesses, advice and support from Local Enterprise Offices, the cancellation of commercial rates for a period, and a re-opening grant for small and medium enterprises. Further information on these supports is available from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports.

Investment in ELC and SAC has increased by 141% over the last five years. This has enabled us deliver, for example, a second year of free pre-school to all children, the international award winning Access and Inclusion Model for children with disabilities, a doubling of the number of children in receipt of subsidies, an increase in the number of places by approximately 60%, and the highly innovative and progressive National Childcare Scheme.  However, I acknowledge that regardless of the positive strides made, more investment is  needed.  Historic under investment in ELC and SAC has created a situation that has no quick solution. </p><p>In terms of policy approaches, my Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028</i>. A key vehicle to ensure that significant additional investment in the sector delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model. This new Funding Model will provide mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and SAC providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.</p><p>An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC was announced in September 2019 and commenced its work in October 2019.  The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes to:</p><p>- Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC</p><p>- Review the existing approach to funding ELC and SAC services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage</p><p>- Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for ELC and SAC could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives</p><p>- Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government.</p><p>The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.</p><p>A consultation and engagement process to take account of the voices of providers, practitioners, parents and other stakeholders within the sector had to be postponed due to COVID-19. Further information on the Funding Model and its progress is available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation that has required a series of emergency responses from the Government. I am acutely aware of the particular impact this has had on ELC and SAC providers, practitioners, parents and children. I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. </p><p>As a direct response to the COVID-19 closure of ELC and SAC services, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) which is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p><p>- to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p><p>- to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC / SAC place when services resume and</p><p>- to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector.</p><p>The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. </p><p>Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in ELC and SAC. Additional investment of &euro;63.6m brought investment to &euro;638m in 2020, as noted a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure these policy outcomes. </p><p>My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment for children, families and our much valued ELC and SAC workforce and ensure that, when COVID- 19 has passed, we will have retained as many services, staff and places as possible and that we are moving progressively towards the vision outlined in First 5 which was unanimously welcomed by all stakeholders.</p><p>I welcome a recent evaluation by the European Commission which noted that substantial progress had been made in recent years in the area of childcare. It recognised the systemic, comprehensive and strategic cross Government approach that had been adopted, the development of important legislation in the area and the solid plans for the future.  My Department remains committed to maintaining this momentum and transforming early learning and care to a system that is truly accessible, affordable and of high quality.</p></reply>

This is to avoid households mixing, and is important as part of the stay at home measures. </p>  <p>  On 1 May the Government released its Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, which sets out Ireland's plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions through five phases. The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services, which includes childminding, will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap proposes the gradual re-opening of ELC/SAC services as follows: </p>  <p>  - Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  - Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing proposals for the different phases of reopening in line with the Roadmap. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues.  </p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical constraints that services - including childminders - face. I have established and chair an Advisory Group that includes membership from across the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Childminding Ireland, Early Childhood Ireland, the National Childhood Network, the National Forum for Community Childcare Services, PL&Eacute;, Pobal, Seas Seas and SIPTU, as well as Pobal and Tusla. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently liaising with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) in relation to advice on infection prevention and control, including the use of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE), by childcare providers. Public health guidance on these matters will be shared with childcare providers at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist, including, as referred to by the Deputy, the issues around capacity and how for example the ECCE programme may operate from September. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues.  My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising  the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining  social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring  the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s  well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing  ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring  financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  I am also establishing a Reference Group to widen the scope of consultation with the ELC and SAC sector, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group and to give an opportunity to provider representatives who are not represented on this group to make their views known to me and my officials. I hope to hold periodic meetings of the Group as we work through the phased reopening of the ELC and SAC sector. The first meeting of the Reference Group will be held on Thursday, 28 May 2020.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with this Advisory Group, officials in my Department are undertaking primary research which is currently being rolled out in order to help us forecast supply and demand in the sector for safely delivering early learning and care and school age childcare in the coming months. Arising from that work, my Department will seek to identify ways to maximise capacity in the best interests of children and parents, while meeting the need to ensure that services re-open safely.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to public health guidance over the phases of easing of restrictions.

The closure of centre-based Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) services including those providing Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services on 12 March was an unexpected but necessary move to safeguard public health in Ireland. </p><p>On Friday 1 May, the Government published the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, which sets out Ireland's plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions. The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves.

While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward, in order to ensure that the reopening of ELC and SAC services is managed safely. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising  the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining  social distancing among young children and those caring for them, - </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s  well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are well advanced will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that the circa 2000 ELC and SAC services  around the country that normally open in July and August are currently considering how they can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how they can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage. I am committed to sharing guidelines as soon as possible after they have been finalised with the assistance of the Advisory Group.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.2519.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700158#WRFFF02900"><p>On Friday 1 May, the Government released its Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, which sets out Ireland's plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions through five phases. The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. </p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC/SAC services are stated as follows: </p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. </p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. </p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. My Department has sought public health advice in relation to the plans being put forward. Informed by this advice, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:</p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining  social distancing among young children and those caring for them, </p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s  well-being and development needs and for ELC and  SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred</p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for pre-school children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. </p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.</p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.</p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15, 19 and 26 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.</p>  <p>  I am also establishing a Reference Group to widen the scope of consultation with the ELC and SAC sector, to supplement the work of the Advisory Group and to give an opportunity to provider representatives who are not represented on this group to make their views known to me and my officials. I hope to hold periodic meetings of the Group as we work through the phased reopening of the ELC and SAC sector. The first meeting of the Reference Group will be held on Thursday, 28 May 2020.</p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. </p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that all circa 2000 ELC and SAC services  around the country which are normally open in July and August are currently considering how they can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how they can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  </p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage. I am committed to sharing guidelines and a range of other resources as soon as possible after they have been finalised with the assistance of the Advisory Group.</p></reply>

Funding to services, for youth clubs and to national youth organisations has been maintained. I secured &euro;61.79 million in current funding for my Department's youth funding, an increase of &euro;1.4 million on 2019.  </p>  <p>  My officials have been in regular contact with national youth organisation and the Education and Training Boards to monitor the situation affecting youth services funded by my Department.  I applaud the many services that are delivering essential work in their communities and that have innovated and adapted to find new and different ways of engaging young persons. </p>  <p>  Many organisations now find themselves in financial difficulty due to the ongoing crisis. My colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development put in place a scheme using Dormant Accounts funding.  This comprises &euro;35 million for a Covid-19 Stability Fund and &euro;5 million as a commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, &lsquo;Innovate Together&rsquo;, to focus on projects that provide innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges.  </p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that services that have had to reduce services or hours may be in a position to avail of the other supports provided by the Government, and information is available on the website www.gov.ie, regarding the respective roles of Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  With regard to the informal video conference of EU Ministers for Youth on the 19 May, I communicated my intention to continue funding for youth organisations in Ireland throughout this crisis period.  I highlighted in particular how this funding would allow the continuation of targeted youth support to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.</p></reply>

These included the suspension of funding pending the appointment of a new Board, the appointment of Ms Jillian Van Turnhout to conduct a review of governance, which was completed in June 2018, and the requirement for regular updates on governance reforms by Scouting Ireland to my Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, earlier this year, I appointed Ms Brigid McManus to conduct a follow-up review of governance in Scouting Ireland.  This was published on 8th May and confirmed that all of Ms Van Turnhout&rsquo;s recommendations had been satisfactorily implemented, while outlining a small number of matters for follow up. </p>  <p>  I welcome the publication by Mr. Elliott of his learning review into historical sexual abuse in scouting.  My thoughts are with the adults who suffered so gravely as children through their involvement with scouting and who have carried this burden with them into their adult lives.   </p>  <p>  I met with Mr Elliott, following receipt of his review, and was pleased to hear that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the findings, he was very positive about the current governance arrangements in Scouting Ireland, with a Board that is strong and well-functioning, and with robust safeguarding in place.  Tusla has also written to the Department to indicate its satisfaction with current safeguarding practice in Scouting Ireland, particularly as it relates to the agreed Scouting Ireland / Tusla Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Government had previously undertaken to give careful consideration to the question of an appropriate statutory investigation following the RT&Eacute; Investigates programme &ldquo;Scouts Dishonour&rdquo;. It was appropriate for Government to await the reports from Ms Brigid McManus and Mr Ian Elliott to inform this consideration.  In this regard, it is noted that Mr Elliott&rsquo;s report suggests that a statutory inquiry may face the same limitations as his Learning Review.  Mr Elliott has also emphasised the cooperation of Scouting Ireland in relation to his review.  As such, a key factor is whether a statutory or public inquiry would uncover new information.  This is something which will need to be taken into account in contemplating the question of an inquiry. </p></reply>

Policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality (DJE). Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. DCYA is providing Tusla with &euro;25.3m this year for some 60 organisations that deliver services for these victims. This includes funding and coordinated supports for 21 services that provide emergency refuge and non-refuge accommodation to victims of domestic violence.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that there is currently a relatively low demand for refuge, with some vacant units, most likely reflecting challenges for women around access to services in the current context rather than lower levels of need. Levels of demand are however, beginning to rise. </p>  <p>  Tusla is aware of reduced capacity within some refuges, due to requirements to enforce social distancing or self-isolation measures, particularly where communal facilities may exist. There is also a requirement for additional capacity to address medically advised self-isolation requirements for service users. As facilities, accommodation and arrangements are specific to each service, Tusla is working with individual organisations to address any challenges arising in maintaining essential service provision. </p>  <p>  Tusla reports that as of 22 May 2020, 101 of the 139 family units that would usually be available for victims of domestic violence, were also in use or available for use. To mitigate the impact of social distancing and isolation measures, an additional 45 refuge and non-refuge accommodation units for service users have been secured in the community (as of 22 May 2020), through the efforts of local services with support from Tusla. In total, Tusla had 146 family units available to it on 22 May 2020.</p>  <p>  Tusla is aware that there are and will be issues for service providers, including refuges, throughout and beyond the period of the current emergency public health measures. Tusla has redeployed six members of staff to emergency accommodation services for victims of domestic violence. A total of 18 relief staff are in use across the system, as of 22 May 2020. Tusla has also provided a guidance document to all refuges, mainly in regard to contingency planning in the current health crisis. All guidance is in line with public health guidelines from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p>  <p>  It should be emphasised that the current restrictions on movement do not apply to a person escaping from a risk of harm or seeking to access essential services, such as persons experiencing domestic violence. Tusla provides financial support to the Women&rsquo;s Aid and Male Advice helplines, so that anyone experiencing domestic violence can receive assistance and advice at a time of need. </p>  <p>  To date, Tusla has provided additional funding of approximately &euro;279,964 across DSGBV services since the commencement of the COVID-19 crisis in Ireland. This includes funding for additional staffing, ICT resources for staff working from home, and access to additional accommodation. The matter of funding will be kept under review,  and Tusla will continue to engage with service providers regarding issues and difficulties that may arise at this time. </p></reply>

The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>2. The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>3. Persons with a disability.</p>  <p>  Mindful of the difficulties and issues raised by the sector, the Stability Scheme was established to urgently assist organisations at immediate risk of closure.  The application process for the Stability Scheme was designed to avoid placing unnecessary or onerous administrative burdens on the applicant organisations. This was to ensure swift turnaround times to facilitate draw down of funds by eligible applicants so that they may continue to provide critical services to those most in need in our communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The application deadline was extended by one day in order to facilitate those organisations that had technical issues or required clarification on their eligibility. The application process closed at 8pm on Thursday 21st May 2020. The Scheme has received over 1,000 applications and the assessment and approval process is currently underway.  Organisations approved for funding from the Stability Fund will be informed in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Government will provide a contribution of &euro;5m to this Fund, to be matched over time by philanthropic contributions.  Funding will come from the Dormant Accounts Fund and will be provided immediately, so that grant making can commence.  The Fund will be managed by Social Innovation Fund Ireland (SIFI), overseen by an Advisory Board which will include Departmental officials.  </p>  <p>  As the Fund is still in the initial stages of operation, the information the Deputy is seeking will not be available until the applications under the first call have been evaluated.

It should be noted that the number of approvals differs from the number of applications received, as these schemes are operated on a competitive basis and are generally oversubscribed.</p><p>In relation to the position for 2020, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme are being launched this week as a &euro;30 million package of co-ordinated and complementary supports aimed at aiding the economic and social recovery of rural Ireland in response to COVID-19.  Details in respect of all of these schemes and the projects eligible to receive funding will be available on the gov.ie website by the end of this week. </p><p>Under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the second call for Category 2 projects, relating to project development and enabling initiatives, closed on the 28<sup>th</sup>February 2020.

The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>2. The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>3. Persons with a disability.</p>  <p>  Mindful of the difficulties and issues raised by the sector, the Stability Scheme was established to urgently assist organisations at immediate risk of closure.  The application process for the Stability Scheme was designed to avoid placing unnecessary or onerous administrative burdens on the applicant organisations. This was to ensure swift turnaround times to facilitate draw down of funds by eligible applicants so that they may continue to provide critical services to those most in need in our communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The application deadline was extended by one day in order to facilitate those organisations that had technical issues or required clarification on their eligibility. The application process closed at 8pm on Thursday 21st May 2020. The Scheme has received over 1,000 applications and the assessment and approval process is currently underway.  Organisations approved for funding from the Stability Fund will be informed in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

Victims of domestic violence accommodation needs are met through this joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with the close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide. </p>  <p>  A housing authority can provide, on a humanitarian basis, short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.  </p>  <p>  Generally, where a victim is not seeking to return to the family home, a social housing assessment by the housing authority is the appropriate response.  Assessments should be conducted in a timely manner to ensure that victims do not end up residing in emergency accommodation, including refuge facilities, for long periods of time.  Once a customer has successfully completed a housing needs assessment, they can then apply for HAP.</p>  <p>  As part of this response, Tusla funds and supports over 40 organisations providing support services to victims of domestic violence, including 20 refuges providing safe specialist emergency domestic violence accommodation. Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, and in particular, Domestic Violence refuges have been identified as one of Tusla&rsquo;s three highest priority services in its crisis management responses to the period of Covid-19 public health measures.  A range of supports have been put in place to assure continuity of essential services and there is ongoing systematic engagement between Tusla and service provider organisations around emerging needs.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of HAP, Rent Supplement continues to revert to original role of providing short-term support to those who have become temporarily unemployed and require income support to meet their tenancy cost whilst they seek alternative employment.  Rent supplement, by virtue of its short-term nature and its targeted customer cohort, is not considered the principal solution in meeting the accommodation needs of those fleeing domestic or sexual violence, in particular where, following a Housing Needs Assessment, HAP is an available option. </p>  <p>  There are no indications within my Department that the rent supplement scheme is operating in a way that is preventing victims of domestic violence from getting the support they need, and Community Welfare Officers are using the full flexibility of the scheme to assist those in need during the current crisis.</p>  <p>  As I have already indicated, I support the call for additional supports to be made available to victims of domestic violence during the current pandemic.  Officials from my Department are engaging with SAFE Ireland representatives to explore their proposal and discussions are on-going to ensure that appropriate supports are provided to victims of domestic violence to access short term emergency accommodation during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Following an initial positive meeting, a follow-up meeting is scheduled for later this week to progress the issue.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  </p></reply>

The provisions of Section 12 provide that an employee who has been temporarily laid-off or kept on short-time for four consecutive weeks, or for a series of six weeks within a thirteen week period of which not more than three are consecutive has an entitlement to claim redundancy from their employer.</p><p>As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time. Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.</p><p>In the current emergency situation the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees over a short period of time. Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.</p><p>For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. </p><p>The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13<sup>th</sup>March 2020 to 31<sup>st</sup>May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. The possibility of extending the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered. </p><p>In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.  The Government will also have regard to the Roadmap for re-opening Society and Business. </p><p>It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation. This emergency measure does not impact on the rights of employees who are laid off in ordinary circumstances. All other provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 Act remain in force.</p></reply>

It also provides that an employer must notify the employee of any changes in the particulars given in the statement.  The Act provides a right of complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission where an employer fails to comply with either of the above.</p>  <p>  While an employer may renegotiate the terms and conditions of the contract of employment with an employee, it may not reduce any term of condition to a level lower than statutory entitlement.  It is best practice that any such renegotiation should be undertaken in consultation with the affected employee, and taking a long-term view of the employment relationship. </p>  <p>  Where an individual is made redundant under the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, they can refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission should they feel they have been unfairly selected for redundancy.

They can make their maternity application in line with the original expected start date of at least 2 weeks before the week in which the baby is due.  The person should close their Pandemic Unemployment Payment and move onto Maternity Benefit as planned.  A woman in this situation will then receive her full 26 week maternity benefit payment.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection also provides income support for women who have lost their employment and are unable to return to work at the end of their maternity leave, in the form of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  Women concerned are eligible for this payment from the date when they were due to return to their employment after their maternity leave if they have lost their employment as a consequence of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Women on maternity leave should remain on that leave until such time as they are due to return to work.  A person can also avail of up to 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave which can be added to the end of the 26 week period of paid leave.</p>  <p>  Many employers can, and do, agree compassionate leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off to care for another person or new baby.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to alter shift patterns around their partners work, to work-up time taken, to rearrange parental leave or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work periods.</p>  <p>  Where parents have to continue to work and is it not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees can call on some statutory entitlements which provide for income support including paid Force Majeure Leave, Parent's Leave together with Parent's Benefit, for each parent where a baby was born after 1st November 2019 or unpaid Parental Leave. </p>  <p>  A decision to extend the period of maternity leave for employees would have to be implemented by the Minister for Justice and Equality who has policy and legal responsibility for this area.  In 2020 it is estimated that the Department will spend in excess of &euro;270 million on maternity benefit in respect of an average of 21,000 recipients per week.  Each additional week of maternity benefit, based on current recipient levels, would cost &euro;10.3m increasing to &euro;134 million for a 3 month period.  It should also be noted that there are additional significant costs to the Exchequer as these estimates do not include the costs of salary top-ups and substitution in the public sector.</p>  <p>  The weekly rate of the Covid-19 payment is &euro;350 and is aligned with the jobseeker payment for a person with an adult dependent.  The annual cost on increasing maternity benefit to &euro;350 would be an addition approx. &euro;115m.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.2615.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700160#WRHHH00400"><p>Firstly, I would like to say that my thoughts are with all workers who are dealing with job losses or facing the prospect of redundancies at this difficult time.  I want to assure everybody that my Department is assisting affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months and will continue to do so.  </p>  <p>  An all-of-Government approach has been taken to financially support workers and businesses alike during the emergency period.  In addition to the existing range of social welfare support schemes, the Government has put in place the &lsquo;National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  This includes-</p>  <p>  - the temporary wage subsidy scheme to help affected companies keep paying their employees, maintain the employment relationship and keep businesses viable in order to prevent redundancies;</p>  <p>  - the emergency Pandemic Unemployment Payment for both employed and self-employed workers who have suffered a collapse in income.</p>  <p>  The emergency legislation which was enacted recently effectively suspends the provisions of Section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) which relate to the rights of an employee to claim a redundancy entitlement from their employer after temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work during the Covid-19 emergency period.  This was done to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time, which would only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses and redundancies.</p>  <p>  In implementing all of the above the Government has already put in place significant measures which are helping to prevent redundancies.</p>  <p>  The proposal to withdraw an employer&rsquo;s right to make workers redundant could have far reaching and significant unintended consequences, including interfering with individual contracts of employment.  Furthermore it cannot be said that all employees will want the redundancy provision removed as is suggested.  Employees may have significant service with an employer, and as significant stakeholders in a business be aware that the business is struggling and redundancy may be the better option for some of them.  Restricting their right to access a redundancy payment and seek new work opportunities or reskilling opportunities is a very real issue for them. </p>  <p>  The proposal could also create a risk to an employee's right to a redundancy payment.  The State does not have the power to stop a business closing or to prevent liquidations once the provisions of company law are complied with.  Unfortunately the closure of the business will happen in some circumstances and this is a very real concern fir many business right now, including many small businesses endeavouring to stay in business.  If the right of the employer to make an employee redundant is taken away this could jeopardise an employee&rsquo;s right to compensation by way of a redundancy payment while the liquidation of that company is underway.</p>  <p>  It is also important to bear in mind why redundancy provisions are used.  If a business is in trading and in financial difficulties very often one of the mechanisms used to save that business (which in turn saves some jobs) is redundancy.  An employer may downsize their business and reduce their workforce by way of redundancies in order to continue to be viable.  If the right of the employer to make employees redundant is removed it could result in more permanent job losses.  </p>  <p>  Employers have to make decisions on the ongoing viability of their firms in real time and having regard to real circumstances &ndash; particularly in  circumstances where revenues have collapsed for many firms.   Directors of firms have, under company law provisions, very serious and personal responsibilities to ensure that they can continue to trade and not trade whilst insolvent.  </p>  <p>  Finally and this is important for employees who may be in a position to negotiate a redundancy package with the many genuine employers in our economy - if a company is restricted from making employees redundant and has to retain them on payroll, the assets of that company will dissipate and mean that any negotiated redundancy package has less chance of success.</p></reply>

If a person has lost their employment and the employer is no longer paying the persons&rsquo;s wages, they may qualify for the COVID-19 Pandemic UnemploymentPayment.</p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, published by the Government on 1 May 2020 sets out a timetable for the phased reopening of society and the economy and envisages a series of steps which will lead to the resumption of various sectors of the economy.  As this situation continues to evolve, decisions regarding the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, including eligibility, will be taken having regard to a range of factors including how the public health situation evolves which is being carefully monitored.</p>  <p>  The Government has asked employers to be flexible in so far as possible to allow staff time off to look after their children or other members of the family which could include offering compassionate leave, working from home, altering shifts so that someone is available to be at home when a parent is working, rearranging holidays or allowing paid time off which can be worked back at a later time. </p>  <p>  Where parents have to continue to work and they are unable to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees may access some statutory entitlements which include paid Force Majeure Leave, Parents Leave together with Parents Benefit, for each parent where a baby was born after 1st November 2019 or unpaid Parental Leave. </p>  <p>  If a person is immune suppressed and is unable to work in view of the fact that they are more susceptible to contracting the COVID-19 virus they may apply for illness benefit which is paid at a maximum weekly personal rate of &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for qualifying adults and children.  To apply for this support a person should submit completed illness benefit claim form online or by post together with a medical certificate from their General Practitioner.</p>  <p>  Where a person, in any of the circumstances outlined by the Deputies, is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

As deputies are well aware, with the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it is regrettable that the Debenhams workers now face redundancy.  </p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.  </p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to income supports, the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment was available to the employees when they were initially temporarily laid off and continues to be paid to them while the emergency payment is in operation.  In some cases, where it was more advantageous, employees will have been awarded a Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance payment depending on their family composition and circumstances.</p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate income supports the Dublin Mid Leinster Division of my Department organised and hosted an online information session on 15/5/2020 for Debenhams employees.  The purpose of this online session was to give support to the employees during this difficult time and to provide reassurance that there is a variety of organisations and services available to them to with the ultimate aim of supporting them back to employment.  The supports and advice outlined included initial income supports, job searching, training/education options, help with CVs and/or interview preparation as well as advice on self-employment and personal finances.</p>  <p>  Information was presented by representatives of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Education and Training Boards, Jobs Clubs, the Local Enterprise Office and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p>  <p>  An invitation to the online information session was facilitated to employees through the Mandate Trade Union and Debenhams.  Approximately 230 employees viewed the information session.  Follow up information and contact details are currently being issued to any employees seeking further information or support on the options outlined. </p>  <p>  With regard to redundancy supports, entitlement to a redundancy payment is defined under the Redundancy Payments Act.  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to eligible employees.  In situations where an employer is unable to pay these entitlements due to financial difficulties or insolvency an application for payment under the Redundancy Payments Scheme may be submitted to the Department.  The Department is engaging with the liquidator with a view to progressing these redundancy applications.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The State has a comprehensive insolvency system and a network of experienced insolvency practitioners in place to quickly advise those people who may inevitably find themselves in financial difficulty.</p>  <p>  Debt resolution is one of the services that the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) provides. The ISI was established in 2013 to deal with personal insolvency and is under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. The ISI aims to return people to solvency and full participation in social and economic activity. It offers a range of debt solutions, including a regulated network of qualified professionals, that can help a person to reach a permanent debt solution with their  creditor(s). </p>  <p>   The ISI encourages anyone with serious debt issues, including those impacted by the Covid-19 crisis to visit  its dedicated website backontrack.ie.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems. As part of its free, confidential and independent service, MABS also provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.</p>  <p>  During the COVID 19 pandemic, MABS continues to offer money and debt advice service, including the Dedicated Mortgage Arrears service, to existing and new clients who may need assistance in dealing with household debt accumulated during this period.  </p>  <p>  MABS is providing its services by phone, email, post  and by videoconferencing where face to face engagement is necessary. The MABS Helpline is open Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm on 0761 07 2000. </p>  <p>  A Covid-19 live feed has been created on the MABS website to host important financial developments and how they may affect the public. A new call back and instant messaging service is also now available on the MABS.ie website where the public can request a call back from a MABS advisor. </p>  <p>  I  hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme, including exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).</p><p>Payments can be made to help with the cost of any exceptional needs and urgent needs which a person cannot reasonably be expected to meet from their income.  The habitual residence condition does not apply to ENPs and UNPs.  Decisions on such payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p><p>International students who are not eligible for other Department schemes can receive support under the ENP and UNP schemes.  This support can include financial assistance to meet the cost of food and other essential items needed to prevent hardship.

As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time. Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.</p>  <p>  In the current emergency situation the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees over a short period of time. Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.</p>  <p>   For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. </p>  <p>   The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. </p>  <p>   The extension of the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered.   In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.  The government will also have regard to the timelines set out in the Roadmap to re-open Society and Business.</p>  <p>   It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation. </p>  <p>   There are no specific guidelines in relation to exiting temporary lay-off situations, however employers are expected to keep up to date contact details of their employees in order to advise them of their date of return to work or the continuation of the lay-off.  The Workplace Relations Commission&rsquo;s Customer Service Section can provide further information in relation to the rights and obligations of employees and employers respectively under employment rights legislation and can be contacted on 1890 80 80 90.</p></reply>

This payment is payable to people of working age between 18 and up to 66 which is is consistent with other Social Protection income supports paid to working age persons. </p>  <p>  The primary State income support in respect of people who are aged 66 years or over is the State Pension &ndash; either the contributory State pension or the means-tested non-contributory pension.  People over 66 years do not pay social insurance contributions and can retain all of their State Contributory Pension if they lose employment, thus guaranteeing an income support.  People in receipt of a reduced rate of non-contributory pension who are also in receipt of an employment income may have their State pension payment increased if they lose that employment income or if it is reduced.  Recipients of State pension payments may, if they satisfy the eligibility conditions, have access to a range of supports not available to unemployed people aged under 66.  These include living alone increase, household benefits, telephone support allowance, free travel and free TV licence.  Additionally, as part of the Department&rsquo;s response to the COVID 19 emergency, the Fuel Allowance season was extended by four weeks.  </p>  <p>  In relation to seasonal workers, it would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised seasonal employment, particularly in an environment where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic.  People who are currently receiving a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including seasonal workers, who have been out of work for some time will continue to remain on this payment for the period they are entitled to it.  If their entitlement to jobseekers benefit exhausts they can apply for jobseekers allowance which is means tested. </p>  <p>  Where a person, of any age, is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support through the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, published by the Government on 1 May 2020 sets out a timetable for the phased reopening of society and the economy and envisages a series of steps which will lead to the resumption of various sectors of the economy.  Phase 1, which saw the  re-opening of a very limited range of sectors, commenced on 18 May 2020.  As the situation continues to evolve, decisions around the future of the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be taken having regard to a range of factors including how the public health situation evolves and the effects of the re-opening in Phase 1 which are being carefully monitored.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

This file includes a customer&rsquo;s PPSN, customer&rsquo;s wage payment frequency (monthly, fortnightly or weekly paid) and the date of the TWSS payment.</p>  <p>  A Covid-19 PUP application will not pay due to Revenue overlap if the date of a customer&rsquo;s last TWSS payment was within a certain period prior to the Covid-19 PUP payment date.  This is based on the customer&rsquo;s salary/wage payment frequency. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that a small number of employers, having initially registered for the TWSS are no longer paying their employees this way.  A TWSS registered employee, who is no longer engaged with the TWSS may not receive a Covid-19 payment for a period of time after the last payment run processed by their employer, as the scheme is set up to block the issuing of Covid-19 payments to avoid duplication of payments during a validation period.  This period is based on the salary payment frequency of the employee.  A person cannot receive a Covid-19 payment and a TWSS payment concurrently.</p>  <p>  According to the records of my Department, the person concerned submitted applications for a Covid-19 PUP on 08/04/2020 and 10/04/2020 respectively.  These applications were refused as according to Departmental records the employer was registered for TWSS.  I am advised that the person concerned submitted a further application for a Covid-19 payment on 28/4/2020 and this was awarded and paid on 5/5/2020 based on the validation period between her last TWSS payment at the end of March and her Covid-19 payment date.  However as the person concerned received a payment from her employer at the end of April, subsequent PUP payments failed the validation period of 32 days based on the monthly salary frequency.</p>  <p>  As a result of the difficulties encountered with the Covid-19 payment, I am advised that the person concerned received assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme and was awarded Emergency Needs Payments of &euro;350 on 16/04/2020, 23/04/2020, 30/04/2020, 20/05/2020 and 21/05/2020 respectively.

Enhancements were announced to this scheme which included an increase in the subsidy paid in respect of workers earning less than &euro;24,400 from 70% to 85% and a provision whereby employers can top-up salaries by more than 15% in order to ensure that low paid employees, many of whom are aged under 25, will receive &euro;350 per week. </p>  <p>  Any arrangements for the continuation or further adjustment of these emergency supports will be considered by Government as part of its broad based approach to management of the emergency across all sectors of the economy and society.</p>  <p>  Where a person is not eligible to receive the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or wage subsidy scheme they can apply for a jobseekers payment.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit scheme provides a social insurance contribution-based support for people who have lost work and are unable to find alternative full-time employment.  If a person does not meet the qualifying conditions of the scheme or where their benefit exhausts they may be eligible to apply for the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  The maximum weekly personal rate for both the jobseekers schemes is &euro;203.  An age related reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate of &euro;112.70 generally applies to young jobseekers aged 18-24 to incentivise them to engage in education or training to improve their chances of obtaining full time sustainable employment.  If a young jobseeker participates in education or training they can receive the maximum weekly rate of up to &euro;203.  </p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) is a work experience placement programme which is specifically targeted at young jobseekers aged 18-24 years of age who are long-term unemployed or who face barriers to employment.  This scheme continues to be available despite the current restrictions of movement and arrangements for social distancing.  Young jobseekers who participate in this scheme receive a maximum weekly payment of &euro;229.20. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

It is temporary in nature, with the duration and scope limited to tackling the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.  It was adopted at ECOFIN, and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 May 2020. </p>  <p>  Briefly, the Commission will borrow on financial markets to finance loans to Member States, allowing Member States benefit from the EU&rsquo;s strong credit rating (AAA) and low borrowing costs.  Under the proposal, SURE will provide financial assistance to Member States of up to &euro;100bn in total.  The loans are targeted to assist Member States to address sudden increases in public expenditure caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, in order to preserve employment (such as short-time work schemes and other similar measures put in place for the self-employed) and certain occupational health expenditure. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding, a number of Member States, including Ireland, have parliamentary processes to be completed before SURE can be activated.  In Ireland, while the regulation will have direct effect, primary legislation will be required in order to sign and give effect to the underpinning guarantee agreement.  Any decision to access the SURE funds is a matter, in the first instance, for the Minister for Finance.  </p></reply>

My Department is advancing a number of significant recruitment initiatives to meet the critical staffing needs of employers who are delivering essential services to our communities.  The Employer Relations Team has responded to the need to fill critical vacancies by adapting their recruitment processes to provide tailored responses to deal with the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19.  These initiatives have been advanced in collaboration with State funded training agencies and employer representative organisations.</p>  <p>  In the healthcare sector, my Department, in collaboration with Skillnet Ireland and Nursing Homes Ireland, matched 50 qualified healthcare assistants to individual nursing homes.  A further 187 people availed of online training via the Healthcare Assistant Induction Programme (HAIP).  This training programme is a new employment response to give participants a thorough grounding in the basics of healthcare.  It is delivered online over three weeks, via interactive virtual classrooms funded by Skillnet Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has worked with more than 40 employers in the horticulture sector, particularly those engaged as fruit producers, and has made over 2,400 referrals.  This is in addition to jobseekers who have contacted these employers directly as a result of the online Help2Harvest campaign.</p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) plays a critical role in the labour market activation response and in upskilling and reskilling those who have been displaced as a result of economic downturn.  Building and sustaining skills in the labour force will require a key focus as the labour market recovers, with a particular emphasis on skills which will be in demand.  </p>  <p>  SOLAS are working in partnership with officials in my Department to develop an agile response which brings together and builds on existing FET expertise and resources to provide the recently unemployed cohort with the &lsquo;Skills to Compete&rsquo; in the labour market.  The aim is to maximise an individual&rsquo;s potential for re-entry to sustainable work by developing skills, building digital capabilities and providing specific courses targeting growth sectors and occupations, and linking this to advice and supports tailored to the individual.  This initiative complements other resources and structures, such as the Regional Skills Fora, to effectively match individuals and prospective employers.  Using local labour market intelligence, responses can be adapted to meet regional needs and challenges.</p>  <p>  I have also established a Labour Market Advisory Council (LMAC) which comprises an independent group of industry leaders and labour market experts, having been originally established as the Labour Market Council in 2013.  The Advisory Council will provide advice to Government to support labour market and business recovery and  is currently developing proposals outlining the required public policy responses that will assist the retraining and re-employment of those who have been disrupted by the pandemic.</p></reply>

However, unfair selection for redundancy is regarded as an unfair dismissal under those Acts.</p>  <p>  When selecting a particular employee for redundancy, an employer is required to apply selection criteria which are reasonable and are applied in a fair manner.  Employers must follow agreed procedures when making the selection.  In instances where there is no agreed procedure in relation to selection for redundancy, the employer must act fairly and reasonably. </p>  <p>  Employment equality legislation also prohibits selection for redundancy that is based on any of the following grounds: gender, civil status, family status, age, disability, religious belief, race, sexual orientation or membership of the Traveller Community.</p>  <p>  A key issue in respect of selection for redundancy is that the selection process must be seen to be fair and non-discriminatory.  If an employee considers that he or she has been unfairly dismissed, he or she may apply to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) for a hearing by a WRC Adjudication Officer of a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007.  If the Adjudication Officer finds that the dismissal was unfair, redress can take the form of either financial compensation, re-instatement or re-engagement.</p>  <p>  Complaints can be made on an online complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.

As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work and there is a very real potential for these situations to become protracted. Under the existing provisions these lay-off and short-time situations could result in a large number of redundancies in a very short period of time. Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.</p>  <p>  In the current emergency situation the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees over a short period of time. Significant numbers of redundancies over a short period of time would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover, which in turn would create many insolvency and bankruptcy situations. This will only exacerbate the risk of further job losses. Measures to assist the ongoing attachment between employees and their employer during the crisis is important.</p>  <p>  For these reasons emergency legislation has been enacted by way of Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to mitigate against the risks to businesses outlined above and to protect for as long as possible the attachment to employment for employees. </p>  <p>The existing provisions of Section 12 have effectively been suspended during the emergency period, from 13th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, in respect of an employee who has been laid off or kept on short time due to the effects of measures required to be taken by the employer in order to comply with, or as a consequence of, Government policy to prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of infection of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Extending the end date of the emergency period is provided for in legislation and an extension is currently being considered.  In considering whether the end date will be extended, the Government will have regard to the principles which are set out in Section 29 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and in particular the need to mitigate against the increased risk of insolvencies in the event of mass redundancies over a short period of time resulting in permanent job losses.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that an employees&rsquo; right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay off or short-time work has not been removed, rather it has been deferred for a temporary period in this emergency situation. </p></reply>

With this in mind, a public consultation on the design of the TCA was launched on the 28th May 2018.  A wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited to this launch.

The payment is made up of a personal rate and extra amounts for a qualified adult and any child dependents.  </p><p>Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions.</p><p>In general, the social welfare system operates on the principle of one payment per person.  There are some exceptions to the multiple payments rule in the case of the Blind Pension.  Where a person is under age 66 and satisfies the relevant conditions, they may also qualify for the following short-term social welfare payments:</p><p>- Adoptive Benefit</p><p>- Half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance</p><p>- Health and Safety Benefit</p><p>- Illness Benefit</p><p>- Injury Benefit</p><p>- Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit</p><p>- Maternity Benefit</p><p>- One-Parent Family Payment (until youngest child is 16)</p><p>- Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or  Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory and Non-Contributory Pension</p><p>Any change to these arrangements would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.</p><p>It is important to note that a blind or visually impaired person may also apply for Blind Welfare Allowance (BWA).  The Blind Welfare Allowance is a means-tested payment from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to people who are blind or visually impaired.

The purpose of this is to maintain the policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it most. </p><p>The assessment of means can vary from scheme to scheme depending on the nature and purpose of the scheme.  Sometimes a certain amount of income, or income from particular sources, is not taken into account for a particular scheme.  This is known as an income disregard. </p><p>There is an earnings disregard in place for recipients of Disability Allowance which allows them to earn up to &euro;120 per week and retain their full payment, while only half of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed in the means test.  This aims to achieve a balance between ensuring resources are targeted towards those with the greatest need while supporting people to take up employment opportunities.</p><p>In addition, Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system as the first &euro;50,000 of capital (e.g. savings, shares, property) is disregarded in the capital means test.  This compares to &euro;20,000 for most other social assistance schemes. </p><p>Any changes to the disregards or the income thresholds of social welfare schemes would have cost implications and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p></reply>

The conditions for receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are that a person must be of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have been in employment immediately before 13th March and have lost their income from employment.  A student who satisfies these conditions, including an international student, is eligible for this payment.</p>  <p>  Where a student was due to take up an internship or seasonal work but was not actually in employment they would not be eligible to receive the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  It would be impossible to construct a scheme based on claims of potential or prospective but unrealised employment, particularly in an environment where the economy was operating at full-employment with many unfilled vacancies prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Where a student is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  In order to access this support, a Personal Public Services Number (PPSN) is required.  The Department has temporarily postponed the SAFE registration process, carried out in local offices of the Department, in respect of people applying for a Personal Public Services Number (PPSN).  This decision was taken in order to comply with guidelines in respect of social distancing.  As a result of the postponement of the SAFE process, an email and postal service has now been introduced.  Detailed information on this service is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Working Family Payment is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  The estimated annual expenditure on Working Family Payment in 2019 is approximately &euro;397.2 million.  As of April 2020 the support is paid to approximately 51,793 in respect of some 116,275 children.</p>  <p>  Customers who are in receipt of Working Family Payment and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment are considered to be meeting the eligibility requirements of Working Family Payment in this situation and their payment is not ceased at this time.</p>  <p>  It important that Working Family Payment does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  The longer term goal of Working Family Payment, as an incentive to take up and remain in work, could be compromised if the nature of the work taken up is not sustainable.</p>  <p>  There are a number of supports currently available from the Department in cases where an individual may not be eligible for Working Family Payment include the Short Term Work Support and Jobseekers Allowance, which allows an individual to work up to three days without losing their benefit.  For individuals who have lost their employment entirely they may apply for the Covid Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  Details of all of the supports available from my Department and how to apply for them can be found at www.gov.ie </p>  <p>  Reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement for Working Family Payment would also have significant expenditure implications which are difficult to quantify and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The conditions for receipt of this payment are that a person must be of working age between 18 and up to 66 years old, have been in employment immediately prior to 13th March and have lost their employment income.  Employees who satisfy these conditions, which can include those in meat processing or students, are eligible to the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment if they satisfy these conditions. </p>  <p>  Where an employee has had their hours reduced and is unemployed for 4 days or more in a week they can apply for the social-insurance based jobseekers benefit or the means tested jobseeker's allowance scheme.  If they have been put on a short time working week on a temporary basis they may be eligible for short time work support. </p>  <p>  If a person in employment is diagnosed with COVID 19 they can apply for COVID 19 illness benefit.  A person who is a probable source of infection of COVID 19 and is self-isolating can also apply for COVID 19 Illness Benefit as they will have either been certified by their doctor or will have received text notification from the HSE where they have been contact-traced or otherwise personally identified and advised by the HSE as being a probable source of infection.</p>  <p>  Where a person does not qualify for these payments and is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for financial support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

With the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the measures we have had to take in response to the spread of Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it must be difficult for Debenhams workers to now face redundancy.  I applaud their efforts to ensure that they get the best outcome possible from the situation.  I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months. </p>  <p>  Once a company becomes insolvent and enters into a court supervised liquidation process the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is obliged by law to make statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees.  Payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund.  When such payments are made I,  as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, become a preferential creditor in the liquidation process and a dedicated debt management unit in the Department will engage with the liquidator in relation to any possible recovery of the debt.  </p>  <p>  The other matters raised in the question relate to company law provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation. </p></reply>

As deputies are well aware, with the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the economic turmoil caused by Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it is regrettable that the Debenhams workers now face redundancy.  </p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department. </p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.</p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.  Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.  A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.  I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. </p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.  As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.  Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. </p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer.  </p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  We will ensure that the statutory redundancy entitlement which is laid out in legislation will be paid.</p>  <p>  My officials inform me that the notification and consultation requirements of that Act, as they are construed, have also been complied with.</p>  <p>  The employee representatives are aware that there are other avenues of recourse outside seeking ministerial intervention and I hope they consider their options in that regard.  </p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, 2003 offers significant protection to fixed term workers and the purpose of this legislation is:</p>  <p>  1. to ensure that fixed term workers are afforded no less favourable treatment than their comparable permanent counterparts and   </p>  <p>  2. to prevent employers from abusing employees by employing them on a series of successive short fixed term contracts, rather than offering them a permanent one. </p>  <p>  An employee who has worked continuously for at least 104 weeks under a fixed-term or specified purpose contract may qualify for a redundancy payment when the contract ends.  In order for any permanent employee to qualify for redundancy they also require the same service so there is no distinction under the Fixed Term Work Act.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This measure effectively suspends the provisions of Section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) which relate to the rights of an employee to claim a redundancy entitlement from their employer after temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work during the Covid-19 emergency period. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately in situations where a company is insolvent and a liquidator has been appointed by the court, the reality is that employees will be made redundant by their employer.  I have no statutory power to intervene in such court supervised liquidations which is governed by company law.   My Department provides a safety net for employees in these situations and statutory redundancy payments and other wage related entitlements can be made from the Social Insurance Fund.</p></reply>

The scheme provides short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Covid emergency response approximately 6,500 have been provided rent supplement.  There are currently 1,873 applications awaiting a decision.  I am advised by my Department that statistics in relation to overall approval/refusal rates in relation to the Scheme are not currently available.</p>  <p>   In the context of the Covid emergency, for persons to be eligible for Rent Supplement, once it has been confirmed that they are a genuine (bona fide) tenant the two principle qualification criteria apply:</p>  <p>  - The customer was in receipt of Rent Supplement in the last 12  months before the date of application; or,</p>  <p>  - The customer was living in private rented accommodation prior to the Covid emergency (at least 4 weeks), could afford their rent at the beginning of the tenancy and were now unable to continue to pay the rent because of a substantial change in their circumstances. </p>  <p>  As part of the pandemic response, given the expected high level of new applications over a short time period, and to ensure customers' needs were being met as efficiently as possible, a revised 5-page application form was introduced.</p>  <p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information including confirmation of the applicant&rsquo;s income, tenancy documentation and rent details. For the vast majority of cases most applications can be processed within 2/3 days of receipt of the application where the necessary information has been provided and the application form completed appropriately. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a concern in relation to processing times in a particular area or in respect of an individual, if he provides this detail, my Department will follow up and provide appropriate feedback. I am satisfied that the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with these applications continue to make every effort to ensure rent supplement applications are processed efficiently and in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Jobseekers benefit (self-employed) was one of the measures I introduced in late 2019 which is available for self-employed people who have ceased trading.

SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, I launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019.

Section 19 of those Acts provides that in setting a rent under a tenancy of a dwelling, the rental amount shall not exceed market rent. In a Rent Pressure Zone, a rent increase restriction of 4% per annum applies. </p><p>With effect from 27 March 2020, new emergency measures were introduced into law to protect tenants during the COVID-19 emergency period. Rent increases are prohibited and tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation, other than in exceptional circumstances, during the COVID-19 emergency period. Initially, these emergency laws will last for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>recognised that rental inflation is the most significant challenge to security of tenure in the rental sector. To address this, the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 provided for Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) to moderate the rate of rent increases in those areas of the country where rents are highest and rising quickly. Currently, almost 73% of approximately 364,000 tenancies in the private rental sector are covered by RPZ designations and benefit from the rent increase restriction of 4% p.a. </p><p>In order to support more robust enforcement of the RPZ regime, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) with additional powers and resources to carry out investigations and sanction landlords, if required, for any contravention of the 4% rent increase restriction in RPZs.</p><p>Ultimately, the most effective way to make rents more affordable in the medium to long term is to increase supply and accelerate delivery of housing for the private and social rental sectors. The Government is tackling housing affordability in a number of ways to help ensure that people can provide themselves with a home - whether for rent or purchase.  </p><p>Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other major urban centres are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the establishment of a cost rental sector in Ireland. Cost rental is housing where rents only cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. Cost rental lacks the profit margin involved in the private rental sector and rents are not set by the market according to supply and demand. Cost Rental represents a new form of rental tenure for Ireland and a new State intervention into the rental market.</p><p>A working group on cost rental involving my Department, the Land Development Agency (LDA), the Housing Agency, and other stakeholders, is developing the policy framework for a broad cost rental model and examining how a sustainable financing structure can be established to deliver cost rental units at the necessary scale. Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for cost rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work. The Group's work will also be assisted by support, including in relation to research, which is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on the Group's behalf. The EIB has extensive international experience in affordable housing and is providing technical assistance in assessing the potential market for cost rental in Ireland. </p><p>Cost rental work is also being supported by two pilot projects, at the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown. The latter of these has already commenced construction, supported by EIB funding, and the first homes are anticipated to come on stream from 2021. Additionally, the LDA and some local authorities are actively considering cost rental as an option for sites within their land portfolios.  An example of this can be seen in the planning application which has been submitted for lands at Shanganagh in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown, where the LDA is working in partnership with the County Council to deliver over 350 cost rental homes.</p><p>The selection of further sites for cost rental consideration will be informed by emerging policy and by the financial and operational model that will develop from the evidence building that is currently underway.</p><p>The Government has also introduced a number of affordability measures to support people who wish to purchase their own homes. In particular, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, introduced with effect from 1 February 2018, enables credit-worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>Additionally, the Help To Buy (HTB) incentive, announced in Budget 2017 and set to run until the end of 2021, is designed to assist first-time buyers with the deposit required to purchase or self-build a new house or apartment to live in as their home. The incentive provides for a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (D.I.R.T.) paid over the previous 4 tax years, limited to a maximum of 5% of the purchase value. The HTB refund is capped at &euro;20,000. As of 30 April  2020, a total of 18,854 HTB claims have been made, of which 18,207 are approved. The estimated total value of approved HTB claims to date is in the order of &euro;271.4 million. </p><p>Increasing the supply of new homes at affordable prices is a key pillar of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan. Under Rebuilding Ireland, the Government introduced the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). The objective of the LIHAF is to provide public off-site infrastructure to relieve infrastructure blockages, thereby enabling the accelerated delivery of housing in Dublin and in other urban areas in high demand. Funding of &euro;200m has been allocated across 30 projects over the period to 2021 and work is underway to deliver the infrastructure with an associated housing delivery of up to 20,000 units. About 40% of these homes will be sold at rates which provide a discount on market prices. More than 3,000 will be social housing homes and the remainder will be sold at market rates. </p><p>In addition, &euro;310m is also available under the Serviced Sites Fund over the period to 2021 for infrastructure works on local authority lands that will support the delivery of housing for rent or purchase at rates which provide a significant discount on open market costs. Two calls for proposals have been made to date, which have resulted in &lsquo;Approval in Principle&rsquo; being given for an allocation of c. &euro;127m in funding for 35 projects, which will deliver some 3,200 more affordable homes. It is anticipated that a further call for proposals will issue in 2020. </p></reply>

Local Authorities were invited to submit their bids for the funding of schemes or projects in their functional areas.  Galway County Council made a number of bids under Measure 4 &ndash; New Group Water Schemes &ndash; including a proposal for the project referred to.  In addition to the proposed new group water scheme, the proposed project also involves amalgamation with a small existing group water scheme. The estimated cost of the proposed 229 house project was &euro;3.98 million or &euro;17,393 per house. </p>  <p>  The Framework document, issued with the bids circular last year, sets out the following levels of grant aid for the various components of work envisaged under projects:  </p>  <p>  - New Group Water Schemes: Grants of up to 85% of cost are available subject to a maximum grant of &euro;7,650 per house. This means that the effective cost limit per house is &euro;9,000. A supplemental grant is payable for new group water schemes in exceptional cases which are subject to the recommendation of the Expert Panel appointed to examine the bids and Departmental approval.</p>  <p>  - Amalgamation of Group Water Schemes: Works to achieve amalgamation of schemes (interconnections, new sources and water treatment, and essential water conservation and network upgrading to achieve amalgamation etc.) is funded at 100%.</p>  <p>  The project was approved in principle, based on the recommendations of an Expert Panel established to consider proposals, when the approvals for the multi-annual programme were announced last October. This was not accompanied by a funding allocation as the Panel recommended that the estimated cost needed to be significantly reduced.  Galway County Council made a detailed resubmission to my Department in relation to the project on 30 April 2020.  The details of the resubmission are currently being reviewed and it is hoped that a decision will be made shortly. </p></reply>

In reviewing rent limits, the Department worked closely with the DEASP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre. The new rent limits set in the Regulations involved reflected significant increases on previous limits, in the order of 60% in some areas.</p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households faces in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.</p><p>At end 2019, 42.7% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefiting from the additional flexibility. When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin region is removed, 36.0% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 16.6% above rent limits provided. This increases to 22.5% when the Dublin region homeless area data is included.  Wicklow County Council used discretion in 28.3% of HAP tenancies and the average level of discretion applied by Wicklow County Council was 16.5%.</p><p>HAP rent limits are kept under constant review, as is the use of discretion by local authorities, and the data indicates that there is no need to increase the rent limits at this time. I am also conscious that any such increase could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>I am satisfied that the current maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme. However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

However, in respect of the more affordable/cost reduced homes, Kildare County Council has advised that, in relation to the 150 homes linked tothe Naas LIHAF project, the relevant Development Agreement provided for a cost reduction of &euro;7,500 per unit on the open market value.  As part of the Oldtown/Mooretown project,  Fingal County Council has confirmed that the agreement provides that in addition to 10% social housing, the open market value of remaining units would have a cost reduction on open market values of &euro;2,500.</p><p>In respect of Part V homes generally, the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires that 10% of any development be made available for social housing.  Local authorities will ensure adherence to statutory obligations and the sites in question will deliver on this requirement in the overall period up to completion.  In some cases, the required level of 10% will be exceeded.

Irish Water is continuing to invest in solving the remaining priority issues, with a particular focus on improving the reliability and resilience of our public water system. </p>  <p>  I also recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s private supplies, which serve up to a fifth of our population, must be appropriately protected and improved.  This forms a core objective of the Government's investment in rural water supplies and forms part of the review of rural water services that is currently underway.  Sustained investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public and private water sector is essential.</p>  <p>  On 19 July 2018, the European Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice to Ireland citing 73 public drinking water supplies and 24 private group water schemes each with elevated concentrations of a group of disinfection by-product chemicals called trihalomethanes (THMs). These chemicals are formed during disinfection when raw waters have high levels of natural organic material.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s response to the Letter of Formal Notice on 19 October 2018 highlighted plans for investment to resolve this issue in each supply by upgrading and improving treatment processes and outlined the significant progress that had already been made in addressing excess THM formation in both public and private water supplies. This was followed up by a further progress report to the Commission in May 2019.  On 14 May 2020, the Commission escalated the infringement and issued a &lsquo;Reasoned Opinion&rsquo; to Ireland regarding a failure to fulfil obligations under Articles 4 of Directive 98/83/EC on drinking water.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 Letter of Formal Notice had raised the issue of informing, advising and notifying consumers under Article 8(3) and (7) of the Drinking Water Directive.  The Commission has decided, having assessed Ireland&rsquo;s reply, to not to pursue allegations under these provisions in the Reasoned Opinion.</p>  <p>  The Commission now states Ireland has infringed the requirements of the Directive in relation to 31 public water supplies and in 13 private group water schemes, with regard to elevated concentrations of THMs, failing to take remedial action as soon as possible, and failing to give priority to its enforcement action.</p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s Remedial Action List for public water supplies is published on a quarterly basis.  The most recent update relates to Q1 2020, and shows that of the 31 public water supply zones named in the Reasoned Opinion, a further 13 are now compliant with the THM parameters.  Information in relation to the status of the private group water schemes is currently being compiled in my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with Irish Water, the EPA, local authorities and the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to develop a comprehensive reply to the Reasoned Opinion, outlining the progress already made and a programme of works to address excess THMs in the remaining 18 water supply zones and the private group water schemes in the shortest practicable timeframe.  </p>  <p>  Irish Water continues to develop and implement a long-term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and waste water system.  Building water and waste water treatment plants, as well as upgrading or building new water and waste water networks, requires significant and sustained investment.  The National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides for significant investment in public water and wastewater infrastructure over the course of the plan to ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of Ireland&rsquo;s water and waste water infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and ensure compliance with EU Directives.  </p></reply>

The exact blend of delivery under leasing in any given year will depend on the availability of existing stock and new homes in particular. Leasing is funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), which also meets the current costs of dwellings delivered by approved housing bodies under the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and Housing Agency Acquisitions Programmes. There is no Lease to Buy scheme in the Department's leasing programme. </p><p>Data in relation to the 1,161 leased dwellings delivered in 2019, broken down by local authority and lease type, is published on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>Details of the average annual cost of each lease type are set out in the Table below. The average cost is calculated based on claims for operational new units submitted by local authorities and recorded on my Department&rsquo;s SHCEP financial management system at end 2019. No payments were made by my Department for Enhanced Leasing units in 2019 but the estimated average annual lease cost for 2020 for the 113 units delivered under the Enhanced Leasing Scheme is &euro;22,221.  </p><p><b>Table: Average Lease Cost 2019 by Lease Type</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Average Annual Cost by Lease Type</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LA lease from private owner </td>       <td>&euro;10,696</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AHB Lease from private owner</td>       <td>&euro;8,349</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MTR (AHB and Private)</td>       <td>&euro;10,144</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NAMA SPV</td>       <td>&euro;16,726</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>RLS (LA and AHB)</td>       <td>&euro;5,666</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department does not carry out Net Present Cost (NPC) calculations for different lease types as a whole in any particular year. This is because lease duration will have a strong impact on the calculation and, of the 1,161 leases referred to above, there are varying lease terms. In addition, many of the projects are located in areas that have different cost and income inputs attached and all have varying degrees of operational risk and responsibility attached.  NPC calculations are used to examine competing options for a specific project or investment on specific sites, and are not deemed applicable as a comparator across multiple lease types on very different sites.</p></reply>

Having reflected on the views of the Review Group on the rate of activation of SHD sites, it is considered appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner, given the efficiencies that the SHD arrangements provide.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, I indicated that I considered that it would be appropriate to introduce a "use it or lose it" measure requiring developers to have commenced a certain level of development within a certain period of time on foot of a grant of an SHD planning permission. My Department has been developing proposals in this regard, the further advancement of which will be considered in context of the legislative programme of the incoming Government.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised fire stations, an upgrade of the communications and mobilisation system and improvements to training centres. </p>  <p>  In order to maximise the Capital Programme funding available, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the capital programme on an annual basis and priority may be adjusted to bring forward more advanced projects offering best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects in the programme more generally. </p>  <p>  My Department runs a national training programme for fire services which provides an annual programme of courses for local authority fire service officers, supporting fire authorities in delivering efficient and effective fire and rescue services. The programme is delivered through a number of regional training centres and this has proved to be an effective and efficient approach over many years. My Department continues to support capital developments in these regional training centres and regards them as a more effective service delivery model rather than a single dedicated site, considering the fire service training needs, numbers of personnel and geographical considerations across the country . There are currently no plans to develop a national training centre.</p>  <p>  I understand that Limerick City and County Council has acquired a large industrial site adjacent to the fire station in Kilmallock with plans to develop a training centre there. My Department has requested a detailed proposal from the Council. </p></reply>

Tenants cannot be forced to leave their rental accommodation, other than in exceptional circumstances, during this period. Initially, these emergency laws will apply for a period of 3 months, but they may be extended if the Government considers it necessary. </p><p>My Department recently published a Guidance Document on Covid-19 supports for landlords and tenants which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period. The Guidance document is available at:</p><p> </p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p>. </p><p>The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2019 provide for minimum notice periods to be served by tenants and landlords for tenancy terminations &ndash; for example, a student must provide 28 days notice to end a tenancy of less than 6 months duration or 35 days to end a tenancy of more than 6 months but less than 1 year. </p><p>The Acts do not prescribe specific terms and conditions regarding the payment of rents or deposits for inclusion in individual letting agreements in the private rental market including the student-specific accommodation sector. Contract law governs such arrangements.</p><p>The specific terms associated with an individual student&rsquo;s rights and obligations are likely to be set out in a written contract signed by both the student and the landlord. Engagement between the parties to clarify the respective contractual obligations of the student and the landlord is key in establishing whether a breach of contract had occurred.</p><p>Students may wish to contact their third level education providers to seek any assistance that they might be in a position to provide. If a student cannot come to an agreement with their accommodation provider, they might wish to contact the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) regarding their concerns &ndash; https://www.rtb.ie/&ndash; or to refer a dispute for resolution with regard to the non-refund of their deposit. </p><p>The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to comment on or intervene in the specifics of any individual case, or to meet with anyone that may be party to a dispute lodged with the RTB. </p><p>I understand that the Department of Education and Skills is working with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. The Department of Education of Skills understands, based on the information available to it, that the majority of students in university-owned accommodation will receive pro-rata refunds if they vacate their accommodation.  The Minister for Education and Skills has indicated that he would wish to see this principle applied in the case of students who were residing in privately owned student accommodation. However, it is not within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills nor of my Department to direct any accommodation provider to offer a refund.</p></reply>

This is, in effect, what is often colloquially referred to as a grandfather clause.</p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor. Mr Fennell&rsquo;s report on the matter is available on my Department's website at the following link: . The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht also examined the matter and published its Report on the Title of Architect (July 2013) which is available at: </p><p>Both reports, which were welcomed by my Department, made a number of recommendations intended to improve and streamline the arrangements for registration. Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented, which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons. My Department and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.</p><p>In addition to the transitional &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision set out above, section 14(2)(f) of the Act provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. In 2016, the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section. While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination. Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended). For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.</p><p>Under EU law there is no harmonised standard of competence for architecture; however 11 competencies are specified under Article 46 of <i>Directive 2005/36/EC on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications</i>.  The standard of education and professional practice requirements varies across Member States.  Section 14(5) of the Building Control Act 2007 requires that training programmes and qualifications relating to architecture must however relate to the Article 46 competencies.</p><p>The <i>Irish Standard of Knowledge, Skill and Competence for Practice as an Architect</i>was developed in 2005 by the RIAI, in consultation with industry stakeholders.  It is included in the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) maintained by Quality &amp;amp; Qualifications Ireland (QQI).</p><p>My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made. I would encourage all practically trained persons to pursue the routes to registration which are open to them and to continue to engage constructively with my Department and the RIAI.</p></reply>

This was done to maintain the integrity of the planning system and to ensure that public participation requirements therein are not diminished.</p>  <p>  The expiration of the third Order on 23 May 2020 means that a planning authority will have the normal period of 8 weeks, together with an additional period of up to 8 weeks, i.e. up to 16 weeks in total, to determine a planning application. The Orders also mean that an interested person will have the normal period of 5 weeks, together with an additional period of up to 8 weeks, i.e. up to 13 weeks in total, to participate in the process in relation to planning applications.  The exact calculation of the extended time period will depend on the date a planning application is submitted and the stage of the process it is at.</p>  <p>  During the period of the three Orders, An Bord Pleanala (the Board) has remained open for business, accepting applications, appeals and observations. The Board has continued to make decisions regarding Strategic Infrastructure Developments, Strategic Housing Developments (where for example, it made decisions on 11 cases in April 2020, the same number of decisions as in the corresponding month in 2019, ensuring that decisions were made in all cases within the mandatory 16 week decision timeline), vacant site levy appeals and normal planning appeals where the public participation process involved was complete prior to the making of the first Order under section 251A of the Planning Act. </p>  <p>  Following on from the Government's Roadmap for Re-Opening Society and Business published on 1 May last, and the subsequent resumption of activity in the construction sector from 18 May last under Phase 1 of the Roadmap, I decided not to recommend to Government the further extension of the recent COVID-19 related Orders under section 251A of the Planning Act. This has enabled the re-opening of planning authority offices and the phased resumption of planning operations in accordance with public health guidance and relevant return to work protocols from earlier this week i.e. 25 May. </p>  <p>  In light of this, decision making processes under the planning system, including those requiring public participation, are now beginning to be advanced again. </p>  <p>  My Department has worked with planning authorities and An Bord Pleanala during the period of the COVID-19 restrictions with a view to ensuring that work was progressed on planning files to the fullest extent possible, thereby facilitating the smooth resumption and delivery of planning services on return to work and minimising the build-up of any backlogs. The Board has not indicated the necessity for any additional resources at this time.</p></reply>

A number of further Orders were made subsequently, the combined effect of which meant that such periods were ultimately extended in duration from 29 March 2020 to 23 May 2020 inclusive, comprising a total period of eight weeks (56 days).</p>  <p>  While it was decided not to further extend the Section 251A Order after 23 May, the additional period of eight weeks carries forward into all statutory planning processes and is applicable to county development plans.</p>  <p>  The agreed programme between my Department and the City &amp;amp; County Management Association (CCMA) for the phased re-establishing of local authority services has identified county/city development plan activities as restarting in Phase 4 of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  Accordingly, a majority of planning authorities now intend commencing or re-commencing their statutory development plan preparation processes, subject to the extended eight week period, resulting in a series of new public consultation and plan display exercises from late Summer and into the Autumn. </p>  <p>  The county/city development plan procedure includes public participation as a central part of the plan-making process with specified requirements for public display and consultation. Planning authorities engage with the public through a wide range of different channels and media, including written documentation and submissions, online content and face-to-face forums which often build on established business and community engagement activities and networks. </p>  <p>  As part of these public participation exercises, there is a statutory requirement to hold public meetings at the initial county/city development plan consultation stage. While such events can involve large public meetings at a limited number of venues, more recent practices have centred around a workshop format where individuals in small groups can more easily and comfortably have the opportunity to articulate their opinion and to contribute to the plan making process.</p>  <p>  A specific Working Group has been convened by my Department and the CCMA to examine the particular COVID-19 issues impacting on the operation of the planning system.  This Working Group has met on a number of occasions in relation to the reopening of planning services in a manner that is in accordance with public health restrictions and also provides for public participation. This work has initially concentrated on the development management function, relating to planning applications and associated services. </p>  <p>  The Working Group will subsequently be focusing on issues concerning the preparation of statutory development plans by the local authorities, including county/city development plans. It is intended that this will inform the local government sector in fulfilling statutory and administrative obligations in the development plan process in a manner that is both safe and accessible. </p></reply>

The members of that BRAB were appointed for a term of office of five years from 14 June 2007 to 13 June 2012.  A temporary extension to 1 October 2012 was granted to the existing members in light of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations which were at an advanced stage of development at that time.</p><p>In accordance with Appendix IIb of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in November 2011, the BRAB was listed as one of the forty six &ldquo;Candidate Bodies for Critical Review by end June 2012&rdquo;.  The outcome of that review process was that the work of the Building Regulations Advisory Body was to be absorbed into my Department. I have no plans to establish a new BRAB at this time. </p><p>In relation to Ireland&rsquo;s evacuation policy, the Fire Safety Task Force established in the aftermath of the Grenfell tragedy, in its report of May 2018, highlights evacuation of buildings as the default policy in Ireland.  This is distinctly different from the &ldquo;stay put&rdquo; policy in other countries. The Report also states &ldquo;The key to life safety in all apartment buildings is a proper two-stage fire detection and alarm system, together with an evacuation strategy&hellip;&rdquo;.</p><p>In regard to the recent changes to the Building Regulations technical guidance document for fire safety, Part B and Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B of the Building Regulations deal with fire safety issues.  Part B of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations sets the legal performance requirements of buildings and the associated TGD B provides guidance on how to achieve that performance for common building types.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the guidance in TGD B, this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. </p><p>The design of apartments in Ireland has been evolving over recent years, as design teams learn from best practice around the world. In particular, open plan apartments are becoming increasingly popular. TGD B 2006 did not provide specific guidance on open plan apartment arrangements. In 2018, following liaison with Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB), a working group of experts from DFB and my Department was set up to examine the issue of open plan apartments in Ireland and develop appropriate guidance.</p><p>All proposed changes to the Building Regulations or amendments to TGDs are formally notified to the European Commission and are subject to a public consultation process and a Regulatory Impact Analysis. The recent additional guidance to TGD B 2006 is no different, in that a draft was published for public consultation from 23 June 2019 to 23 August 2019. </p><p>A significant number of submissions were received from individuals, fire safety consultants, housing providers, other organisations and local authorities. My Department carefully evaluated all 39 submissions received, which included approximately 400 comments.  In addition, a number of meetings took place with stakeholders such as local authority fire officers, fire safety consultants and construction industry stakeholders.  </p><p>In developing the additional guidance, standards, tests and engineering approaches were considered and fire safety requirements in a number of jurisdictions, including England, Scotland, the USA, Australia, Denmark and Hong Kong, were reviewed.  </p><p>The additional guidance amending TGD B 2006 published in February 2020 has a number of provisions for buildings containing apartments and includes a new section specifying provisions for open plan apartments.  In relation to internal layouts and provisions for open plan apartments with travel distances exceeding 9m, the guidance provides for -</p><p>- sprinkler protection within the apartment to control fire development; </p><p>- maximum travel distances within the apartment of 20m; </p><p>- single storey apartments only;</p><p>- an enhanced fire detection and alarm systems within the apartment;</p><p>- interconnected alarms in circulation areas, bedrooms and high risk areas to ensure early detection and warning of a fire; and </p><p>- enclosed kitchens or a distance of 1.8m from the main kitchen cooking appliances to the escape route, which is in line with international research and testing. </p><p>For smaller apartments, with travel distances less than or equal to 9m, the guidance in TGD B has not changed. TGD B has referenced BS 5588 Part 1: 1990 since the introduction of Building Regulations in 1991, and this continues to be applicable. In these apartments, the travel distances from the apartment entrance door to any point in any habitable room cannot exceed 9m, no habitable room can be an inner room, and the position of any cooking facilities should be remote from the dwelling entrance door and not prejudice the escape route from any point in the apartment. This typically applies to small studio type flats with open internal layouts. </p><p>The additional guidance provides that an escape route from a bedroom cannot be through a kitchen in a non-sprinklered apartment, as no habitable room can be an inner room in accordance with BS 5588 Part 1: 1990, as currently referenced in TGD B. Furthermore, the existing provisions of BS 5588-1:1990 clearly indicate that escape from flats with a floor more than 4.5m above ground level should be via common protected corridors/lobbies and protected stairways, not via escape windows. While this does not consider windows to be suitable for escape, it does not preclude the use of windows for rescue. </p><p>It should be noted that the additional guidance also addresses other aspects of fire safety for buildings containing apartments and this is set out at the beginning of reprint TGD B 2020.  All of the guidance in TGD B (Reprint 2020) should be considered collectively, as fire safety must be addressed in a holistic manner, considering building resilience and ensuring a building is safe for occupant egress and firefighter operations simultaneously.</p><p>Technical Guidance Document B - Fire Safety (2006) (Reprint 2020) and a Background Note on Recent Changes to Part B and TGD B of the Building Regulations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

It is a matter for each local authority to identify the appropriate initiatives to respond to identified housing need.  This includes consideration of options to build, acquire or lease properties, as well as the provision of housing supports through the private rental sector, including through the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is, in the first instance, a matter for the local authority concerned, in accordance with its allocation scheme made in accordance with section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and its associated Regulations.</p>  <p>  RAS has been an important contributor to social housing supply since its introduction on a pilot basis in 2005.  RAS involves a three-way relationship between (1) the housing authority and landlord - where the local authority enters into a contractual arrangement with the property owner to make the property available to the housing authority under the RAS scheme for an agreed term and at an agreed rent; (2) the landlord and tenant - where the eligible RAS tenant, nominated by the housing authority, signs a residential tenancy agreement with the landlord; and (3) the housing authority and tenant - where the RAS tenant pays a differential rent to the local authority and the local authority makes payments to the landlord on the tenant's behalf.  The availability agreement signed by the landlord and the local authority sets out the commencement date for that agreement and would therefore be the date from which rent is payable to the landlord by the local authority, subject to all conditions of the availability agreement being complied with. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy can provide additional information in relation to any particular form of delay that he is concerned about, I will endeavour to have the matter explored further. </p></reply>

Alongside the establishment of the LDA in September 2018, the Government approved a new public land affordability requirement.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-27a.3024.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1554" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700168#WRQQQ01400"><p>As most construction sites only commenced remobilisation from 18 May 2020,  in light of the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, it is too early estimate with any accuracy the potential costs of the safe working practices required in line with the Return to Work Safely Protocol; COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers, and their impact on the viability of housing and apartment projects.  </p>  <p>  While practically all housing relation construction activity had ceased from 27th March 2020, as the Deputy will be aware, a number of construction projects delivering urgent essential homes were activated during the period of restrictions. One of the key criteria to achieve designation under the above process was that where works were proposed, the Contractor employed by the local authority or the Approved Housing Body was required to confirm that they could undertake the works in accordance with HSE and Government COVID-19-related public health guidelines and recommendations. Another criteria was that these projects were, for the most part, practically complete, with minor final snagging, landscaping, paving and external works to be completed. </p>  <p>  The activation of these sites gave both the construction site teams and the contracting body- either the local authority or Approved Housing Body- an opportunity to practically implement some of the concepts that were being prepared across the board by the Sector working with Government on standard operating procedures and to feedback to their representative organisation. It also allowed for a level of readiness to commence other activity on non-essential sites.  While the earlier activation might also provide some slightly earlier indication of the additional costs arising,  the real impact on programmes, costs and productivity will vary from site to site and the stage of development (commencement or near completion). </p>  <p>  This view has been underscored in recent correspondence which I have received from Property Industry Ireland (PII), which indicates that it will be some time before such an exercise is possible, and noting that the sector is very conscious of the impact of any increase in costs on its competitiveness and so there is an incentive for the sector to examine ways in which to minimise or reduce costs.  </p>  <p>  The Construction Sector Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in the context of the delivery of the National Development Plan, will provide a useful forum for the engagement on the wider industry impacts of COVID-19 arrangements.  This Group&rsquo;s remit includes working with industry and government bodies to benchmark and improve productivity and environmental sustainability and to modernise public works delivery. </p>  <p>  My Department has sought to support the current measures by encouraging planning authorities, where possible, to adopt a discretionary approach in relation to construction working hours conditions attached to planning permissions so as to assist the splitting of shifts for separating trades and activities required to achieve physical distancing on construction sites in accordance with relevant public health/ health and safety advice and protocols, while seeking to balance this with the need to ensure output and productivity by the sector. </p>  <p>  Within this broader frame, my Department will monitor any specific viability issues arising for the housing sector.  This is an area which my Department has actively considered in recent years and measures have been brought forward such as the standardisation of documentation and innovative production methods for social housing programmes and statutory planning guidance on building heights and apartments to improve viability by lowering costs, while ensuring a quality urban environment.  My Department will also continue to participate in Construction Sector Group discussions on wider industry issues, including productivity and innovation.</p></reply>

When the RIHL was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years. The RIHL proved to be more successful than initially anticipated and following discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, an increase in funding of &euro;363.6 million for 2018-2019 was communicated to all 31 local authorities on 15 August 2019.  Following further engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, additional funding for new RIHL lending of up to &euro;210 million has been secured for 2020.  </p><p>It is recognised that current applicants for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID-19 restrictions, including, for example, accessing financial documents; property visits and valuations; solicitors visits, etc. Therefore, local authorities are being asked to show flexibility when dealing with applicants at all stages of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan process from application through to approval, drawdown and (where relevant) appeal and should extend the time periods as necessary to accommodate those who may be experiencing difficulties arising out of COVID-19 restrictions. For existing applicants, local authorities are advised to ensure that final loan offers are made based on up to date financial and employment data from applicants, as appropriate, having regard to the implications that COVID-19 has had for many businesses and employers.</p><p>My Department publishes information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns. Local authority approval means that an official letter of offer has been sent to a borrower (and therefore relates to a specific property and loan amount). My Department does not collect information on the number of applications received, pending or refused.</p><p>Information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan for 2019, including the number and value of mortgage approvals and drawdowns, as well as average loan amounts, are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i><b>.</b></p><p>This information will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.</p><p>Information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan for 2018 is also available through this link and can be found under local authority loans approved and local authority loans paid.  However these figures are not detailed by loan type.</p></reply>

When reviewing requests such as this, my Department is required to consider the borrowing capacity for the local goverment sector, the overall priorities of Government in terms of infrastructure, regional development and local development, as well as the alignment of local authority proposals with national and local policies and plans. Of the 10 sites that formed part of the request, sanction to borrow &euro;3m was approved. </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework prioritises public investment in substantial new housing development into towns and villages, where citizens can access existing local education facilties, employment opportunities, healthcare, transport and other local services.  Approved borrowing sanctions, as indicated above, have been for housing projects in such existing towns and villages in County Clare. My Department&rsquo;s Serviced Sites Fund, supporting the development of publically owned sites for affordable housing development, similarly concentrates on established city and town areas where such existing local services and infrastructure are currently available.  </p>  <p>  The Meelick site is situated within a small residential area that is isolated from such necessary local services and has severely limited public transport. The current Clare County Development Plan also indicates that the site in question is unserviced and there is no indication or commitment that the required services for development are to be provided by Irish Water to facilitate the housing development proposed by Clare County Council.  Furthermore, the local authority's Core Strategy Population Target for Ballycannon North (Meelick) indicates a target increase in population of 124 Persons (45 Households) only, from 2011-2023.  It is not clear whether or not the current population may have already reached this target. The scale of the proposed development, at approximately 70 housing units, is inconsistent with Departmental guidelines on Sustainable Communities, which seek to provide social housing development of a scale proportionate to the size and demand in the existing local population. </p>  <p>  Given the very limited access to facilities, Clare County Council would be required to demonstrate that no other more suitable, better located sites are available within other large villages in the county. The Council would also have to demonstrate a high demand for the location in question by way of approved social housing applicants who have expressed a specific preference for Ballycannon North (Meelick). </p>  <p>  It was for these reasons that this part of the loan application has not been sanctioned.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  It is a matter for local authorities to assess the adequacy of provisions on sites (both authorised and unauthorised) and implement measures as necessary, taking into consideration advice from the HSE, fire safety guidelines, local area plans, public procurement guidelines and any other considerations relevant to their area. </p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 health emergency, I and my Department have engaged with local authorities and Traveller representative groups to put a responsive plan in place to address identified and emerging health risks to the Traveller population nationwide, particularly as some members of the Traveller community, such as those living on sites with limited facilities, may be particularly vulnerable.  On 18 March 2020, my Department wrote to each local authority in relation to measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and lessen the risk of infection to families residing in Traveller-specific accommodation. Local authorities were advised that my Department has funding available for essential mitigation works and that any such requests will be afforded full priority.  Works identified include extra toilets or temporary sanitary blocks, running water, additional accommodation where there is overcrowding, site clean-ups and extra refuse collection, and additional units on-site or elsewhere as space permits in order to allow for self-isolation/quarantine.  Many of these solutions have been, or are in the process of being, implemented on sites throughout the country and my Department has been very clear that these provisions will apply to both authorised and unauthorised sites for the duration of this crisis.</p>  <p>  My Department is in regular contact with the local authorities and is ensuring that funding approvals, where appropriate, are granted as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

This includes the potential for a &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; or &lsquo;Co-Living&rsquo; format.  This format comprises professionally managed rental accommodation, where living accommodation, that may comprise individual rooms, is rented within an overall development, that must also include access to shared or communal facilities and amenities, but not shared bathroom or toilet facilities. To end Q1 2020, 294 co-living bedspaces have been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the strategic housing development application process since the guidelines came into force in 2018.  In comparison, there were more than 60,000 homes permitted, none of which were co-living bedspaces, from when the guidelines were published to the end of 2019 alone.</p>  <p>  Shared accommodation is one of a number of residential settings that include hotels, hostels, residential institutions and student accommodation, where residential occupation comprises more than one household.  Although such accommodation formats are not as prevalent as individual houses or apartments, they nonetheless play an important role in catering for the diverse needs of the overall population. There are currently no plans to review any of these formats in light of the COVID-19 pandemic but my Department will continue to monitor existing policy measures and activities, having regard to the most up to date Government public health advice and guidance, as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.</p></reply>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also has a role in relation to the Animal Health and Welfare Act.</p>  <p>  There are currently 68 licensed zoos in the country ranging from small family-run wildlife parks to large internationally renowned zoos such as Dublin Zoo, as well as a number of mobile zoos and aquaria.</p>  <p>  Like almost all public facing businesses, zoos have been closed to the public during the current Covid-19 crisis, and the Government has a range of supports in place to assist businesses, which includes the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and a range of other business supports. </p>  <p>  In parallel with these measures, my Department is working to provide zoos with guidance and support. My Department is in contact with zoos across Ireland and with the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquaria to ensure the best possible solutions for animals and to help zoo owners continue to operate their establishments within the regulatory framework. While it has not been possible to carry out inspections due to the COVID-19 restrictions on travel and social distancing, the Department will, in so far as possible, facilitate zoos regarding licence expiry dates and meeting licence conditions. Once it is safe to do so, zoo inspections will resume. There is no licence fee charged to cover the costs associated with the inspection and licensing processes; these costs are met by the Department. </p>  <p>  In recent days, my Department has been informed by several zoos that they plan to reopen as soon as the restrictions around COVID-19 allow and are putting in place well thought out and comprehensive plans for doing so. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has published the National Return to Work Safely Protocol, which guides businesses in making their assessments and adapting their workplace procedures and practices to comply fully with the COVID-19 related public health protection measures.</p></reply>

The Declaration allowed for the shooting of wood pigeon to prevent serious damage to arable crops except for the months of June, July and August this year.  As in previous years the renewal of the Declaration was the subject of consultation with relevant stakeholders such as hunting, conservation and farming bodies as well as the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  </p><p>I made the decision at the time taking account of scientific advice provided as part of the consultation. This raised concerns about the full year inclusion in the Declaration of wood pigeon on the basis that there is limited evidence to suggest that wood pigeon cause &ldquo;serious damage&rdquo; to crops during the summer. It was submitted that there is a lack of comprehensive studies into wood pigeon damage to crops to inform the decision to allow for year-round derogations for their control. Studies of wood pigeon food preference in Ireland from 2013 have shown that in spring, the diet of wood pigeons is dominated by fruit and seeds of trees (Ivy). In summer, the diet is variable and consists of a relatively equal proportion of cereal grains, clover and weed material.  </p><p>This 2013 study further highlighted that cereal crops were only the preferred food during the autumn months (defined as August&ndash;October in the study). Based on current cropping systems, these crops were most likely consumed post-harvest i.e., harvest spillage left on stubble fields.  While the derogation is given to &lsquo;prevent serious damage to crops&rsquo; there is limited evidence to suggest &lsquo;serious damage&rsquo; to crops occurs during the summer period.  It was also indicated that shooting of wood pigeon during summer months could have indirect adverse effects on other species such as stock dove and it was recommended that there is a need to <i>&ldquo;undertake a contemporary review of the species interaction with crops with respect to damage</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>Pending such a review, and on the basis of available literature and the &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo;, I considered it appropriate at the time that the wood pigeon would be removed from the Declaration for the summer months &ndash; June, July and August 2020. </p><p>At the same time, I recognised that if wood pigeons were seen to cause damage to crops during the summer, landowners could still avail of Section 42 permits under the Wildlife Acts i.e., permits, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual species on specific lands. </p><p>Since the Declaration was signed last month I have considered the matter further in consultation with farming sector interests who raised concerns about the exclusion of the wood pigeon from the Declaration during the June to August period on the basis of damage to crop yield, damage to crops making them difficult to harvest and also faecal contamination. </p><p>In the circumstances and in light of potential damage highlighted by farming sector interests, I  took the view that consideration of changing the status quo by removing the wood pigeon from the Declaration during this year&rsquo;s summer could benefit from further information and studies.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have decided that the status quo be reinstated for the wood pigeon this year i.e., that lethal means would be available to landowners during the three summer months June, July and August to prevent crop damage. I have signed a revised Declaration to this effect. Additionally, the issue of wood pigeon damage to crops during the summer months will be examined with a view to considering this issue in the 2021/22 year. A reply will issue to all correspondence received in my office on this matter.</p></reply>

Planned new studio facilities would be a welcome addition to the existing studio infrastructure in Ireland.  Financial support to private sector infrastructure projects are subject to European State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a location for production  - both inward and indigenous - continues to grow. The Government highly values the cultural, creative and economic potential of Ireland&rsquo;s audiovisual industry, as reflected in the incorporation of &euro;200m to be invested in the industry through Screen Ireland over the 10 years to 2027 and the Audiovisual Action Plan.  Government support for the sector is also provided through the section 481 tax credit and training and skills development initiatives as part of that process have contributed to growing Ireland&rsquo;s skilled audiovisual workforce, making Ireland an attractive destination for film-making. This has given rise to an increased demand for film studio space across the country. Expansions of high quality studio space have already taken place in areas such as Troy Studios in Limerick and a number of major international projects have chosen to film on location in Ireland. While the current COVID-19 crisis has lead to the temporary cessation of live action productions, it is hoped that the easing of restrictions in the coming weeks and months will allow the resumption of work already in the pipeline. In addition, in response to the lack of production activity at this time, measures introduced by Screen Ireland to support the industry are designed to aid production companies and creative talent in developing a strong slate of quality projects, so that the industry can emerge from the current situation in a position to scale up production activity in studios across the country and respond to the global rise in demand for audiovisual content. I look forward to the development of this proposed media park in Dublin and the contribution it will make to growing the audiovisual sector in Ireland.  </p></reply>

These command very considerable resource commitments in terms of both funding and personnel. Nevertheless, in the interests of preservation, conservation, management and presentation of the built and archaeological heritage, my Department acquires certain additional heritage properties and monuments from time to time as resources and opportunities permit. These properties may come onto the open market, may be bequeathed to the State or may be offered to it free of cost.  </p>  <p>  Lands surrounding or in proximity to national monuments or heritage properties in State care often reside in private ownership. In some cases, improved protection of, or access to, the monument or property may be achieved by the State acquiring such lands. In all cases the Department examines the potential acquisition carefully, taking into account the conservation needs of the property and Value for Money principles. </p>  <p>  The monument referred to by the Deputy is a national monument in my guardianship as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Day-to-day management and maintenance of the monument is undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of, and in consultation with, my Department. It is fully protected under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-2014, and any works at or in proximity to it require Ministerial Consent under Section 14 of the 1930 Act.</p>  <p>  There are currently no proposals before my Department in relation to the acquisition of land in the vicinity of this national monument. The Department is aware though of certain issues relating to its protection and presentation and is in touch with the local authority and Office of Public Works in relation to them.  As already referred to, the purchase of an adjacent or surrounding property is among the strategies that may come to be considered for ensuring the protection of a national monument.  My Department is, however, only ever in a position to make a very limited number of such acquisitions and, for business reasons, does not publicly disclose its interest in advance of any purchase negotiations.</p></reply>

The project, run in collaboration with Dublin City University,  produces terminology in the Irish language for inclusion in the European Union&rsquo;s multilingual terminology database, IATE. The project has so far yielded 65,592 Irish IATE entries. Irish is in second place, just behind Polish, in terms of the number of IATE entries for the &lsquo;new&rsquo; post-2004 official languages.  Funding is currently in place for this project until the end of 2021.</p><p>The purpose of producing a dictionary is to mirror the vernacular and this is reflected in Foras na Gaeilge's approach to its lexicographical work, including the New English Irish Dictionary.  It is natural in any language for words from other languages to enter its lexicography and, while there are those who may wish use native words at all times, the nature of sociolinguistics is complex and evolving for all languages.  Notwithstanding this, Foras na Gaeilge has a Terminology Committee which aims to develop, approve and make available standard authoritative Irish language terminology to support Irish as a medium of communication in a modern society.

As part of its suite of responses to the COVID-19 situation, the Government issued guidance on returning to the workplace on 9th May. The 'Return to Work Safely Protocol' clearly and comprehensively sets out the steps and processes that businesses must take to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. It is a matter for all employers to ensure their workplaces are safe for staff and customers alike . I am very aware that the reopening of arts and culture venues will pose challenges for many of these organisations.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, many artists are making their work available through a range of online platforms.  In some instances this has been with support from my Department including under the Ireland Performs programme supported by Facebook and Culture Ireland. Under this initiative, 120 artists gave live performances online in recent weeks.  All of these performances were delivered using only the artists' personal devices.  In light of this, while my Department is currently examining its capital grant schemes for arts and culture organisations in the context of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, supports of the type proposed are not envisaged at present.</p></reply>

Under Section 24 (2) of the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its funding decisions and I as Minister cannot intervene in its decisions in this regard. </p><p>I understand that over the past few months, the Arts Council has taken decisions to direct its 2020 funding allocation in a way which would assist artists and arts organisations to best respond to the Covid-19 crisis.  These decisions have been taken on the back of extensive and ongoing consultation with the arts sector and other stakeholders.  Priority in the use of all funds is being given towards supporting the artists and arts workers.  </p><p>The Council has announced a new suite of programmes which include expanded bursary, commission and professional development awards designed to sustain the ecology at this difficult time, while also offering  support which enables artists to develop work and supports arts workers to enhance their skill sets.  I understand that the Arts Council had already agreed to progress  residences with Colleges of Education and with writer in residence programmes in a number of universities. </p><p>The Arts Council responded quickly to the impact of COVID-19 on the arts sector. At the start of the COVID-19 emergency, the Council introduced a series of measures to help artists and arts organisations manage their businesses during the period of the COVID-19 crisis.  The Council announced that it would honour all existing funding commitments and asked in particular that its regularly funded arts organisation prioritise commitments to artists. Since March 12th the Arts Council has fast-tracked the payment of up to 90% of funding to organisations and individuals.  The Arts Council also announced that there will be no financial penalties for arts organisations and individuals unable to deliver programmed events and activities arising from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>The Government has provided income supports for people who have lost employment as a result of the restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the corona virus.  My colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is responsible for the COVID 19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  This payment paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, is available to employees and self-employed.  To receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, a person must be aged between 18 and 66 years, resident in the State and have been in employment up to March 2020.  Self-employed people who have experienced a collapse of their income, and are available to take up other full-time work if it was available, also qualify.  Further detail on this emergency payment and the full range of income supports available to people is available on <i>www.gov.ie</i></p></reply>
