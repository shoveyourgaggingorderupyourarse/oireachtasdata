    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-22a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052200026#WRA02000"><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.</p><p>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network.<b></b></p><p>Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access and audio/visual aids, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage, including the 17 new rail stations built since 2007. </p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2018-2027, sets out the national vision and ambition for the delivery of key critical infrastructure over the next 10 years, including in relation to public transport infrastructure.  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are due to be delivered under the NDP over the period to 2027. As with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. </p><p>However, work remains to be done in terms of the retro-fitting of older infrastructure to make it accessible for people with a disability. In particular, gaps remain in relation to railway infrastructure and facilities as most of the rail network was originally developed during the Victorian era. </p><p>To address infrastructural legacy issues, my Department funds a programme of accessibility improvement grants, managed by the NTA,  to upgrade existing and older infrastructure and facilities, including the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users. In this regard, I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme to &euro;28 million for the period 2018 to 2021, as part of the 4-year capital envelope for public transport announced in Budget 2018.  In 2018, &euro;1m was provided for rail station accessibility upgrades and this has been increased to &euro;3m for 2019.  With this increase in funding it is envisaged that larger projects will be undertaken at railway stations including the installation of lifts and bridges to allow easy access &quot;across track&quot; platforms for wheelchair users.  There will also be a continued investment programme under the NDP to fund retro-fitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility.  </p><p>I provided additional funding to Irish Rail last year, for the development of a dedicated &quot;app&quot; to support customers who have mobility or sensory impairments. The app will allow users to pre-book a journey that confirms that they will have assistance by a member of Irish Rail staff at their departure and arrival stations and provide them with support in an emergency.</p><p>I am advised that Irish Rail is taking a number of other measures to improve access for people with disabilities to rail and DART services.  These include the company introducing a new improved Accessibility Policy.  This involves a new zonal system for the DART, Maynooth and Northern Commuter lines that is designed to provide better service and quicker response times to passengers who require assistance.  This policy divides the stations on these lines into zones, with each comprising one to four stations.  One station in each zone will always be manned and will provide support to other stations in that zone.  Full details are available on the Irish Rail website.  Following a successful pilot, Irish Rail has reduced the notice period for providing assistance to customers on the DART from 24 hours to 4 hours and has also rolled this out to the Maynooth and Northern Commuter lines.  The company hopes to reduce this notice period further.</p><p>Irish Rail is currently training Customer Service Officers (CSOs) for deployment on all inter-city routes, with all services planned to have a CSO in place by the end of 2019.  This will mean that all services with a CSO on board will be able to ensure ramp assistance is available.  It is intended that this will eliminate the requirement for advance notice on all inter-city routes. </p></reply>

As Ireland&rsquo;s NADO, Sport Ireland and its staff undertake a range of vitally important services in the fight against the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in sport.  I am happy to confirm to the Deputy that I have a very favourable view of the work done by Sport Ireland Anti-Doping  which provides assurance in the integrity of Irish sport at both national and international levels. I would like to highlight in that context that the anti-doping programme managed by Sport Ireland is highly respected internationally.</p><p>In relation to the outcomes for 2018, it is encouraging to note that there was just one anti-doping rule violation recorded. It is in my view particularly important to see rising numbers engaging with Sport Ireland&rsquo;s anti-doping education<b></b>programme, which clearly shows that the vast majority of the Irish Sporting Community has absolutely no tolerance for doping in sport and remains proactive and determined to defeat it. The Irish Government is equally determined in that objective.</p><p>Sport Ireland has been working very closely with their colleagues internationally to defend the interests of clean athletes and clean sport. The agency and its Chief Executive, John Treacy, have taken a leading role in seeking for a more robust global anti-doping regime, that is fit for purpose and applies the rules without fear or favour. Together with Mr Treacy, I attended the White House Round table Event on doping in sport last November, where we heard compelling testimony from athletes themselves, and their calls for Governments to support their NADOs and athletes in the fight against doping in sport. I would like to assure Sport Ireland of the continued support of both Minister Griffin and me  in that regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-22a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052200026#WRA02800"><p>Firstly, I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this issue here today.  I know that the Deputy is very much aware of the issues surrounding this matter but for the consideration of the House, I would like to firstly outline some background to this issue.</p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  It is under this Act that local authorities can choose to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward.  Some local authorities develop bye-laws to licence horse-drawn carriages operating commercially. Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations. </p>  <p>  In February 2011, Dublin City Council or DCC took over responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers from the Garda Carriage Office. DCC made bye-laws in the same year for the licensing of horse-drawn carriages. They made these bye-laws under the Local Government Act, 2001.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has had sight of a material suggesting that DCC has no legal basis to make such bye-laws and indicating that such powers may instead still rest under the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853, 1854 and 1855 with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom the Garda&iacute; are the successors.  </p>  <p>  Since this older Dublin-specific legislation was not repealed, powers for licensing horse-drawn carriages in Dublin still exist in statute.  This may mean that DCC may not be permitted to make bye-laws in this respect under the 2001 Act as bye-laws may not be made under that Act where powers exist elsewhere in legislation.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy previously raised this issue here in the House. As a first step however, my Department sought legal advice.  Advice was very recently provided and an engagement with DCC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on-going.  If it is the case that Victorian legislation needs to be repealed, this will be done and, as a result, DCC will be able to use the Local Government Act 2001 to licence these horse-drawn carriages. Given the requirement for a period to prioritise Brexit-related legislative work over all other requests for legislative drafting, the Taxi Regulation (Amendment) (Rickshaw) Bill 2018 was only very recently assigned to a Parliamentary Counsel so that work on developing the draft Bill can now commence in earnest. Subject to the outcome of the requested legal advice, it may be that that Bill will be the vehicle with which to repeal this Victorian legislation and, following publication, It is my clear intention to progress the Bill through the Houses without delay.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-22a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052200026#WRA03100"><p>Proposals to deliver an upgraded East-West route linking Dundalk to Sligo, taking in Cavan, involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible. Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. </p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal which are the subject of this PQ, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. </p>  <p>  This year I gave an allocation of &euro;100,000 to Cavan County Council to enable the Council to undertake a detailed appraisal, in line with the current requirements in the Public Spending Code and the Capital Investment Framework, of the Cavan to Dundalk section of the route.  The aim of this appraisal would be to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it can be justified in terms of appraisal and advanced for further consideration in relation to schemes for development post 2021.  Preparation of the appraisal is the responsibility of the Council.</p>  <p>  Regarding the reference by the Deputy to extending the M3 motorway to Cavan town, I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, construction and operation  of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  TII will of course work within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040. This encompasses the National Development Plan (NDP) which has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new National Planning Framework (NPF).  This provides the strategic and financial framework for TII&rsquo;s national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  In the ten years covered by the plan, over &euro;11 billion will be invested in the overall road network.  </p>  <p>  I can advise that the continuation of the M3 motorway to Cavan Town it is not referred to in the pipeline of projects outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP). </p>  <p>  However, the N3 Virginia Bypass Scheme is included among the pre-appraisal/early planning pipeline of projects in the NDP This scheme has been identified as a Strategic Investment Priority in the National Planning Framework (NPF) and NDP. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme will seek to remove the current inefficiencies of the existing road in terms of safety, capacity, and travel times. It is envisaged that it would also have a number of important benefits including:</p>  <p>  - Support economic growth by increasing network capacity and reducing  travel times between Dublin and the Northwest;</p>  <p>  - Improved Road Safety by reducing frequency and severity of collisions thereby contributing to the Road Safety Authority target of no more than 25 fatalities per million population by 2020; </p>  <p>  - Environmental improvements in noise, air and water quality for Virginia Town and  Lough Ramor (proposed Natural Heritage Area);  </p>  <p>  - Improved access to the National Road network for the towns of Ballyjamesduff and Bailieborough.</p>  <p>The project pre-appraisal plan for the Virginia Bypass has been approved by the economic evaluation unit within my Department and TII has provided an allocation of &euro;600k to Cavan County Council this year to progress planning and design work on the project.  Cavan County Council has advertised the tender competition for Technical Consultancy Services to progress the scheme through phases 1-4 of the Project Management Guidelines and expect to receive the tenders on 21st   May 2019.  </p>  <p>  This was scheduled to occur yesterday and my Department will receive an up-date on the outcome of that process in due course.</p></reply>

There is also an offshoot to  the Core Port  of Shannon Foynes. The Dublin - Rosslare Europort rail line links to Rosslare Harbour, a Harbour which is on the TEN-T Comprehensive Network but which doesn&rsquo;t meet the threshold for TEN-T Core port status. I have not applied to the European Commission to designate the Dublin to Rosslare railway line as part of the Core Network.</p>  <p>  EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc, wrote to Transport Ministers in February 2019 announcing that the Commission is considering advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. My Department is giving due consideration to this announcement and will very shortly make a formal submission to the Commission requesting an early review of the TEN-T Network, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  This submission will note that national developments since the TEN-T network was established should be taken into account during the review, including the National Development Plan, the National Planning Framework, and the implications of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy will be aware that Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T Network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process.</p>  <p>  The current CEF programme finishes at end 2020. A proposal for a new Regulation of the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018. Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.</p>  <p>  Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, includingthe rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant Calls for Proposals.</p></reply>

Of course there&rsquo;s an added complication with that option given the different rail gauge we use in Ireland.  I expect a decision on which of the two medium term options will be pursued will be made  very shortly.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, work on developing tender documentation and train specifications for the proposed bi-mode fleet of rail vehicles is progressing.  It is expected that the formal fleet acquisition tender process will be initiated in the next few weeks and that the fleet manufacturing contract will be awarded in Quarter 2 of next year.</p>  <p>  The enhancements to the heavy rail system provided for in the NTA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) 2016-2035&rsquo; will create an integrated rail network which will provide the core high-capacity transit system for the region and will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Maynooth, Hazelhatch/Celbridge as well as Drogheda and Greystones.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the fact that at certain times of the day, some rail services are currently crowded due to the level of demand. Deputies can be assured that the safe operation of the rail network and services is the overriding priority at all times of both the company and of course the Commission for Railway Regulation which is the independent, statutory body charged with overseeing the safety of our rail network. </p></reply>

The Policy recognises and supports actions relating to emissions and noise to mitigate the negative external impacts of aviation while facilitating the sustainable growth of the sector in support of business, tourism and air travel consumers.</p>  <p>  In line with Resolutions of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on climate change, Ireland continues to coordinate an Action Plan for Aviation Emissions Reduction. An updated Action Plan has been completed and submitted to ICAO on May 10 and is now published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The measures outlined in the Action Plan 2019-2023 at national level include ongoing programmes of fleet renewal by Irish registered airlines, moving to better fuel efficient engines and a range of air traffic management and airport operational improvements.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan is the result of consultation across the range of aviation stakeholders and details actions by them, both at supra-national and national level, designed to mitigate the impact of aviation on climate.</p>  <p>  Carbon (CO2) emissions from aviation have been included in the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) since 2012. Directive 2003/87/EC as amended, requires all airlines operating in Europe, to record emissions (calculated on the basis of measuring fuel consumed), report and verify their emissions, and to surrender allowances against those emissions. The number of allowances is capped requiring airlines to either reduce emissions or purchase emissions credits. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is designated the competent authority for administering the EU ETS scheme in respect of aircraft operators in Ireland.</p>  <p>  At its 39th Assembly in 2016 ICAO agreed to implement a Global Market Based Measure in the form of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to address any annual increase in total CO2 emissions from international civil aviation above the 2020 levels. It is the first such scheme agreed at international level for any industrial sector.</p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to allow aircraft operators offset emissions through the purchase of credits from verified environmental projects in areas outside of aviation. The scheme will be implemented in pilot, voluntary and mandatory phases to 2035 &ndash; Ireland is taking part in the voluntary pilot phase from 2021 alongside the other 43 members of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). The EU Commission is in the process of adopting various provisions for the appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions for the purpose of implementing CORSIA.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the EPA on the implementation of CORSIA at national level. The EPA is actively engaging with airlines on the reporting requirements for both EU-ETS and CORSIA.</p></reply>

It also provides a clear statement of transport planning policy for the GDA, around which other agencies involved in land use planning, environmental protection, and delivery of other infrastructure such as housing, water and power, can align their own investment priorities.  It is an essential component, along with investment programmes in other sectors, for the orderly development of the GDA over the next 20 years.</p>  <p>  In developing that strategy the Act requires the NTA to have regard to relevant national level transport policies as would be developed by my Department and approved by Government where relevant. </p>  <p>  Of those national level transport policies for example, the Deputy is aware of Smarter Travel &ndash; A Sustainable Transport Future, which committed to a major overhaul of bus services, such as that proposed by BusConnects.</p>  <p>  The Act requires the NTA to consult with a wide range of stakeholders during the development of the strategy, including the Joint Oireachtas Committee.</p>  <p>  The Act also requires that the NTA submit a draft of its transport strategy to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for his or her approval. </p>  <p>  The Strategy put forward a strategic level approach toward delivering an efficient, reliable and effective bus system for the GDA and set out high-level principles with regard to development of a core bus network of 16 radial corridors and the development of a number of orbital corridors also.</p>  <p>  In February 2016 the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport approved the draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 to 2035 and since that time the NTA has sought to begin delivery of the Strategy and its ambitious programme of investment.</p>  <p>  It is the statutory responsibility of the NTA to provide public transport infrastructure and services in Dublin and their development of the BusConnects at a project level reflects that responsibility and fits within the statutory framework described above. </p>  <p>  My Department regularly meets with the NTA to discuss relevant issues, including in relation to the delivery of BusConnects. </p>  <p>  As Minister I am of course kept informed by my Department as required and have also met with the NTA to be specifically briefed on certain issues as I deem appropriate. The most recent meeting I held with the NTA in relation to BusConnects was prior to the launch of the public consultations on the development of the new bus corridors. </p></reply>

While this project is on-going I am keen to help mitigate any adverse impacts on the tourism industry, including cruise tourism.  With these concerns in mind, I met with Dublin Port in March. The Company outlined to me its capital development plans and rationale for prioritisation in the context of Brexit, as well as the specifics with regard to cruise berths.  </p>  <p>  At this meeting it was explained that as part of the ABR Project, Alexandra Quay West will be under construction for at least two years from 2021 to 2023. Given the space constraints, cruise berths will be limited for a three year period from 2021 to allow the necessary construction work to take place. During this period freight ships that normally berth there will have to relocate to Ocean Pier West, the berth on which large cruise ships are currently handled.  </p>  <p>  Dublin Port Company have assured me that it will operate a full cruise volume in 2019 and 2020 but while cruise calls will be facilitated from 2021 to 2023, they will be limited to circa 80 ships per annum. When the work is completed at Alexandra Quay West cruise volumes are expected to revert towards 150 for years 2024/2025.</p>  <p>  The Company has already secured planning permission to construct new berths for cruise ships on the North Wall Quay Extension. The cost benefit analysis currently underway in respect of these additional berths (due for publication later this year) will form a solid basis for discussion on how this vision can be brought to fruition.</p>  <p>  Through my wider stakeholder engagements, I have encouraged port and cruise industry stakeholders to take maximum advantage of other options available during the period of construction at Dublin port, when a reduced number of berths will be available for cruise calls.  While Dublin Port is important in attracting cruise liners to Ireland through Dublin, other benefits can accrue to other ports around our coast.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, Cobh continues as a dedicated cruise berth and will remain so post-Brexit.  I also welcome the fact that the Port of Cork is working with Belfast Harbour to see if they can take some of the additional business that may be lost as a result of Dublin Port's infrastructural works. In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the development and promotion of the cruise tourism sector.</p></reply>

The Deputy rightly notes that compressed natural gas is a fossil fuel; accordingly, natural gas is only being considered as a pathway towards incorporating renewable biogas, or biomethane, into the transport fuel mix.</p>  <p>  Biomethane use can significantly reduce pollutant emissions compared to diesel powered engines and can dramatically reduce carbon emissions by capturing energy from Ireland&rsquo;s food and biological wastes and residues. The anaerobic digestion industry, which produces biomethane, is also a developing indigenous industry which could support a synergistic circular economy between the transport and agricultural sectors, while improving national fuel security and contributing towards 2030 sectoral targets under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Clean Vehicles Directive, which legislates for public procurement at European level and will include within its scope the purchase of public urban buses, has undergone recent revision and is shortly expected to enter into force.  Noting the role of the Directive in relation to bus fleet transition, the Deputy may be interested to learn that post-2025 over half of Ireland&rsquo;s urban bus procurements will be required to deploy zero-emission fuels or technologies.  Noting this requirement, the pending findings from the Low Emission Bus Trials, and additional research and market information, considerable deliberation is required to determine the future direction of bus procurement in the short and medium term. It would be premature to rule in favour or against any particular alternative fuel or technology in advance of these deliberations.</p></reply>

In the short term the immediate impact has been the drop in value of sterling and from a tourism perspective Ireland has become a more expensive destination for UK visitors as a result. </p>  <p>  Since the referendum the Government has had a clear focus on our overall priorities and these are mirrored in the tourism sector. These priorities have included protecting the peace process, no hard border, maintenance of the Common Travel Area, maintenance of existing aviation traffic rights and an effective transitional agreement leading to the closest possible trading relationship with the UK.</p>  <p>  The Government has allocated almost &euro;8 million in additional funding to the tourism agencies this year specifically to respond to the impact of Brexit. Tourism Ireland have put in place a programme of marketing activity, post-Brexit research, and stakeholder information to ensure that potential visitors in relevant markets fully appreciate that it is "business as usual" for Ireland and the Irish tourism industry. Tourism Ireland have also put in place a Tourism Taskforce on Brexit which has met regularly to maintain liaison with the British, European and UK Inbound trade and with the UK Tourism Alliance. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland are investing &euro;5 million this year to support the tourism enterprises to respond to the impact of Brexit.  The &lsquo;Get Brexit Ready&rsquo; programme is helping businesses to assess the risk and respond to changes and will also assist the sector in diversifying into other markets. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work is focusing primarily on border counties and the South East region which have been most adversely affected by the drop in the value of sterling. </p>  <p>  As part of its Brexit preparations, Tourism Ireland commissioned a wide-ranging review of the British market, independently chaired and led by a steering group of key representatives of the Irish and UK-based tourism industry. Minister Griffin will launch the new strategy in the coming weeks and this will provide a blueprint for future activity in this important market.</p></reply>

Notably, we have firmly established a target of 500,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 as well as committing to no longer buying diesel-only urban buses from July this year. </p>  <p>  A new All of Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption which will bring a required step-change in our national climate ambition over the next decade and beyond is in preparation.  My Department has worked closely with that of Minister Bruton in the development of the Plan to guarantee that the transport elements contribute meaningfully to the national emission reduction efforts.  We intend that the Plan will have a strong focus on action, deliverables and defined timeframes setting out the time-bound targets and goals the Deputy is seeking. </p>  <p>  Of course this Plan will build on the important and successful work currently underway to decarbonise transport.  The Low Emitting Vehicle Taskforce has made a series of recommendations that have been adopted by Government establishing a suite of continued and new supports for electric vehicles and I am delighted that Ireland now has over 10,000 electric cars on the road. Together with the significant investment in public and active travel I have secured, I expect to see transport emissions contract again as these key technological and behavioural changes occur in the years to come.  I was pleased to see that the most recent EPA emissions inventory recorded a fall in transport emissions in 2017.</p></reply>

Similarly, the potential outstanding drawdown amounts for the organisation under the Sports Capital Programme are modest in scale and not significant enough to impact on the organisation's overall financial situation. It is important to recognise that State funding to this organisation is a small proportion of its total income and that the organisation has significant commercial revenues. </p>  <p>  I am glad that the organisation and its Board are now engaging constructively with Sport Ireland to address the serious issues which have occurred. I would encourage them to continue their efforts to rebuild trust, so that funding can be restored. The Board of Sport Ireland will keep this matter under constant review and provide regular updates to Minister Griffin and me on progress. When all necessary steps have been taken, we will consider reinstatement of funding.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-05-22a.107.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019052200027#WRB05300"><p>It is estimated that public transport (bus, rail, taxi) accounts for a little over 1% of Ireland's overall non-ETS carbon emissions, and less that one-twentieth of the emissions from the transport sector.  Accordingly, converting our public transport fleets to lower-carbon alternatives will have a limited, though positive, impact on reducing national CO2 emissions.  That said, I am convinced that moving to low-emission alternatives for public transport is important so as to promote and normalise the use of non-conventional lower emitting fuels and technologies to the general public. So, in order to show leadership in this area, we have a comprehensive programme of work underway to reduce the sector's carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  Also, improving public and active transport services and infrastructure is a key priority if Ireland is to cater in an environmentally sustainable way, for increasing travel demand and to provide a meaningful alternative to the private car.  Under Project Ireland 2040, &euro;8.6 billion in investment has been committed to public and active transport.  Major sustainable transport projects planned include the BusConnects Programme, investment in the DART Expansion Programme, and the MetroLink, as well as a multi-annual urban cycling and walking infrastructure investment of over &euro;110 million in our main cities.</p>  <p>  It is clear that prioritising investment in our public transport network is working - during the reporting period of 2017 alone, an additional 16 million public transport passenger journeys were made in Ireland while the number of walking and cycling trips also increased dramatically, particularly within the Greater Dublin Area.  To ensure that the carbon footprint of this significant modal shift is minimised it is critical that our public transport fleets continue to improve in energy and emission efficiencies.</p>  <p>  In the urban bus fleet, a clear trajectory to low emission buses has been outlined.  We are committed in Project Ireland 2040 to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from this July.  In preparation for both this immediate transition and the development of a longer-term low-carbon bus procurement strategy, my Department, together with the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, has undertaken a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials which are expected to conclude in the coming weeks.  Under the BusConnects Programme it is expected that approximately half of the public urban bus fleet will have moved to lower emitting alternatives by 2023 with full conversion by 2030. </p>  <p>  It is equally important to consider the potential contribution of electrified rail to the decarbonisation objective.  An estimated &euro;2 billion is earmarked for investment in the DART Expansion Programme which will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin and high-frequency electrified services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks.  We also expect to accept delivery of our first new diesel-electric trains in 2022, which will enable the enlargement of the rail fleet by approximately some 300 new rail carriages.  These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact our sectoral emissions profile.</p>  <p>  In relation to the taxi, hackney and limousine sector, it is clear that electrification presents an achievable pathway towards decarbonisation.  To this end, I established the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Grant Scheme in 2018, providing purchase reliefs of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, in addition to the range of other incentives supporting electric vehicles.  I have allocated &euro;500,000 from my Department's Green Public Transport Fund in support of this initiative further into 2019.</p>  <p>  I have, of course, met with Minister Bruton to discuss decarbonising the transport sector as we work to prepare the forthcoming new All-of-Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption.</p></reply>

As I believe the Deputy will appreciate, any attempt to stop these vehicles in an area where members of the public are present could put innocent bystanders, as well as the riders of the vehicles, at risk.  As the Deputy may also be aware, during the course of that debate I indicated that I would be willing to engage with Deputies Curran and Lahart and other Deputies who may have a particular interest in this issue to see if we can identify improvements that can be made to legislation.</p></reply>

Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and, accordingly, credits, bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabiting couples are expressly recognised for the purpose of social welfare law but are not recognised for the purposes of Income Tax law. Although this may appear contradictory, a key aim of both the welfare code and the tax code is to uphold the constitutional right of married couples not to be treated less favourably than unmarried couples.</p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for the Minister for Employment Affairs &amp;amp; Social Protection. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

No. 485 of 2015), the Irish transposing Regulations, there are 18 classes of non-life insurance.  Employer liability and public liability insurance fall within the category of general liability insurance, under this regulatory framework.</p>  <p>  In terms of day to day supervision of the insurance industry this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland.  I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland also has a number of powers which allow it to issue codes of conduct or requirements to the regulated financial services sector.  With respect to codes of conduct specifically for employers liability or public liability insurance, I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it does not have any such codes.  Having said that, it is important to note that The Central Bank has its Consumer Protection Code. That Code, which is a set of rules and principles that all regulated financial services firms must follow when providing financial products and services to consumers, also applies in respect of employers liability and public liability insurance.  The definition of consumer in the Code covers natural persons, groups of persons, partnerships, small businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;3 million annually and members of a credit union.  The Code therefore covers a large number of businesses operating in the Irish market and offers a significant level of protection for such businesses in relation to their engagement with insurers.  </p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  The patronage process for the school referred to by the Deputy is complete and patronage has been awarded to Educate Together.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s priority is ensuring all pupils have access to a school place which may not always result in a school place that is their first choice. A range of factors including parental choice, school location and commuting patterns can contribute to oversubscription of certain schools within an area.</p>  <p>  My Department appointed a Project Manager in July 2018 to assist with the work of prioritising the procurement of interim accommodation for 17 new schools due to be established in September 2019 which includes the school to serve the area to which the Deputy refers.  </p>  <p>  Numerous locations within the school planning area were considered in relation to the interim accommodation for the school but could not be secured due to lack of suitability, availability or prohibitive zoning issues.</p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to ensure that the school could open in September 2019 as announced it was necessary to look for interim accommodation in adjoining school planning areas.  On 15 March 2019 a planning application was submitted to Fingal County Council for a location at Suttonians Rugby Club, John McDowell Memorial Grounds, Station Road, Sutton, Dublin 13, D13 AH97.  The notification of decision to grant planning permission was issued by the local authority on 2nd   May, 2019, Final Grant is awaited.</p>  <p>  The new primary school will open in September 2019 in suitable interim accommodation pending delivery of its permanent building. </p></reply>

In May 2018, following a comprehensive review of the data/evidence available and consideration, by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the lead policy Department for the sector, of a detailed business case a pilot quota based scheme was introduced for the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative, and of dairy farm assistant which were removed from the employment permit ineligible occupation list. The quotas introduced were 500, 1500 and 50 respectively.  The scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities. To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful with the number of permits issued being 101 out of 500 horticulture worker permits. 1377 out of 1,500 meat processing operatives and 49 out of 50 for dairy farm assistants. </p>  <p>  These lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review process involving consideration of  research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by my Department which includes the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p>  <p>  The pilot scheme provides that additional employment permit quotas may be granted in response to progress reported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on commitments given by the sector to:</p>  <p>  - the systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding sourcing labour from the live register and across the EEA;</p>  <p>  - the development of training, upskilling and career opportunities;</p>  <p>  - a commitment to examine the potential of innovation in the sector to ameliorate reliance on a model of low skill, low wage employment.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the sector is currently preparing a further business case for consideration initially by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for submission to my Department.  The next review  to consider changes to the lists of occupations is scheduled to commence before the of May.</p></reply>

We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.</p>  <p>  Significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services over the past number of years. Since this Government took up office, the budget for Disability Services has increased by &euro;314million. This year alone, the Health Service Executive has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to its Disability Services Programme.</p>  <p>  My primary concern is to ensure the continuity of appropriate person-centred disability services is maintained and delivered in an equitable manner consistent with the care and support needs of individuals. I want to acknowledge the important services provided by Rehab and the commitment of the staff of Rehab to people with a disability and their families.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that the total revenue allocation provided by the HSE to Rehab for social services has increased by &euro;8.1 million to &euro;56.1million in 2019 when compared with the allocation in 2016.</p>  <p>  Rehab provides a range of services to young people and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, mental health difficulties, autism, or acquired brain injury. Services are co-ordinated through Rehab&rsquo;s three service delivery divisions, RehabCare, the National Learning Network and Rehab Enterprises.</p>  <p>  Rehab and the HSE have committed to working intensively together with a view to making substantive progress in reaching a solution to the issues. </p>  <p>  As the question relates to service provision I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

As a result, private outpatient clinics may be held on  the public hospital campus but these clinics must be held outside  contracted hours.  </p><p>The new children's hospital is obliged to provide  such facilities for consultants holding such contracts. The proposal is for consultants to pay a fee for use of the rooms and other operational costs.  </p><p>Within the plan for the hospital, an area has been planned which carries the designation of &quot;private clinic&quot;. Within the &lsquo;private clinic&rsquo; area the following has been drawn:</p><p>- 1 x reception desk area x 7m2</p><p>- 1 x feeding room x 4m2</p><p>- 1 x wait area x 16m2</p><p>- 1 x play area x 8m</p><p>- 8 x consult/examination rooms x 16m2 </p><p>- 1 x WC x 3m2</p><p>- 1 x clean utility x 9m2</p><p>- 1 x dirty utility x 7m2</p><p>- Total area: 180m2 </p><p>This work is planned to proceed at the building commissioning stage in the year before the building opens.</p></reply>

Ratifying the Convention offers us an opportunity to reassess our attitudes to people with disabilities and to place a renewed focus on their place in society, to rebalance the right of people with disabilities to make decisions for themselves, rather than have decisions made for them. The Optional Protocol will be ratified following the completion of the first reporting cycle under the Convention, which I am informed by my officials in the Department of Justice and Equality  will be in the next two years or so.  </p>  <p>  In the context of health services, this year we will spend some &euro;1.9bn on services for people with a disability. We will continue to improve services and increase supports for people with disabilities, with a particular focus on supports at key transition points such as going to school, progressing to further training or education, or moving into a new home.  </p>  <p>  In 2019 our disability health services will provide residential services to around 8,500 people with disabilities at approximately 1,100 locations. We now have less than 2,200 people with a disability living in congregated settings. A further 160 people are expected to move to community living in 2019, as we prioritise the moving of people from old style institutions into modern community living homes. An extra &euro;10m provided last year has delivered 12 new dedicated respite houses, and the provision of alternative respite services to over 2,000 children and adults. </p>  <p>  This year, the HSE expects to provide over 182,000 respite nights and 32,662 respite day sessions. 1.63m PA hours for 2,535 people and just under 3.08m home support hours for 8,094 people. </p>  <p>  The HSE also expects to provide 90 new residential emergency places and day service supports for at least 1,500 young people leaving school/rehab training. 100 additional therapy posts were secured as part of Budget 2019, and these will be used to address delays in conducting Assessments of Need.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Health is continuing to progress Heads of Bill to provide legislative clarity and procedural safeguards in regard to deprivation of liberty.  In developing its approach, the Department is aiming to strike the right balance between providing the appropriate levels of protection for individuals on the one hand and ensuring that the approach is practical and workable on the other.   </p>  <p>  The Department continues to address a number of complex legal and policy issues which have arisen during the drafting process and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

This staff complement has significant experience in developing and implementing climate and energy policy at international, EU, national, regional and local levels. In addition to its own staff, the Department also has access to scientific and technical advice in agencies under its aegis to assist it in delivering the Government&rsquo;s climate policy objectives.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation and annual publication of official inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions, and for reporting this data to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Oireachtas receives a summary of the most recent inventory and projections prepared by the EPA each year in the Annual Transition Statement, which I am required to prepare and submit in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p>  <p>  The EPA also provides a range of expert scientific and technical advice on climate change to the Government. The EPA supports the Department in representing Ireland at relevant meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EPA also undertakes a number of climate-related research and awareness activities, including the provision of support for the delivery of activities under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. The EPA also produces, in accordance with its statutory mandate, a quadrennial State of the Environment Report which provides an integrated assessment of the overall quality of Ireland's environment, the pressures being placed on it and the societal responses to current and emerging environmental issues. The last such report was published in 2016, includes a specific focus on climate change, and is available from the EPA&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Department is also supported in the delivery of its policy objectives for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed, inter alia, by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers.  SEAI had a total of 91 staff as at the end of December 2018. The EPA had a total of 410 staff at that time. While it is difficult to fully disaggregate the number of EPA staff working on climate issues, the EPA estimate this at 32.</p>  <p>  The work of both EPA and SEAI inform, in turn, the wider work of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group, which provides the overall framework for the provision of technical capacity to Government Departments for climate action policy development and implementation. </p>  <p>  TRAM was established on foot of a Government Decision in 2015 and its membership comprises technical experts from relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, representatives of externally contracted bodies providing modelling and analytical support may participate in TRAM meetings. To date, these services have been provided by the ESRI, UCC, UCD and EnvEcon. </p></reply>

In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high speed broadband.  The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this.

The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  The design of the NBP State intervention network calls for both overhead and underground sections of cable and the final 'drop' cable used to make the final connection to premises (either overhead or underground ). The number of fibre strands in a particular section will depend on the route design. Each route is specifically designed following a detailed site survey and the route cables are dimensioned to cater for existing and planned (at the time of deployment) premises. The cable dimensioning will include an additional fibre allowance to cater for future capacity requirements. </p>  <p>  The cost of roll out per linear metre is information which is commercially sensitive within the telecommunications sector, as this fibre is sourced on the open commercial market. To disclose such information could allow suppliers to gain an unfair advantage and be disadvantageous to the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State intervention as a whole.</p></reply>

Fibre was proposed by the bidders in the process as the best solution, which involves deployment of fibre cable along poles and ducts within the intervention area.  Also under State Aid guidelines as much as possible of the network build will comprise the re-use of existing infrastructure. To align with this requirement, the company to be set up to deploy and manage the network, National Broadband Ireland, will rent this infrastructure from existing infrastructure owners. Infrastructure re-use in this manner ensures the State complies with State Aid guidelines, environmental sustainability best practice, and minimises costs. Having considered the options available regarding the re-use of infrastructure the bidder proposed to predominantly re-use eir's existing regulated infrastructure.</p>  <p>  However, the ESB network may still used by National Broadband Ireland where it is more effective than using the eir pole and duct network, including in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy in his question.</p></reply>

This preparation is continuing through extensive contingency planning and stakeholder engagement. While planning continues for both a no-deal Brexit and the &lsquo;central case&rsquo; scenario, the Government&rsquo;s preparations for a no-deal Brexit increased significantly in recent months in the lead up to the end of March as we faced a possible no-deal Brexit. </p><p>While the full implications of Brexit for our air and maritime transport are not yet clear, I do not anticipate that direct maritime or direct air services by community air carriers between Ireland and continental Europe will be affected, even in a no-deal Brexit scenario.</p><p>That said, a significant proportion of our goods destined for EU markets are transported via the UK landbridge to access these markets. Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe. </p><p>In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. Following a series of meetings between my officials and the major ferry companies operating at Irish ports, I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports. These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, which is operating<b></b>between Dublin and Cherbourg since March 2019. Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.</p><p>Officials from my Department have also been heavily engaged with the work at EU-level to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the aviation sector. The recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2019/502 on common rules ensuring basic air connectivity aims to ensure the continuation of a basic level of air connectivity for citizens and business between the UK and Europe in the event of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement. While certain provisions within this Regulation have entered into force, the majority will only apply if and when the UK exits the EU without a deal. </p><p>In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity. Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme. There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports.</p></reply>

It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  The Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  To make the transition to the new Scheme as smooth as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme once it launches (targeted for October/ November 2019) or can remain on their current childcare subsidy programme for one final year.</p>  <p>  With regard to income-based subsidies awarded under the Scheme, parents who are working, studying or who meet certain other conditions will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy (up to a maximum of 40 hours per week).  The definitions of &lsquo;work&rsquo; and &lsquo;study&rsquo; will be set out in regulations made under the Childcare Support Act 2018 and will be comprehensive, covering differing types of work and study arrangements, such as part-time, week on/ week off and zero hour contract arrangements.  </p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. By removing many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing programmes, a far greater number of families will be eligible for targeted, income-related subsidies. Many families will, for the first time, be entitled to subsidies which will reduce their childcare costs significantly. </p>  <p>  There may, however, be a small number of cases where a family who is currently receiving the maximum rate for full-time childcare under an existing programme, may receive less under the National Childcare Scheme, particularly if their child is &ndash;  in reality &ndash; receiving afterschool care rather than full-time childcare.  In such cases, the family can remain on their current payment in the transition period following the Scheme&rsquo;s launch.  I have also directed my officials to undertake research and analysis to examine any adjustments to the National Childcare Scheme which might be required to address unusual or anomalous cases, where this is the right thing to do to protect and benefit lower income parents.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, I would highlight that the new National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, any adjustments deemed necessary by Government can be carried out in a quick and responsive manner.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that my Department also funds Educational Welfare services which are operated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. The Schools Completion Programme regularly provides after-school services or homework clubs. These are most often provided in areas of disadvantage. The funding for Educational Welfare activities is unaffected by the National Childcare Scheme.</p></reply>

I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, on a phased basis, the first revaluation of that scale, encompassing all rating authority areas, in over 160 years. </p>  <p>  Under the current phase of the revaluation programme, Proposed Valuation Certificates were issued in March 2019 to ratepayers in the Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow rating authority areas.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation and the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority as part of their reserved functions. </p>  <p>  The proposed valuation entered on the Proposed Valuation Certificates is not a bill for rates. It is a statement of the valuation that the Commissioner proposes to set with effect from 1 January 2020.  In order to arrive at an estimated rates liability for 2020 and subsequent years, the proposed valuation provided by the Valuation Office would need to be multiplied by the indicative ARV published by the relevant local authority. </p>  <p>  The Fingal County Council rating authority area is undergoing a second revaluation in 2019, having initially been the subject of a revaluation in 2009. The new valuations for Fingal County Council will be published on 17 September 2019, and become effective for rates purposes from 2020 onwards.</p>  <p>  Given that the process of a revaluation involves both an adjustment to valuations and an adjustment to the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), local authorities notify ratepayers of an indicative ARV, when proposed valuations are issued to ratepayers, in order to help contextualise their proposed valuation and estimate their potential rates bill. The actual ARV is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the revaluation promotes equity across sectors and areas, but is also a revenue neutral exercise in overall terms, the Minister may limit the total amount of rates collectable within the local authority area in the year following a revaluation to that collected in the previous year, subject to minor adjustments.</p></reply>

The draft Commission Regulation, if accepted by Member States, would appear reasonable in the circumstances as it is in line with the AEWA commitment.  It is also my understanding that the draft Regulation will provide for a generous lead-in time to allow hunters to make the necessary arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot.  </p>  <p>  My Department had already had initial discussions with a major hunting body on the draft Regulation and will be engaging with other interested parties on the matter.</p></reply>
