    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500049#WRA02000"><p>At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the very significant impact of the recent measures on individuals, communities and businesses in Kildare Laois and Offaly. I am fully aware that the improved situation in these counties has been due to the willingness of everyone to adhere to the public health guidance and the measures that were implemented. I would like to publicly thank all the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly for their efforts over the past number of weeks in reducing the spread of Covid-19 across their counties. I would also like to acknowledge the work of my colleague Deputy Lawless during this time. </p>  <p>  We now know, through the work of those in the affected counties, and what happened to the virus, that localised measures do work. As part of our deliberations on the development of the Roadmap for Resilience and Recovery which will be published later today, the learnings from the introduction of the measures in Kildare, Laois and Offaly were considered. </p>  <p>  The decision to apply additional, enhanced public health measures to Kildare was based upon the available epidemiological evidence that was emerging at that stage. </p>  <p>  As with many outbreak control measures, the full effect of the public health measures applied can take up to two incubation periods (28 days) of the virus to see full effect. It is worth recalling that we are still within this timeframe. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy that the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and the Department have examined the currently available epidemiological information in order to learn about the effects of the measures within Kildare and the surrounding areas. </p>  <p>  In August, the cases per 100,000 population in Kildare, Laois and Offaly increased quickly and sharply. In Kildare, the increase in this incidence rate was initially driven by workplace outbreak related cases. Seven days later, a second peak emerged, driven primarily by household outbreak cases in the first instance as well as further workplace outbreak cases and isolated cases. The volumes of cases seen in Kildare during these peaks were as high as those observed at the height of the national epidemic in April of this year.  </p>  <p>  Since this time, the incidence rates in Kildare have dropped considerably, although it does remain one of the highest in the country currently. The average number of cases identified each day has also decreased significantly. </p>  <p>  As with the rest of the country, the epidemiological situation will continue to be monitored closely by the Department, the HSE, the HPSC and the NPHET. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500049#WRA02300"><p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the work done by Deputy Griffin in advocating for the people of Kerry.  University Hospital Kerry is an integral part of the South/South West Hospital Group and provides comprehensive medical and surgical services not only in Co. Kerry but also in West Limerick and North Cork.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the Group has been working closely with UHK management and staff to enhance staffing, services and facilities, particularly over the last two years.  The UHK budget has increased by 32% to &euro;98m since 2015, while staff numbers have risen by 38% during the same period.</p>  <p>  Additional resources have been provided to support maternity services, additional Emergency Department nursing posts, and the opening of a new 4-Bedded Acute Stroke Unit to manage approximately 200 strokes per year. The refurbishment of the intensive care unit has facilitated greater efficiency within the hospital&rsquo;s critical care service and has enhanced compliance with infection control standards.  Since the outbreak of COVID- 19 the hospital has received funding to construct COVID pathways in the Emergency Department and 15 additional surge beds have been opened in the last 2 weeks.</p>  <p>  Deputy Griffin has also demonstrated his commitment in this House to ensuring that the communities in Kerry are provided with the best primary care services possible be that in terms of seeking improvement to physical  infrastructure or additional staffing.  I look forward to working with him to address his concerns and would  hope, for example, that Kerry may benefit from some of the &euro;10 million in funding that  I  have recently approved for enhanced community services. </p>  <p>  These developments outline the commitment to achieve equity across the South/South West Hospital Group and to ensure that UHK can meet the needs of the community it serves.  Our health services are facing unprecedented challenges in the months ahead. However, these developments will help to ensure that the necessary resources are in place to deliver safe patient care in University Hospital Kerry.</p></reply>

    <ques id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.27.q" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500049#WRA02600"><p><i>41.</i> To ask the Minister for Health the system for providing medical cards to persons on palliative care; if a means test applies; the length of time the application process takes; and if he will make a statement on the matter. <b>[23277/20]</b></p></ques>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500049#WRA02700"><p>Under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means and does not provide for automatic eligibility based on having a particular disease or illness.  </p><p>That said, it is vitally important we do as much as possible to support people in palliative care, including where appropriate through the provision of a medical card. I wish therefore at the outset to thank the Deputy for raising such an important issue.</p><p>The HSE has a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months.</p><p>Importantly, these applications do not require a financial means assessment nor are they ever reassessed.  This approach is appropriate and undoubtedly is a great source of assurance to persons who are receiving palliative care and in need of support.  </p><p>I am informed that generally, such medical cards are active on the system within 24 hours of the HSE National Medical Card Unit reviewing a medical report and completed application form from a healthcare professional.</p><p>Individuals may also qualify for a medical card through the means assessment process. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where individuals exceed the income guidelines.</p><p>Separately, I also note that since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500049#WRA03100"><p>I acknowledge that the current restrictions in maternity hospitals are presenting difficulties and this is hugely regrettable.  However, it is necessary to reduce footfall in order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole.  </p>  <p>  Maternity hospitals have performed well during the pandemic and have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe.  The fact that there have been no Covid maternal deaths in this country,and that we have a had a low incidence in pregnant women, suggests that the current approach is working.</p>  <p>  However, we must remain vigilant as services resume and higher numbers of people attend hospitals. Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.  In that context, I can assure the Deputy that restrictions, currently in place in Cavan and Drogheda, have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p></reply>

The MOU was entered into in order to strengthen North/South co-operation on the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The MOU has formalised and underpinned the significant engagement between the Ministers, the Chief Medical Officers, and the Departments throughout this pandemic. The MOU is facilitating greater co-operation and consistency of approach wherever possible on areas such as public health messaging, programmes of behavioural change, evidence base/modelling and contact-tracing.  </p>  <p>  My predecessor, Deputy Harris, and I have been in ongoing contact with the Minister of Health in Northern Ireland throughout this pandemic in relation to how each health system is implementing various public health responses.

This committee will be mandated to drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on the commitments made in this policy, which will have a 10-year duration. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health, in consultation with the HSE, is currently developing the terms of reference and membership requirements for this committee.  It is expected that the committee will work with partners to evaluate performance against key performance indicators, and will check overall progress so that the system will be in a position to respond effectively to support population mental health needs.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that sub-committees will be established to progress specific actions contained in the policy.  The NIMC committee will report to the Minister of State for Mental Health &amp;amp; Older People, and to the relevant Cabinet Committee. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the NIMC committee and sub-committees will be representative of those stakeholders involved in ensuring effective delivery of the policy recommendations, including strong service user, service provider and voluntary sector representation. </p>  <p>  All input received during the consultation on the policy, and any other stakeholder views, will be considered in establishing the committee. The committee&rsquo;s proposed membership composition and terms of reference, when finalised, will be submitted to the Cabinet. I anticipate that that the committee will be established by October 2020.</p></reply>

The GAA is at the very heart of our community and the decision taken by the Government on the 18 August that all sporting events take place behind closed doors, is not in any way a reflection on the quality of the GAA&rsquo;s facilities or the protocols put in place by the GAA to ensure the safety of the players, officials and the general public. </p>  <p>  The overall Government approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  As society and the economy have begun to open up, there has been a gradual change in the epidemiological situation  across the country, and the NPHET advised the Government that a cautious but measured approach be taken. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the NPHET recommended that all sporting events can continue to take place but behind closed doors. It is also advised that participants should practice 2 metre physical distancing before and after events, during breaks in play, on the side-lines and team huddles should be avoided. All necessary measures to comply with child protection still apply.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the NPHET that their concerns are not just around the risk associated with attendance at the games themselves, but also the risk of the spread of infection associated with people travelling to and gathering in different ways both before and after events that must be considered. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy therefore that the issue is not about spectators at matches, and it is not about targeting these restrictions at any cohort or sporting organisation in particular. We have had cases in clusters linked to sporting activities, but of more concern is the number of contacts of cases that have had to be followed up as a result of socialisation around sporting activity, house parties, other social engagements and car sharing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct when he states that the risk of transmission of the virus is lower outdoors, but it still exists, and the purpose of these measures is to prevent indoor and outdoor congregation, particularly where people from different households are mixing in a way that would spread the virus between households.</p>  <p>  It is of critical importance that a low level of community transmission be maintained in order to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable in our society and to protect the priorities of our essential societal services, such as education and health and social care services. By protecting these essential parts of our economy and society, we are also ensuring that sporting activity can continue for all.</p></reply>

The expert guidance of the ECDC in particular is based upon consideration of the circumstances arising in the European Union and globally. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reviews these international developments as part of its overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the disease. </p>  <p>  While Ireland has taken its cue from international organisations such as the WHO and the ECDC in how we look at metrics related to the pandemic, it must be said that whenever we make comparisons across countries, we must do this cautiously. Circumstances such as, for example, the socio-economic status of the population, population density, age profile, rates of underlying conditions, date of first reported cases, varying data collection methodologies and reporting arrangements, testing strategies etc are often not directly comparable or are very challenging to analyse in a manner that can be directly comparable. The path and timeline of each country&rsquo;s epidemic is also different. The metrics and policy responses used to combat the disease within each country have been unique to each country&rsquo;s own individual situation and context. Simply comparing numbers doesn&rsquo;t give the whole story. </p>  <p>  It is therefore difficult to make direct international comparisons as countries experience different stages/waves of the epidemic at different times. Overall, Ireland&rsquo;s response to this pandemic has been guided by international advice and emerging evidence and best practice. Information related to the current COVID-19 situation in Ireland and internationally is monitored continuously. </p>  <p>  We have been transparent and open in sharing the most current position daily via press releases, press conferences and a publicly accessible online dashboard. This pandemic has required a dynamic response and enormous efforts have been made to ensure that our national data collection has kept pace with this very rapidly changing situation. Sharing information with the public has also been carefully balanced with the need to maintain keeping patient confidentiality. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s 14-day incidence is now 40 per 100,000, up from a low of 3 in early July. Similarly, across the EU, most other member states seem to be experiencing an increase in their number of cases in recent weeks. Overall, the incidence rate is 55 cases per 100,000 population. 16 MS have a higher incidence rate in the past 2 weeks than in the previous 2-week period, while 11 member states have incidence rates above those currently  recorded in Ireland. </p></reply>

Together they share an integrated managerial and clinical governance system, as well as integrated patient care pathways and support functions.</p>  <p>  The Smaller Hospitals Framework identifies the activities that can be performed in Model 2 hospitals, like Monaghan Hospital. It provides for a stronger role for smaller hospitals, such as Monaghan Hospital, in delivering a higher volume of less complex care, often closer to a patient&rsquo;s home. It also ensures that patients who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in a larger hospital environment. </p>  <p>  The Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan Hospital Emergency Department is located in Cavan, with facilities in Monaghan focused on elective care and the appropriate streaming of patients to the Minor Injuries Unit.  These Minor Injury Units help to provide valuable services to local communities and alleviate the pressures on Emergency Departments; this will prove to be especially vital in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Other services provided at Monaghan Hospital include day services, theatre, diagnostic services, ambulatory care and a wide range of out-patient services.  It also has 20 rehabilitation in-patient beds and 11 step-down beds, providing an invaluable service to patients following discharge from acute hospital services.  </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented interruption to normal health services. The HSE continues to plan for the challenges of providing health services in the Covid-19 environment and the Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan Hospital will continue to play a critical role in the implementation of these plans.</p></reply>

The Act does not provide for automatic eligibility based on having a particular disease or illness.  However, the HSE does have a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months.</p><p>These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed.  </p><p>Individuals may also qualify for a medical card through the means assessment process. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where individuals exceed the income guidelines.</p><p>Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer. </p><p>I recognise however that not all terminally ill patients may qualify for a medical card and this understandably causes upset and concern.</p><p>To that end, the HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review this issue.

The report set out details of the Covid-19 planning undertaken at MUH as part of the overall work of the Saolta Healthcare Group, the considerable challenges faced at the outset and the actions taken to address these challenges. </p>  <p>  The report also recommended areas of further action that should be addressed in the context of Covid-19 at the hospital. The HSE advises that MUH is implementing the Covid-19 measures as set out in the report and all immediate term measures are now in place, including the full Covid-19 batch testing now being executed on site, with the longest turnaround time for a test result in the hospital now less than 24hrs.  A refurbishment programme of some existing ward accommodation has commenced and will complete in October 2020, resulting in improved facilities for patients. </p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that MUH is working through the Saolta Healthcare Group and with HSE Estates to progress with the capital development process to increase in-patient capacity on the hospital site. This includes completion of a feasibility study in relation to the development of a 50 bedded ward block.  In the interim, a temporary modular unit is progressing and is due to be on site by early November.  As part of the hospital&rsquo;s Winter Plan, MUH will utilise existing capacity in the new 40 bed acute ward in the Sacred Heart Hospital.</p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has put significant pressure on health facilities in Ireland and worldwide.

I fully acknowledge the distress and inconvenience for patients and their families when appointments are delayed.  </p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p>  <p>  In relation to outpatient waiting lists for Rheumatology in the mid-western area, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has advised my Department that they have approved a number of initiatives to improve waiting times for outpatient appointments in the University of Limerick Hospital Group. This includes 1,150 additional Rheumatology outpatient clinic appointments.</p></reply>

While some services were suspended or delivered on a reduced basis, it is important to recognise that many vital services have continued throughout the pandemic, ensuring that priority care needs were addressed and the most vulnerable protected even at the height of this crisis.</p>  <p>  Resuming health and social care services and building the health sector capacity and capability for the pressures of Winter 2020 and into 2021 is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  To ensure that services were restored in a prioritised manner with investments targeted at rebuilding services guided by Sl&aacute;intecare - shifting service provision from Hospital to community-based care, the HSE published in June 2020, a Strategic Framework for Delivery of Service Continuity in a COVID Environment. This ensures a safer environment for patients and service users.</p>  <p>  Over the summer period we have seen a gradual resumption of many of those services that were curtailed, although unfortunately there are still areas where the level of service falls below that which was being delivered up to mid-March. The immediate priority for the HSE is the finalisation of a Winter Plan that would incorporate the enhancement of services to cope with Winter pressures into early 2021 to ensure the capacity and capability of health system is prepared for this challenging period.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a more strategic approach to Service resumption is being undertaken, with the development of a longer-term plan to include augmented levels of service to regain a level of provision across community and acute hospitals that had capacity adversely impacted by COVID 19.  This would include establishing key community services envisioned in Sl&aacute;intecare and the 2018 Capacity Review, while building toward the appropriate level of capacity in our acute hospital services.</p>  <p>  As part of the Winter and Service Planning process,  a range of initiatives have also been developed, and as these are rolled out in the coming weeks and months, we will see further service resumption and increased capacity across the community (primary care, mental health, older persons and disability services) and Acute Hospital system.</p>  <p>  This will include implementing new initiatives, new ways of working and eHealth solutions to keep people safe and keep people out of the acute hospital system e.g. ePharmacy, ePrescribing and virtual clinics.</p>  <p>  For Mental Health Services, this year has been exceptional with the outbreak of Covid-19. The pandemic has been a source of significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world. This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.</p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, in so far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure the protection of patients and staff. To note, acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although numbers have been reduced in some settings.</p>  <p>  The advent of Covid-19 has led to a rapid acceleration in the delivery of online mental health services, with the Department of Health launching numerous initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing. Among these was the launch of the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psychosocial strategy. This will enable the Irish healthcare system to implement integrated telehealth solutions and to augment existing online interventions funded to date. An example of this is the free counselling sessions offered by HSE NGO partner MyMind and Turn2me created online peer support groups for frontline workers. </p>  <p>  Tele-psychiatry pilot projects have been tested to enable planning for the delivery of this service nationally to support those with complex mental health needs. This service will alignment and augment existing mental health services. </p>  <p>  To plan for the ongoing and increasing need for mental health services nationally and the demand for more holistic person-centred responses across the whole community, the refreshed national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision &ndash; A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, was published in June 2020. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the state without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten year plan.</p>  <p>  Regarding access to services for persons with special needs, adult day services as well as children&rsquo;s disability services were stepped down in March 2020 in line with government recommendations to minimise the spread of COVID 19.</p>  <p>  Adult day services have since been reopening over the last month and this will continue throughout September, and information on reopening dates for all 966 services has been available on the HSE&rsquo;s website since August 4th.</p>  <p>  When day services resume, capacity in day service locations will be reduced, however, the HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly. The HSE is committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions and providers are exploring options such as the use of other community facilities to augment capacity. </p>  <p>  For the foreseeable future, remote supports and supports provided from service user homes will become a key feature of day service provision. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, children&rsquo;s disability services continued to be provided on the phone/online and also, face to face for some children and families with high prioritised needs, taking all of the required IPC precautions into account, and in line with HSE&rsquo;s Alternative Models of Support.  </p>  <p>  On July 31st, the HSE issued &ldquo;Guidance to Support Resumption of Children&rsquo;s Disability Services&rdquo; documentation to their individual Community Healthcare Organizations. These guidance documents are intended to support clinicians in decision making regarding disability assessments in the context of Covid-19 and secondly to support the return to more normal levels of service provision for children with disabilities and their families, who have been significantly impacted by measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Having received these guidance documents, all Community Healthcare Organizations should be putting appropriate arrangements in place to resume assessment of need and intervention therapy services in line with public health guidance.</p></reply>

However, it is necessary to reduce footfall in order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole. </p>  <p>  Maternity hospitals have performed well during the pandemic and have continued to keep women, babies and staff safe.  The fact that there have been no Covid maternal deaths in this country,and that we have a had a low incidence in pregnant women, suggests that the current approach is working.</p>  <p>  However, we must remain vigilant as services resume and higher numbers of people attend hospitals. Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.  In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review.</p></reply>

This resulted in construction related work on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital stopping on 31 March this year due to Covid-19 Restrictions.  On 18<sup>th</sup>May the restrictions in respect of the construction sector were eased.  From this date, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) engaged with the main contractor to ensure the earliest possible reopening of the sites.  I am informed that the main contractor of the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital project returned to site on the 13<sup>th</sup>of July.  There will be delays associated with Covid-19,  however it is too early to fully assess the impact of the pandemic on the new children&rsquo;s hospital project and the Paediatric Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Tallaght. The NPHDB continues to engage with the contractor and is monitoring progress on site in the interests of completing the project as quickly and economically as possible. </p><p>On that note I want to say that I am acutely aware of how urgently the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital is needed and I want to see it delivered as quickly as possible on behalf of children, young people and their families. </p><p>Under the contract, the new children&rsquo;s hospital is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open in 2023 after a period of commissioning.  As of March 2020, when the site closed due to Covid-19, I am advised that the NPHDB was of the view that the Main Contractor was behind schedule on the construction works.</p><p>The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the Main Contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments. Any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could potentially be a matter for dispute resolution and so I wish to be careful in respect of what I say here, but I will reiterate that it is a priority for me and this Government that the hospital be completed as quickly as possible. </p><p><b></b>The &euro; 1.73 billion figure raised by the Deputy is the total overall project cost advised to the previous Government in December 2018.That figure comprises &euro;1.43 billion which is the overall cost to complete the capital project, and also includes a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development. This includes for example investment in ICT, an Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme - the merging of three paediatric hospitals. </p><p>The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of further cost.  The residual risks, for which there cannot be cost certainty, include items such as construction inflation, claims and certain uncontrollable risks, such as potential costs relating to BREXIT.

In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. </p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.</p>  <p>  The 2018 investment in paediatric orthopaedics included funding to support transition of adolescents with scoliosis from CHI at Crumlin to the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH). CHI and MMUH have developed and agreed the clinical pathways for the transition of adolescents with scoliosis to MMUH. The transition of patients over the age of 16 who were awaiting a first-time outpatient/spinal review appointment at Crumlin commenced in December 2018. Each month, appropriate patients are identified for this pathway via clinical validation. </p>  <p>  CHI have advised my Department that the introduction of government restrictions for COVID-19 based on public health advice required CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street to defer all non-emergency spinal operations. CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street have now resumed services on an incremental basis.</p>  <p>  Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) requirements have material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, significantly impacting on the overall capacity and operational activity levels for inpatient / outpatient settings. To the end of August 2020, 177 scoliosis procedures had taken place, compared to 251 for the same period last year, marking a decrease in activity of 29%.</p>  <p>  At the end of August 2020 there were 218 scoliosis patients waiting for a spinal procedure at Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh Hospitals, across active, TCI (to come in) suspended and planned procedure categories. Of this number, 129 were awaiting spinal fusion procedures, while 89 were awaiting other spinal procedures.</p>  <p>  Additional initiatives are being explored to increase access to scoliosis treatment - CHI is working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh to transfer additional patients who meet the clinical criteria for treatment at Cappagh and in conjunction with the NTPF, sourcing additional theatre space.  </p>  <p>  Scoliosis services, waiting lists, and activity levels are specifically monitored by the Scheduled Care Performance Unit in my Department, through weekly performance monitoring meetings which are attended by representatives from CHI, and through continued engagement between Department and HSE officials.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.</p>  <p>  The focus of the Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy is on achieving best outcomes for people, by providing safe, high quality, person-centred care at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres, where necessary. The framework will guide the reconfiguration and development of neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level, through a 10-step Framework. It proposes the formation of Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Networks (MCRNs), with the set-up of one demonstration MCRN suggested as the first step. The ultimate goal of this approach is to put in place a national framework of acute, inpatient and specialist community services.</p>  <p>  The Managed Clinical Rehabilitation Network (MCRN) model acknowledges that different service users need different input and different levels of expertise and specialisation at different stages in their rehabilitation journey.</p>  <p>  The critical point of this model is that, although service users may need to access different services as they progress, the transition between services should be facilitated by appropriate communication and sharing of information between services so that they progress in a seamless continuum of care through the different stages:</p>  <p>  - Acute hospital;</p>  <p>  - Complex specialist rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Post-acute specialist inpatient rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Community based specialist rehabilitation services;</p>  <p>  - Primary care; and</p>  <p>  - Voluntary organisations.</p>  <p>  This National Implementation Framework is evidence-based and informed by population needs. It addresses the continuum of care for those in need of neurological rehabilitation services. It describes the requirement for a whole system approach and provides the blueprint for how we should deliver care and services for those who suffer from neurological conditions who require individualised, goal focused rehabilitation.</p>  <p>  The implementation framework covers an initial period from 2019 into 2021. However, it is recognised that continued investment in and development of neuro-rehabilitation services will need to be prioritised beyond the three-year implementation period of this Implementation Framework.</p>  <p>  In relation to health needs, HSE Disability Services provide personal and social supports based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific diagnosis or condition.</p>  <p>  In general services for people with neurological conditions are delivered within the context of Primary Care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions, where appropriate. However, people with neurological conditions may also benefit from Specialist Disability Services such as assisted living services.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant and Home Support Services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</p>  <p>  PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p>  <p>  Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available.  As with every service there is not a limitless resource available for the provision of home support services and while the resources available are substantial they are finite.  In this context, services are discretionary and the number of hours granted is determined by other support services already provided to the person/family.</p>  <p>  As the issues raised are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive (HSE)  to reply directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This freed up resources at Tallaght to support the adult service there in responding to the demands of COVID and meant that some CHI staff, on a voluntary basis, worked in the adult services supporting their colleagues, including in ICU, during this very challenging period. </p>  <p>  This was a temporary measure, and paediatric services at Tallaght have now resumed. CHI advises this began with the return of outpatients in July. A 24/7 emergency care unit, medical inpatient care and day case surgery, medicine and x-ray resumed on site from 3 September. Tallaght will now take on increased day surgeries instead of resuming in-patient surgeries,creating theatre capacity in Temple St and Crumlin for surgeries that can only be undertaken in those hospitals. Additionally, critically ill and critically injured children will be directed to the CHI Emergency Departments at Crumlin and Temple Street. </p>  <p>  Patient safety is central to CHI&rsquo;s decision making, both in the provision and development of services. This approach is designed to ensure that resources across all CHI sites at Tallaght, Crumlin, Temple Street and Connolly are utilised as effectively as possible to maximise the level of service provided and ensure the delivery of safe, high quality services.  This is crucial in the context of what is expected to be a challenging winter for paediatric services.</p></reply>

With regards to the specific details, I will first deal with mesh implants and then consider sodium valproate. </p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in response to concerns raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the matter. The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause was instigated pending implementation of initial recommendations regarding (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The CMO report was published in November 2018. Four of the 19 recommendations relate to data gathering to support the development of information resources to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate arrangements for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.  The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. </p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) receives adverse incidents reported in Ireland with respect to mesh products.  It is working with the National Women and Infants Health Programme on a national reporting guidance document, for adverse incident reporting associated with uro-gynaecological mesh. This new guidance is expected to be finalised and published in the coming weeks.  It requests that Healthcare Professionals including consultants, GPs and national mesh administrators report adverse events associated with vaginal mesh implants to the HPRA. </p>  <p>  The HPRA is also involved other related areas of work. It is leading work in Europe to create a device specific vigilance guidance with respect to mesh products to standardise reporting with respect to these products. It is conducting a market surveillance review into transvaginal mesh products used for stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse, in addition to supporting a European taskforce relating to mesh products. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the medicine, sodium valproate, I am aware of historical and current issues surrounding the use of sodium valproate by women during pregnancy. I am also aware of the significant work carried out by the HSE and the HPRA over the last two years to implement European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations from 2018 and to provide support to families who may have concerns about previous exposure to sodium valproate and the possible impact on their children.</p>  <p>   As I understand it, the HSE has improved the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome (FVS), including the establishment of a dedicated genetics clinic in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin. This means that families now have access to a clear diagnostic pathway if they feel their child may be affected by FVS. </p>  <p>  As regards the UK report referred to by the Deputy, any relevant learnings from that review will be taken into account as my Department continues to work with the HSE, the HPRA, and other stakeholders to support successful implementation of the current regulatory framework and risk mitigation measures for valproate and implementation of the recommendations of the CMO&rsquo;s report on the use of use of Uro-Gynaecological Mesh in Surgical Procedures.</p></reply>

The HSE's overall testing approach continues to evolve in accordance with the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Ireland.</p><p>I have been informed that where healthcare workers, including home support workers, require a test, they are prioritised and there is no delay in scheduling a test appointment.</p><p>You will appreciate that testing is only one element of a comprehensive strategic response to COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. </p><p>Targeted, risk-based testing can yield important data to inform control measures but does not constitute a control measure in and of itself.  A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic must therefore include a strong focus on infection prevention and control and additional measures such as prompt identification and exclusion from work of symptomatic healthcare workers for example.</p><p>Appropriate infection prevention and control practice across the home care sector will therefore continue to be an important protection for clients and health care workers from COVID-19.</p></reply>

The Review identified an immediate requirement for 1,290 beds to address overcrowding and to ensure hospitals operated at 85% occupancy in line with other OECD countries. The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country. In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597 excluding critical care capacity. It should be noted that this is the total current bed capacity. However, beds are unavailable when they are temporarily closed for reasons such as infection control, maintenance/refurbishment, or staffing shortages.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional beds for three months to the end of March 2020 at a cost of &euro;5.8 million. The HSE confirmed 197 of those beds had opened as planned. A further extension of this agreement has been approved until the 31st December 2020 at an estimated cost of &euro;12 million. </p>  <p>  Furthermore the HSE has indicated additional surge capacity of general acute beds of 1,633 in the event of a rise in Covid cases. </p>  <p>  In relation to critical care capacity, the Health Service Capacity Review 2018 recommended that it be increased to 430 beds by 2031 (an additional 190 critical care beds). In early 2020, baseline permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland was reported by the National Office of Clinical Audit (NOCA) to be 255 beds. Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds, and two paediatric critical care beds, was provided as part of the response to Covid-19 in March 2020. </p>  <p>  Surge ICU capacity supports the provision of critical care as required. Daily situational reports published by the HSE during recent months have reported potential critical care beds including surge as in the region of 430, with the number open on any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff. My Department and the HSE have been engaging in regard to critical care capacity requirements in the public hospital system. </p>  <p>  The future opening of additional acute and critical care bed capacity will be considered in the context of the Estimates discussions for the years concerned and on the priorities in the HSE's National Service Plans for those years.   </p></reply>

Research indicates that the requirement to pay a charge results in lower uptake rates among those in the at-risk groups who do not hold Medical or GP Visit cards.  </p>  <p>  Given the potential for the winter flu season in 2020/2021 to coincide with a resurgence of COVID, and the importance of minimising hospital attendance, the Government is expanding the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, and to all children aged from 2 to 12 years.</p>  <p>  It is proposed to administer the vaccines via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years.  Given the importance of significantly increasing the level of uptake of the vaccine for the coming winter, resources will be provided to GPs and pharmacists not only to deliver the vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics.</p>  <p>  The expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access to vaccination without charges. By providing vaccination to those most at-risk, and those most likely to require hospitalisation if they contract influenza, it is anticipated that the programme will see a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions, as well as a reduction in the overall spread of influenza in the community.</p>  <p>  The total influenza vaccination programme in 2020 is expected to cost approximately &euro;77 million, with approximately &euro;61.5 million of that cost associated with the expansion of the programme. It is not possible to estimate the cost of expanding the influenza programme to provide vaccine administration without charge to the entire population, as the calculation would depend on too many variables such as the type and quantity of vaccine to be procured as well as the rate of vaccine uptake. </p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction.    </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice.    </p>  <p>  Day Care services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months.   </p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

This position is consistent with the Recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources. My Department, the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) and the National Cancer Screening Service will keep emerging international evidence under review including the results of randomised trials that are currently being conducted internationally.</p><p>The NCCP is working to enhance access to early diagnosis and multi-disciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer. In this regard, Rapid Access Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Clinics have been established in each of the eight designated cancer centres. Patients at higher risk are fast-tracked to these clinics, and those patients who receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer  have immediate access to a multidisciplinary specialist cancer consultation regarding appropriate management.  </p><p>A National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC) was established in 2019. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p><p>As part of its body of work the Committee will implement an agreed methodology for accepting applications to consider new, or revisions to, existing population-based screening programmes in Ireland.</p><p>The addition of any new population-based screening programmes will be incorporated as part of the Committee's work programme following a robust, methodologically sound and detailed analysis of the evidence in each and every case against internationally accepted screening criteria. </p><p>Updates in relation to screening will be posted on the NSAC website (). </p><p>Furthermore, anyone who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact their GP for appropriate referral. </p></reply>

The formal ratification process for the wider Agreement will require ratification by individual Member States, because it contains elements which fall under both EU competence and Member State competence.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, there is real concern in Ireland about the potential impact of the agreement, arising in particular from the inclusion of a 99,000-tonne tariff rate quota for beef. Throughout the period of negotiation we consistently sought to minimise the impact of any potential deal on the Irish and European beef sector, and we continue to voice our concerns in this respect.</p>  <p>  The European Commission engaged the London School of Economics to carry out a &ldquo;Sustainability Impact Assessment&rdquo; on the agreement, the draft final report of which was published on 8th July 2020. This EU study is being augmented at national level by a whole-of-Government review announced by former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar T.D. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in collaboration with my Department, commissioned the Implement Consulting Group to carry out this Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment (ESIA) for Ireland. This report is due presently.</p>  <p>  The final outcome of both studies will inform Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the discussions in the coming months, and to the ratification process.</p></reply>

The Government is very committed to its reform as set out in the Programme for Government including the introduction of new legislation to align the planning and appeal processes with best practice in similar processes elsewhere. We need a system that  works better for all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.</p>  <p>  My Department now has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. The early results of the project plan are showing progress with the felling licenses issued in August the highest for some 13 months in both volume and area. Clearly we have more work to do but the early signs are promising.</p>  <p>   A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this plan a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced which aims to increase efficiencies in the appeals process. My Department is currently reviewing the almost 9,000 submissions received on the Bill before its presentation tio the House very soon for consideration here. Our analysis so far of submissions received shows that  a majority support the introduction of the Bill and the proposals therein.</p>  <p>  I know  that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

A phased programme for the infrastructural development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been progressed over the last number of years. In total, approximately &euro;31m has been invested in capital developments at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC between 2000 and 2019. In addition, in excess of &euro;1.5m has been allocated for capital works in the harbour in 2020.</p>  <p>  The possibility of a deep-water berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been mooted for some time. The Department commissioned DKM consultants to conduct a Cost Benefit Analysis into the development of a deep water quay at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  A draft report was submitted to the Department in June 2017.  Since the report was drafted, there have been changes to some of the fundamentals underpinning the original analysis.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the Department subsequently commissioned engineering consultants to undertake a review of the design solutions, scoping options and operational aspects of a possible future project. An interim draft of the Quay Wall Peer Review Report was received in April 2019. This report identified the need for additional site investigations to be carried out in Ros an Mh&iacute;l. </p>  <p>  These site investigation works were carried out in August/September 2019 and have now been completed. The final Quay Wall Peer Review report was received on the 27th July 2020 and a further update was issued on the 4th of Sept 2020. The Department will now consider this report including the site investigation results to inform a future assessment of possible design solutions and scoping options, which will, in themselves, inform any future decision on progressing this project. </p>  <p>  While planning permission is in existence, a detailed design may have to be undertaken along with a comprehensive costing exercise and a potential further Cost Benefit Analysis before any decision is made to progress this project. As a consequence, it was not possible to include this project in the July stimulus package and, as is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres generally, any future decision with regard to formally initiating this project in Ros an Mh&iacute;l will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

The agri-food supply chain stretches from rural and coastal areas all across Ireland to the UK, Europe and further to markets in the Americas, Asia and Africa. In 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s food and agri-foods products were exported to over 180 markets worldwide and valued at &euro;14.5 billion, a 63% increase from &euro;8.9 billion in 2010.  The sector is thriving and continues to evolve and meet the needs of its customers, domestically and internationally.</p>  <p>  While the sector faces significant challenges such as COVID-19, Brexit, and trade uncertainty in general, environmental concerns, and future CAP and CFP reform; the sector also has many opportunities to develop further and prosper. We have a strong international reputation as a supplier of safe, nutritious and sustainably produced food. International consumers seek out our food and beverage products in what is a very competitive international market. We should be proud of this and work to build and enhance that reputation for the benefit of our farmers, fishers and all other stakeholders within the sector.</p>  <p>  The agri-food sector has been well served over the last 20 years by having a series of ten-year strategies to guide its development and we have committed in the Programme for Government that this should continue with the preparation of a new strategy to 2030. A Committee of sector stakeholders has been working since late last year on this new strategy. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. </p>  <p>  Last week, I met with the Chair of the Committee to discuss progress and spoke with the Committee members also, and I am satisfied that their work will  make a very important contribution to ensuring the future viability and development of the agri-food sector.  The Programme for Government has committed to publishing the strategy within six months of Government formation. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, work continues under Food Wise 2025, the current strategy for the agri-food sector. The implementation process for Food Wise is driven by a High Level Implementation Committee. I look forward to chairing my first meeting of that Committee on Thursday, where the focus will  be on our ongoing response to COVID and Brexit.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I will ensure that my Department continues to assist the Sector through the provision of significant financial support from the CAP, the CFP and National funding.  I will also ensure that its Agencies continue to provide support for research and innovation, for marketing and for investment where this is needed.</p></reply>

It is an issue that is at the top of my agenda, and I have already met with some of the farm bodies since my appointment to hear their views.  </p>  <p>  The issue is somewhat complicated by the ongoing delay in the adoption of the transitional rules, which is not now expected until late October at the earliest. Budgetary details will have to be incorporated into the regulations after agreement on the EU budget has been reached with the European Parliament, and the duration of the transition period - one or two years - is also still to be finally agreed. </p>  <p>  Regarding the plans for the existing schemes under the Rural Development Programme, no final decisions will be made, including in relation to agri-environment schemes, until we have clarification on budget and duration.</p>  <p>  On convergence and other proposals, these will require further consideration, and I am currently consulting widely on these matters. We will need to ensure that what we do in the transitional period is consistent with Programme for Government commitments, as well as providing a solid foundation for the development of our CAP Strategic Plan for the period to 2027. In addition, the very ambitious targets set out in the EU Bio-Diversity Strategy and Farm to Fork Strategy will have to be taken into account.  </p>  <p>  I intend to continue my meetings with the farm bodies and stakeholders over the coming weeks to hear their views.  I am also conscious that we have very limited time to make decisions and implement workable solutions.</p></reply>

This strategy outlines the significant potential for growth of our agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  My Department has been and continues to be very active in securing access to new third country markets for Irish food companies. To that end, our food and drink exports have greatly increased in recent years. Total Irish agri-food exports came to &euro;14.5 billion in 2019, an increase of 6% on 2018. Bord Bia has indicated that half of this growth has come from markets outside of Europe. </p>  <p>  Trade missions play a key role in market and trade advancement.  In recent years, successful visits have taken place  to Turkey, China, Japan, South Korea, Algeria and Egypt, among others. Increased market access opportunities and developments have been achieved with these visits, including the abolition of the age restriction on beef exports to Japan, additional beef plant approvals for export to China and the progression of beef access in South Korea. Destinations are selected strategically and in keeping with the Bord Bia market prioritisation exercise of December 2017. </p>  <p>  The Government's focus on, and commitment to, new market development has been illustrated by its appointment of my colleague, Martin Heydon T.D., as  Minister of State with specific responsibility for this task.

This represents a marginal increase on our current 2014-2020 allocation. It includes a special Rural Development allocation of more than &euro;330m, in current prices. </p>  <p>  The European Council agreement is a major step forward in finalising the CAP budget.  However, work remains to be done. The funding package is a complex one, with additional mechanisms including the new European Recovery Instrument. This is also the case for the CAP budget, which has a number of elements including Pillar 1 (direct payments), Pillar 2 (rural development), special allocations for Member States (including Ireland) and European Recovery Instrument funding which will be spent under the rural development heading. Discussion is still ongoing in Brussels on some of the detail, including the timeframe for allocation of the European Recovery Instrument funding.   </p>  <p>  The budgetary package must now be agreed with the European Parliament, and I am hopeful of an early agreement in order to give certainty to farmers in realtion to funding and provide the foundation for an agreement on the post-2020 CAP.</p></reply>

Some of the recommendations contained in the report have been put in place or in the process of being put in place.  One of the most significant recommendations concerns the introduction of an independent Agriculture Appeals Review Panel to include private individuals which will require amendment to primary legislation. The current Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Agriculture Appeals Review Panel in legislation.  </p>  <p>  A new Director has been recently appointed to the Agriculture Appeals Office and the further implementation of the recommendations including the establishment of an Independent Review Panels is currently under consideration.</p></reply>

The Protocol is clear, and the Commission have confirmed this, that the movement of animals between Northern Ireland and the EU is treated the same as intra-EU movements.</p>  <p>  This is possible because the Protocol provides that relevant EU law applies to and in Northern Ireland.

A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this plan a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced which aims to increase efficiencies in the appeals process. My Department is currently reviewing the almost 9,000 submissions received on the Bill before its presentation tio the House very soon for consideration here. Our analysis so far of submissions received shows that a majority support the introduction of the Bill and the proposals therein.</p>  <p>  I know that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p>  <p>  Regarding the forestry licence statistics requested, my Department publishes a range of data on its website.  Due to the extent and nature of data sought it will be supplied to the Deputy separately in written form.</p></reply>

This has continued in 2020 with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence (on a 12-month rolling basis) has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000 &ndash; the highest number since 2009.  These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes.  It is this need for action that is my Department&rsquo;s primary motivation in issuing the herd history statements.</p>  <p>  Whilst the immediate trends are disappointing and worrying, great progress has been made over the past decade. During 2009, 5,860 herds were subject to restriction whilst the number in 2019 was 4,060.  By working together, we have made progress before and we can do so again.  I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by farmers and I am eager to schedule a TB Forum meeting next week to further develop a shared understanding of how collectively we can reduce TB incidence.  </p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to reducing TB in Ireland as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 officers to assist the TB Programme. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective and from a trade perspective at national and at international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned. It is a deep regret that today over 2,700 herds are currently restricted which represents a 21% increase on the same time last year. I want to work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this on-going cost on farmers and the State.</p></reply>

This is a very important Bill which is intended to improve and reform the forestry appeals process.  As is well known, the urgent need for such reform is evident from the delays being experienced on hearings which is not in the interest of any stakeholder. This Bill allows for more efficiencies in the Forestry Appeals Committee's work by aligning it with best practice in other planning and appeals processes. </p>  <p>  My Department has received almost 9,000 submissions which shows that this is an issue which has generated intense public interest. There are a a range of views expressed but our analysis to date indicates that a significant majority support the introduction of the Bill and the measures therein. These will all be published on the Department's website once they have been reviewed. I would like to assure the House that all contributions are being carefully considered for the drafting of the final Bill, which will be presented to the House as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I am also continuing to improve the system by continuously reviewing the resource requirements to the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC).  Additional resources have been assigned to the FAC, including additional administrative resources and personnel with planning expertise, to assist with administering appeals. These will be added to in the near future.  We are also introducing an on-line portal for easy access to view all licence applications.</p>  <p>  I believe that the proposed Bill, along with our Project Plans for managing the licencing backlog, will greatly improve the overall system and result in an increase in the number of licences available for planting and felling. </p>  <p>  It is clear to me that greater dialogue must be an essential element of future policy-making on forestry in this country. The views of all stakeholders are important but equally important is that they're communicating them directly to each other in a constructive and open dialogue. It is for this reason that I intend to reform the Forestry Programme Implementation Group to help me as Minister on the implementation of the current Programme and other relevant policy issues. I intend to make further announcements on this in the very near future.</p></reply>

The Scheme operated over three months June to August inclusive, and allowed vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months each.  The Scheme was intended as a safety net scheme to assist fishermen who did not consider fishing to be economically viable during a temporary period of market disturbance and weak prices.  The Scheme supported the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and as such was designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme were based on official data derived from fishing vessel owners as part of the EU Data Collection Framework.  Support payments for inshore vessel owners ranged from &euro;800 per month for vessels between 10 and 12 metres, &euro;750 per month for vessels between 8 and 10 metres and &euro;500 per month for vessels under 8 metres.  </p>  <p>  For the month of June, some 67 vessels chose to tie up, of which 52 were inshore boats, for July 61 vessels of which 46 were inshore boats and for August 19 vessels of which 14 were inshore boats.  Altogether some 147 tie-up payments were approved, of which 112 were inshore boats, although in some instances two payments were made to the same vessel owner where that person opted to tie up for two months.</p></reply>

Against this background, the Department developed individualised reports that provide a simplified TB herd risk category for farmers, with herd-specific advice on how to reduce risk of TB.

I am acutely aware of these issues.

The clarifications brought about by these cases have resulted in the Department introducing a revised Appropriate Assessment Procedure for forestry licensing.</p>  <p>  These changes in process are very significant, but unavoidable, and have led to delays in the issue of licences, as most files now require 2nd stage Appropriate Assessment.  The delay in issuing licences is not the only delaying factor as there is also a third-party right of appeal on any licence granted.  There are approximately 350 cases currently on the books of the Forestry Appeals Committee with this number growing.  </p>  <p>  My Department is doing everything it can to address this backlog including significant investment in resources such as the recruitment of new ecologists and forestry inspectors.  My immediate priority is to reform the legislation underpinning the forestry appeals system and align it with best practice in other licencing and appeals processes.

It includes a special Rural Development allocation of more than &euro;330m, in current prices. </p>  <p>  The European Council agreement represents a significant step towards finalising the EU budget as a whole, including future CAP funding. However, it is a complex package, and the process is not yet fully concluded. There are new mechanisms to be considered, including the operation of the European Recovery Instrument, which has been added as a response to the EU-wide economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. There are also a number of different elements to CAP funding, including Pillar 1 (direct payments), Pillar 2 (rural development) and the rural development component of the European Recovery Instrument, which now have to be finalised and agreed with the European Parliament.   </p>  <p>  The engagement with the European Parliament has now commenced, and I hope there will be early agreement so that we can finally provide certainty to farmers in relation to funding, and lay the foundations for agreement on the next CAP framework.</p></reply>

Farmers are already provided with information in relation to their TB risk, but this new report presents this in a very much more user friendly, detailed and practical form. </p>  <p>  Following many successful years of reducing bovine TB levels to the benefit of Irish farmers, there has been a concerning incremental increase in the disease since 2016. This has continued in 2020 with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence (on a 12-month rolling basis) has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 20,000 &ndash; the highest number since 2009.  These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes.  It is this need for action that is my Department&rsquo;s primary motivation in issuing the herd history statements.</p>  <p>  Whilst the immediate trends are disappointing and worrying, great progress has been made over the past decade. During 2009, 5,860 herds were subject to restriction whilst the number in 2019 was 4,060.  By working together, we have made progress before and we can do so again.  I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by farmers following the issuance of these letters and I am eager to schedule a TB Forum meeting as soon as possible to further develop a shared understanding of how collectively we can reduce TB incidence.  </p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to reducing TB in Ireland as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 officers to assist the TB Programme. Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective and from a trade perspective at national and at international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned. It is a deep regret that today over 2,700 herds are currently restricted which represents a 21% increase on the same time last year. I want to work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this on-going cost on farmers and the State.</p></reply>

In the course of preparing the application, Bord Bia consulted with stakeholders including through their Meat and Livestock Board, and also consulted with individual groups and the Beef Task Force.   </p>  <p>  The PGI application is based on the reputation and quality of &ldquo;Irish Grass Fed Beef&rdquo;, which are a consequence of the predominantly outdoor pasture grazing production system.  </p>  <p>  One of the legal requirements for a PGI application is a 'National Opposition Period' prior to its final submission to the Commission.  The closing date for submission of oppositions was 11 September.  Submissions received are now being considered by my Department. There will be further opportunity for discussion with stakeholders following this, including at the upcoming meeting of the Beef Taskforce. </p>  <p>  The next stage of the process will be submission of a final application to the European Commission.  The application will then be subject to detailed scrutiny by the EU and an opposition procedure will be provided by the EU for other Member States and third countries. If there was a satisfactory outcome, the application would be progressed for registration of the PGI.  </p>  <p>  Our Irish grass fed beef is a respected product nationally and internationally, and that reputation is a reflection of the sustained efforts of farmers and all of those involved in striving to achieve the highest level of quality for our beef products. I welcome the opportunity provided by the EU Protected Geographical Indication scheme to assist Ireland in further communicating the characteristics and reputation of this quality product and importantly to protect that reputation from imitation.</p></reply>

The meeting was chaired by Mr Peter Duggan, Acting CEO, Mayo Co. Council. The meeting was attended by a range of regional stakeholders including those representing enterprise and sectoral development agencies, the LEOs, the local authorities, the third level and further education sector, N&amp;amp;W Regional Assembly and Western Development Commission. </p><p>The main focus of the meeting was to gather considered views from those present on the enterprise impacts of COVID-19 and to review the continued relevance of current objectives and actions in the West Regional Enterprise Plan given new economic challenges for the region and nationally. This Plan covers the counties of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</p><p>The meeting heard a report back on the reviews from the working groups driving each of the Objectives in the current Regional Enterprise Plan since the previous meeting in July. The areas identified as of key importance over the coming months are as follows:</p><p>- Increasing Life Science capability in the West region;</p><p>- Attracting a wider tourism audience including the development of a &lsquo;hybrid&rsquo; model for business tourism;</p><p>- Pivoting of the creative assets in the West to identify potential areas of growth;</p><p>- Establishing the region as an Ag Tech hub identifying niche opportunities;</p><p>- Addressing the Skills needs  for the region with adaptable approaches in supporting Apprenticeships, adult learning and the Tertiary sector; and</p><p>- Extending the utilisation of Enterprise Centres and Hubs in the region to support remote working</p><p>It was agreed that the individual reports from each working group/theme would be drawn together in a unified document and submitted to my Department for input to considerations in the preparation of the forthcoming National Economic Plan.</p><p>As part of the meeting, the IDA representative provided an update on the job losses at Aptar, Ballinasloe and outlined IDA engagement with the company and all the relevant Agencies. He also confirmed that the Job Loss Protocol that is in place with DEASP has been activated.</p><p>During the subsequent discussion Galway LEO confirmed that the LEO is available to support any Aptar worker who might wish to start their own business. Galway ETB also detailed that they are available to provide many different types of training assistance to the individual staff members from Aptar.  </p><p>As regards specific measures being undertaken by IDA to support Aptar and jobs in Ballinasloe these have included, since June 24th:</p><p>- Ongoing engagements with the local management of Aptar Ballinasloe; </p><p>- Ongoing engagements and support from IDA to employee representatives; </p><p>- Engagement with Enterprise Ireland regarding potential for local sourcing of suppliers or to seek interest in the Ballinasloe plant from Enterprise Ireland companies, in collaboration with the Enterprise Ireland Global Sourcing team; </p><p>- IDA West Regional team has connected the local Intreo and ETB with employees of Aptar;</p><p>- Following the decision by Aptar Global to close the Ballinasloe plant, a number of introductions to interested parties have been made to Aptar by IDA.</p><p>There are also a number of ongoing and planned Actions:</p><p>- IDA and Enterprise Ireland plan to use the Aptar Employee skills audit and plant layout as marketing collateral to attract new investment to Ballinasloe and to assess potential interest from existing FDI clients, particularly in Pharma, MedTech  and Engineering sectors;</p><p>- IDA&rsquo;s overseas office has ongoing engagement at corporate level with Aptar Global.  </p></reply>

My primary concern, as always in these situations, is for the workers and families who have been impacted by this decision. Many of these workers have been with the company for many years. The Government will make every State support available to those affected in order to help them transition and find new employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  The IDA have worked hard to sustain and support the firm&rsquo;s presence here and have had close and regular contact with management, both at a local and corporate level. The IDA also provided support to employee representatives as they put together a plan for efficiency savings that could be made in the Ballinasloe plant. </p>  <p>  Now that the decision has been taken to close the facility, The IDA is working closely with the company to market the plant to potential investors. This process is still ongoing. Both the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will use the employee skills audit in their efforts to attract new investment to Ballinasloe. The IDA Regional team has also connected the local Intreo office and the Education and Training Board with employees of Aptar. </p>  <p>  The West Regional Enterprise Plan Steering Committee met on 31 July and 8 September and considered the range of economic challenges and the impact of jobs losses in the region, including at Aptar. The committee was updated by the IDA and other regional agency representatives, and finalised options for additional measures that can be taken in to mitigate the COVID-19 and wider economic challenges in the region.</p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies have also been working hard, over a sustained period, to support job creation in the regions. This has included setting ambitious targets to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country. Last year, there were over 21,000 people employed in IDA-supported firms in Galway. This is almost double the number employed in 2010 (11,235). While the period ahead may prove more challenging, an important objective will remain securing new foreign direct investment for the County. </p>  <p>  Wider enterprise efforts are also underway to generate new growth in Galway and the surrounding area. For example, regional stakeholders &ndash; including Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and the Higher and Further Education Institutes &ndash; are working together on implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plan for the West. This is aimed at strengthening the environment for job creation in the region and Ballinasloe will also benefit from this. </p>  <p>  Another important initiative in this context is the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, through which over &euro;16.7m in funding for the West &ndash; over three competitive calls &ndash; has been approved for collaborative regional enterprise projects. The region has had particular recent success, with five Galway-based projects being awarded a total of &euro;9.6m. These projects are currently being developed and their completion will enhance the attractiveness of the area for further investment and job creation. </p>  <p>  While the announcement of job losses at Aptar is deeply disappointing, I want to assure you that the Government and its agencies are working to create employment opportunities in the West and across all of our regions.</p></reply>

Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure high quality jobs but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It therefore remains an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to regional locations.</p>  <p>  The IDA Ireland Athenry Strategic Site is a key asset in the Agency's property portfolio and forms part of the Strategic Economic Corridor in the Galway County Development Plan.  The site is concept master planned and all available lands are marketed to prospective investors through the IDA's network of offices in Ireland and overseas. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the IDA completed a Phase 2 infrastructure project in 2018 which consisted of further access infrastructure of two new bridges over the R348 and the Dublin to Galway railway line. This project also included the extension of access infrastructure to service the northern portion of the Athenry site. </p>  <p>  The IDA is currently progressing a further technical design review for a Phase 3 project. This includes the delivery of treated water and disposal waste water infrastructure. These works will require further capital investment and engagement with key stakeholders including the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), Irish Water and local authorities. </p>  <p>  County Galway has traditionally been a strong performer in terms of FDI and the IDA continues to draw the attention of clients looking to invest or expand in the County, including Athenry. Galway has seen an increase in employment numbers with over 850 net new jobs created by IDA Ireland client companies in 2019. The enterprise agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients and with one another to secure further investment and job creation for Galway and the West region.</p></reply>

We have listened to businesses and responded with a package of scale and speed to meet their most immediate needs.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant Plus is aimed at helping micro, small, and medium-sized businesses with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The scheme is designed to help with the cost of reopening or adapting business premises so that normal business can resume. The focus is on saving the business and employment by supporting it to start again.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant Plus is just one part of the wider suite of schemes available to firms of all sizes, which includes low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p>  <p>  On Monday the 14th of September I visited Kildare and announced a Scheme aimed at helping small businesses most acutely impacted by COVID-19 Restrictions. The Micro-Enterprise Assistance Fund will help businesses with fewer than 10 employees, which are ineligible for existing grants, with a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to help them adapt and invest to rebuild their business. About 2,000 businesses nationwide will benefit and businesses can apply through their Local Enterprise Office.</p>  <p>  All COVID-19 Business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate. In that regard, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine how best to further assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 as part of the forthcoming National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

Similarly, LEO Meath provides the same business supports throughout the County having engaged in numerous mentor assignments and training programmes for LEO clients based in East Meath. </p><p>I note that the Deputy has enquired about funding for a new LEO to cover the Drogheda and East Meath region.  He will be aware that when the LEO network was instituted under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014, a LEO was legally established on the basis of the functional area of the 31 County and City Councils in Ireland. This model, in operation for over 5 years, has been the platform for ongoing and incremental success in terms of client engagement and strong local jobs growth. </p><p>There are a wide range of Brexit supports available to further strengthen the capacity of our microenterprise sector such as:</p><p>- <b>The Brexit Mentor Programme</b>was developed for businesses to work with an experienced mentor on a one-to-one basis to identify key areas of exposure within their business and to maximise potential opportunities arising from Brexit.</p><p>- <b>Prepare Your Business for Customs</b>is a one-day interactive workshop, run regionally by Local Enterprise Offices, which provides all businesses with a better understanding of the potential impacts, formalities and  procedures to be adopted when trading with a country which is outside the  Single Market and Custom Unions.</p><p>- <b>LEAN for Micro</b>encourages businesses to adopt Lean business principles in their businesses to increase performance and competitiveness.

The Agency also continues to actively market it to clients considering investing or expanding in County Mayo. </p>  <p>  The IDA is assessing the potential of its land bank in the context of its upcoming new strategy. A revised planning permission application for this site in Mayo remains under consideration as part of that assessment.   </p>  <p>  To date, IDA Ireland has spent approximately &euro;383,800 on services for this site.

The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.  </p>  <p>  My Department has approved a number of supports that will assist the IDA in its efforts to attract further FDI. As part of the 2020 July Jobs Stimulus Package, the Government approved additional funding of &euro;10m for the IDA to undertake new marketing and promotional activities. The Government also announced funding of &euro;25m for the Covid Life Sciences Products Scheme which can be accessed by IDA clients to aid the research, development and production of medicinal products in Ireland that will be used in the fight against COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges posed by this pandemic, IDA Ireland's results for the first six months of this year have demonstrated the resilience of our FDI base. The Agency has secured over 130 investments to date in 2020, which have the potential to create almost 10,000 jobs. Almost half of these new projects were secured for locations outside Dublin, with 53 investments from companies investing in Ireland for the first time. </p>  <p>  I believe that these 2020 investments reflect our continuing attractiveness to overseas firms. Multinational companies continue to value our FDI strengths. These include our talented and flexible work-force, a track record as a successful home to global businesses and a hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction. Our continued commitment to the European Union, the single market and Eurozone, as well as to free trade and multilateralism, are other key selling points that help us convince multinational companies to establish operations and create jobs here.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, we do recognise that the global competition for FDI is intensifying and we are under no illusions that the time ahead will prove more challenging. We will have to fight, harder than ever before, for new investment projects and the jobs that go with them. I look forward, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to taking on that challenge. This will include working with the IDA on the formulation of a new strategy that will guide the Agency's work in the time ahead.</p></reply>

The LEOs' business mentors may be able to assist business owners, such as those mentioned, by identifying the appropriate assistance available to them such as:</p>  <p>  - Micro-finance Ireland (MFI) COVID-19 Loans, if the impact of COVID-19 has resulted in a reduction of 15% or more in turnover or profit, and the business is unable to secure finance from banks and commercial lending providers, the MFI COVID-19 Business Loan may be an option to help the business. These loans can be used for working capital or changes required by the business to manage COVID-19. MFI offers support in the form of business loans from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with 0% interest and zero repayments for the first 6 months and the business will receive a government rebate on interest paid in the following 6 months. If you apply for a COVID-19 loan through your LEO, the interest rate after the first 6 Months will be at a reduced rate of 4.5% APR.  MFI Loans typically have a 3-year loan term, with fixed repayments, no penalty for early repayment and no fees or charges.</p>  <p>  - The Trading Online Voucher scheme (TOVs), an initiative under the Government's National Digital Strategy that is actively promoted by the Local Enterprise Office on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The Scheme offers skills training, mentoring and financial support of up to &euro;2,500 to help small and micro-businesses to develop their ecommerce capability. New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one.</p>  <p>  On Monday the 14th of September I visited Kildare and announced a Scheme aimed at helping small businesses most acutely impacted by Covid-19 Restrictions. The Micro-Enterprise Assistance Fund will help businesses with fewer than 10 employees, which are ineligible for existing grants, with a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to help them adapt and invest to rebuild their business. About 2,000 businesses nationwide will benefit and businesses can apply through their Local Enterprise Office.</p></reply>

Therefore, businesses remaining closed and planning their re-opening can now receive a minimum of &euro;5,600 and a maximum of &euro;35,000 under the Restart Grant Plus. This can be used to help additional expense and adaptations associated with re-opening when the time comes.</p><p>Further measures include:</p><p>- Waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licenses in 2020; and,</p><p>- Waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licenses on renewal in 2020.</p><p>These measures are in addition to the existing Restart Grant Plus, Tourism Adaptation Fund, the wage subsidy scheme, commercial rates waiver, liquidity supports and tax measures (such as warehousing of tax debt and reduction in VAT). </p><p>As regards liquidity measures, such as the COVID-19 Loan Scheme by Microfinance Ireland, I am aware that many small businesses are reluctant to take on debt, but would nevertheless emphasise that the terms and conditions of these loans are significantly more favourable to small business borrowers than loans from commercial banks.  The fact that the first of these loan schemes is now fully subscribed and a second loan scheme has been launched attests to the fact that many small business owners are aware of these favourable conditions. </p><p>I launched the new Credit Guarantee Scheme on Monday 7th September, which is part of the Government&rsquo;s suite of supports for businesses that have been negatively impacted as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme will facilitate up to &euro;2 billion in lending to eligible businesses.</p><p>The Scheme offers a partial Government guarantee (80%) to participating finance providers against losses on qualifying finance agreements to eligible SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers.</p><p>It is designed to incentivise participating finance providers to continue to play their role in supporting the availability of additional liquidity to Irish businesses.</p><p>Loans under the Scheme range from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million, for terms of up to five-and-a-half years. Financing will be offered through a range of products, including term loans, working capital loans and overdrafts. Loans of up to &euro;250,000 under the Scheme are available unsecured (except where this is a requirement of the product feature, as in the case of asset finance, invoice discount facilities, etc).</p><p>The Government will continue to work with representative organisations and sectoral interests on finding solutions which conform with public health guidelines. </p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections published earlier this year, our 2020 emissions could be 2 to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of this compliance requirement were in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of credits required. The Department is currently in discussion with the NTMA in relation to purchasing additional carbon credits from the market to make up the expected shortfall.</p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Latest projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that between 12.5% and 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements are expected to be met from renewable sources by 2020. This is a very significant increase since 2005, when renewable energy was at just 3.1%. Nevertheless it is accepted that Ireland will not meet the 16% target.</p>  <p>  The Department is exploring the potential mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy targets within the framework of the Directive. Any requirement for statistical transfer purchases will be undertaken against a background of discussions with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.  The public data on trades in statistical allowances in 2017 between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggest potential costs for Ireland  in the order of &euro;110m, while the more recent agreement between the Netherlands and Denmark would suggest a significantly lower figure. However the cost of purchasing statistical transfers will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs at the time of the agreement. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to further increase our ambition, and halve our national carbon emissions over the course of the coming decade. As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law in the Climate Action Bill, which I aim to publish within the first 100 days of government. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set and will make the adoption of five-year carbon budgets, setting maximum emissions by sector, a legal requirement.</p></reply>

Wicklow was worked intermittently for approximately 250 years to extract copper and other metals, which were processed on site. The mine closed in 1982 but mineral extraction has left a number of health and safety issues as well as an environmental legacy.  </p>  <p>  A feasibility study undertaken by the Department in 2008 developed integrated rehabilitation and management plans for the site that address human and ecological concerns, safety and physical hazards, heritage, future uses and long-term site monitoring and management.  The overall estimated cost for the works included in the 2008 study was over &euro;50m with works envisaged to take place on a phased basis.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the feasibility study, my Department has prioritised recommendations that addressed the most critical safety, human health and environmental concerns at the site. To date, in excess of &euro;5 million has been expended on remediation and monitoring costs at the site. Works undertaken include: the capping of open shafts; addressing the stability of the Dublin Rosslare railway line which passes through the site; regrading and capping the mine waste area at Tigroney West and constructing surface drains to divert the surface flow around or across the capped area into the river and vegetating the capped surface.  A number of actions were also undertaken to preserve mining heritage features on the site, notably the complete rehabilitation of a pair of historic ore bins. </p>  <p>  As well as the health and safety work, environmental monitoring of the site is undertaken to ensure no significant change in conditions occurs without detection. An annual inspection of an underground tunnel, the 850 Adit, raised safety concerns about a section of the tunnel which passes under a local residential road.  This necessitated emergency repairs to the Adit between January and June 2020 to ensure its stability and expenditure associated with this highly specialised work will be in excess of &euro;900,000. </p>  <p>  The project is managed by a Project Board which comprises staff from my Department including Technical, Legal and Administrative staff. In relation to the long term plans for the site, work is now underway to begin a re-evaluation of the 2008 feasibility study and the approach to managing and restoring the site. The composition of the Project Board is being reviewed as part of this overall reappraisal.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The current deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>  Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties and steady progress is being made with over 89,000 premises surveyed as of 8 September. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. </p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP and will provide high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Over 130 BCP sites have been connected by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publically available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills (DES) for schools. Approximately 300 sites in rural areas are targeted for completion by the end of 2020 including 75 schools. The Department will work with DES to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.</p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.</p><p>The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working. The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections published earlier this year, our 2020 emissions could be 2 to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections. Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of this compliance requirement were in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of credits required. The Department is currently in discussion with the NTMA in relation to purchasing additional carbon credits from the market to make up the expected shortfall.</p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Latest projections by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that between 12.5% and 13.2% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements are expected to be met from renewable sources   by 2020. This is a very significant increase since 2005, when renewable energy was at just 3.1%. Nevertheless it is accepted that Ireland will not meet the 16% target.</p>  <p>  The Department is exploring the potential mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy targets within the framework of the Directive. Any requirement for statistical transfer purchases will be undertaken against a background of discussions with the EU Commission and relevant Member States.  The public data on trades in statistical allowances in 2017 between Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia suggest potential costs for Ireland  in the order of &euro;110m, while the more recent agreement between the Netherlands and Denmark (June 2020) would suggest a significantly lower figure. However the cost of purchasing statistical transfers will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs at the time of the agreement. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to further increase our ambition, and halve our national carbon emissions over the course of the coming decade. As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law in the Climate Action Bill, which I aim to publish within the first 100 days of government. The Bill will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set and will make the adoption of five-year carbon budgets, setting maximum emissions by sector, a legal requirement.  </p></reply>

Public sector vehicles have an important leadership role to play in this transition and will be strongly guided by the requirements under the EU&rsquo;s Clean Vehicles Directive. </p><p>The Clean Vehicles Directive provides for sustainable vehicle procurement by public authorities. It sets binding low- and zero-emission procurement targets by vehicle type, including cars, vans, trucks and buses. The Directive will apply to public contracts for vehicle purchase, lease, rental and hire-purchase from 2021 to 2030. Managing and funding this transition will be a matter for individual Government Departments, agencies and public bodies. I am pleased to see many public bodies already making the move to lower emitting, more efficient vehicles. </p><p>To assist with the transition towards electric vehicles (EVs), and pursuant with the<i>Climate Action Plan</i>, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has informed me that he is introducing a new public procurement framework contract which will allow public bodies to purchase EVs with a reduced administrative burden. These arrangements will be in place later in 2020. I expect that this measure will accelerate uptake of electric cars and light goods vehicles within the State vehicle fleet.</p><p>Within the Department of Transport, a comprehensive programme of work to &lsquo;green&rsquo; the vehicles within the public transport fleet is already underway. As part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>, &euro;8.6 billion has been indicatively allocated over the period 2018 to 2027 towards the delivery of a sustainable national public transport system. Ireland has already stopped buying diesel-only buses for the urban bus fleet and under the <i>BusConnects</i>programme, it is expected that approximately half of the public urban bus fleet in the Greater Dublin Area will be low-emitting by 2023, with full conversion by 2030. Work is also underway to move the commuter rail fleet to low-emitting alternatives. There are plans to electrify key heavily-used elements of the rail network by creating a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, and Maynooth and the M3 Parkway. The latter project, known as DART+ West, is currently open for public consultation. This project will also include interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metrolink networks.</p><p>The State&rsquo;s movement towards low-emission vehicles is important in helping to promote and normalize the use of alternative fuels and technologies, including electricity, in the transport sector. Additionally, as battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition to EVs, thereby progressively reducing the carbon footprint from the state-owned fleet and further promoting more widespread acceptance of the lower emitting alternatives.</p></reply>

This, in part, can be seen by use of the free Eircode Finder website.  There have been over 69.7 million lookups on the Finder since launch in 2015, with 2.3 million lookups in April 2020 which is a 55% increase on the previous April.  During 2019 there were over 18 million free look-ups on the Finder, an increase of 27% on the previous year. </p>  <p>  In 2017 an independent nationally representative face-to-face survey conducted by Am&aacute;rach Research showed 84% of respondents were able to supply a validated Eircode for their address. Other independent research carried out on behalf of Eircode by Am&aacute;rach Research in 2018 and 2019 showed that 96% and 99% respectively of the Irish public are aware of Eircodes.   </p>  <p>  Eircode have informed my Department that to-date there are over 1,390 business organisations and state agencies who are licensing Eircodes within their business systems and operations across a wide spectrum of sectors, including logistics/deliveries, emergency services, utilities, hotel, retail, telecommunications, Insurance, financial, food deliveries, service engineers and property management.  There are many more businesses using the free Eircode Finder in their day-to-day business operations.  </p>  <p>  Eircode has licensed 37 approved Eircode Providers who resell Eircode database and products incorporating Eircodes. Many of these Eircode Providers are Irish SME&rsquo;s and international companies developing business solutions and apps utilising Eircodes for their customers across a wide spectrum of business categories. </p>  <p>  Google have integrated Eircodes into Google Maps and other leading satnav providers such as TomTom, Garmin, HERE Navigation and Microsoft have also integrated Eircodes into their satnav apps for use by consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>  The National Ambulance Service (NAS) have integrated Eircodes into their dispatch system which means that the patient&rsquo;s address and the position of the nearest available ambulance can be accurately pinpointed, using the Eircode, on a digital map, enabling an ambulance to be quickly and accurately routed to someone in need of medical help. NAS continue to install their ambulances across the country with Digital Mobile Data Systems that allows responding crews to have the call details sent to their Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) screens together with the Eircode and visual location data in map format to assist with ambulance arrival at the correct location.

The inclusion of Eircode in the text alert from NAS to the Cardiac First Responders (CFR) greatly assists the CFR to respond directly by the fastest route and the NAS actively encourage people who are seeking an emergency ambulance to have their Eircode available to pass it on to the call taker.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Deputy might be interested to know that in October 2017 a new emergency mobile phone precise location service was launched that greatly assists the emergency services in determining the exact location of people in need that call 999 or 112.The Advanced Mobile Location (AML) is available on both Android and Apple devices and works by automatically finding a phone's GPS co-ordinates and sending them by way of a text message to the Emergency Call Answering Service when a 112 or 999 number is dialled. The co-ordinates are immediately passed to the emergency services in responding and dispatching emergency personnel to callers in need across Ireland. The NAS use AML which plots the mobile location automatically on the call takers OSI map. Approximately 55% of emergency calls from mobile devices have AML data and it is of vital assistance to Emergency Services around the country, but particularly in rural areas.   </p>  <p>  In addition since March 2018 under EU law all new models of cars sold must be equipped with eCall technology. eCall is an emergency call generated either manually by the occupants inside the car by pushing a button or automatically through activation of sensors inside the car following a crash. When activated in Ireland, the in-vehicle eCall device will establish an emergency call carrying both voice and data directly to the Emergency Call Answering Service who will transfer the call to the required emergency service. Where no voice is carried on the call, eCall technology allows for the data to be transferred directly to the National Ambulance Service. </p>  <p>  Operational matters and the use of location based services to dispatch ambulances is a matter for the NAS and not one in which I, as Minister, have a statutory function.</p></reply>

The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002), under which the CRU is assigned responsibility for calculation of the levy each year. The methodology for determining the PSO levy charge is also set out in S.I. 217 of 2002.The PSO levy has been in place since 2001, and is a charge on all electricity customers without exception. It consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national policy objectives for renewables and security of supply. The PSO levy supports the development of renewable electricity and is a key enabler to decarbonising our electricity system over the longer term in line with the Climate Action Plan and the Programme for Government. </p><p>In the coming years as we move decisively to confront the challenge of global warming and decarbonise electricity, and to promote a green recovery in the wake of Covid-19, the importance of the PSO will continue as a vital support for increasing renewable electricity which is a national policy objective for good climate and energy reasons. The Programme for Government confirms that a reliable supply of safe, secure and clean energy is essential in order to deliver a phase-out of fossil fuels and that the Government is committed to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030.  </p><p>The latest CRU decision paper for 2020/21 gives details of schemes supported for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 periods (see Table 6.2). In 2019/2020, the PSO levy was used primarily to fund renewable energy sources of electricity such as onshore wind and biomass as well as peat generation.  For the period 2020/21, the PSO Levy is used exclusively to fund renewable electricity. </p></reply>

This plan contains a range of measures to reform and strengthen waste management with a greater focus on prevention through product design and consumer choice. The measures outlined in the Waste Action Plan will ensure that we continue to meet our European targets for waste and will reflect the level of ambition in the waste and climate areas at EU level. It sets out a range of objectives and targets for the State and the measures by which to achieve them, including the introduction of a recovery levy to drive higher recycling rates, move higher up the waste hierarchy and reduce our reliance on recovery over the medium term.  </p>  <p>  While the clear ambition of the plan is to reduce the amount of waste generated, we will still require waste treatment infrastructure to manage waste which does arise. In this context, the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for granting and enforcing industrial and waste licences and undertakes an annual programme of audits and inspections of EPA-licensed facilities. It is, therefore, not appropriate for me to comment or interfere in any way in a licence application, the determination of which is a statutory function of the EPA under Part IV of the EPA Act 1992.</p></reply>

The Government Statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy published in 2018 recognised that a plan-led approach is needed to develop a range of measures to promote regional options for data centre investment, minimising the need for additional grid infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  While data centres have until recently accounted for less than 2% of Ireland&rsquo;s total electricity demand, EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029.  Significant increases in volumes of generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s electrification objectives and demand from heat pumps, electric vehicles and data centres. The Climate Action Plan sets out a number of actions to ensure that data centres are accommodated in a sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  All large energy users, including data centres, are subject to the same charging rules. These rules are determined by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) Ireland&rsquo;s independent energy regulator.  In July Eirgrid published an updated Data Centre Connection Offer Process and Policy. It is also currently undertaking a &ldquo;Vision 2030&rdquo; study across the three dimensions of electricity networks, power system operation, and electricity markets with the aim of developing an integrated all-island vision of the 2030 power system and electricity market. </p>  <p>  Corporate power purchasing of renewable energy by large energy users that is unsubsidised by the state will also be critical to supplying data centre demand, as will ensuring that large demand connections are regionally balanced to minimise grid reinforcements and the costs to consumers. The Climate Action Plan includes a target for 2030 to meet 15% of electricity demand by renewable sources contracted under corporate power purchase agreements, with the data centre sector, the first to execute these in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan also provides that the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) will use its new strategy for 2020 to 2024 to fully integrate decarbonisation objectives across its portfolio of clients and other relevant stakeholders. Building on the 2018 Government Policy Statement, the new IDA Strategy will seek to ensure new large-scale enterprise investments in Ireland, including factors such as location and power purchase agreement opportunities, are aligned with the build-out of the grid to maximise renewable sources.</p></reply>

The development of this indigenous, clean and sustainable resource will contribute towards the achievement of our 2030 and 2050 climate goals, while also establishing a valuable export market and tangible benefits to local marine users, neighbouring coastal communities and Irish companies.  </p>  <p>  Realising the potential of our offshore resources requires significant work to  develop the legal, regulatory and economic regime. The Programme for Government commits to taking the steps to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030 by inter alia,:</p>  <p>- Holding the first Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) auction by the end of 2020, with auctions held each year thereafter, including the first RESS auction for offshore wind in 2021;</p>  <p>- Giving cross-government priority to the drafting of the Marine Planning and Development Bill, so that it is published as soon as possible and enacted within nine months.</p>  <p>- Producing a whole-of-government plan setting out how we will deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and how we will develop the necessary skills base, supply chains, legislation, and infrastructure to enable it.</p>  <p>  Good progress is already being made on these commitments and my Department is engaged with other Departments and agencies regarding the potential of Ireland&rsquo;s supply chain in this area. The development of our offshore wind sector presents significant opportunities to Irish businesses, communities and the economy as a whole. The Programme for Government 2030 targets entail total investment of tens of billions of euro and thousands of long-term, high-value jobs in manufacturing, installation and maintenance of wind farm assets and associated infrastructure and services. With appropriate supports, Irish firms could capture a significant proportion of this overall investment which is planned to grow still further beyond 2030 with the large-scale deployment floating wind technology. Regional ports are already experiencing inward investment in anticipation of the significant upgrading works required for turbine assembly and deployment. Smaller ports will also see the creation of long-term jobs, as these ports are often more closely located to the wind farm sites themselves, and will be required for ongoing operation and maintenance.</p></reply>

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore it is illegal to use them on public roads and in public places. Any person using one in public may be prosecuted and have their vehicle confiscated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.</p>  <p>  Changes to the legal status of these vehicles are not as simple as declaring them no longer mechanically propelled vehicles. Any changes to this require primary legislation which, as the Deputy will appreciate, may take some time.</p>  <p>  I intend to legislate for eScooters in accordance with the Programme for Government. This will involve identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. The Government's current legislative priorities are the necessary measures to manage the Covid 19 crisis and to address its social and economic consequences. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a timeframe for e-scooter legislation at this time, although the situation will be kept under review.</p></reply>

The Government has committed to increasing participation at all ages, and there is clear evidence that active children are more likely to continue participating in sport and physical activity throughout their lives than those who are sedentary. The public health restrictions necessary to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic have placed a considerable strain on children and young people. The return of sports training, competition and summer camps have been a very positive development for our children's wellbeing and I hope it will be possible for sporting activity to continue during the winter months.</p>  <p>  As the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, Sport Ireland has issued guidance to the sport sector on the practical implications for sport of the most recent restrictions announced on 18 August. The HSE&rsquo;s Health Surveillance and Protection Centre has published advice for children and adolescents on how to return to sport safely.</p>  <p>  I would like to recognise also the key role played by the National Governing Bodies of sport and Local Sports Partnerships to facilitate a safe return to sport for children and adults alike.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Following the Government announcement of the July Jobs Stimulus Plan eligible local authorities funded under the Department&rsquo;s regional and local road maintenance and renewal grant programmes were invited to apply for funding under the Active Travel and Climate Change Adaptation measures allocations. Council's were requested to submit a prioritised list of clearly identified proposed schemes which could be completed in 2020.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council submitted applications which amounted to over &euro;5 million for Active Travel and &euro;1.63 million for Climate Change Adaptation measures. On the 31st August the Council received notification that works to the same value of the submitted applications had been approved.</p>  <p>  As the cut-off date for submitting applications to the Department was the 14th August some, but not all, of the recent damage to roads and bridges caused by severe weather in County Cork is provided for in the August allocation.  All stimulus funding available to my Department has now been allocated. As stimulus measures are projects which are designed to be delivered this year, it is not possible for allocations to roll over into 2021.  </p>  <p>  My Department understands that Cork County Council will be seeking additional funding to assist with repair works and is in the process of finalising its submission to the Department. When the Department receives an estimate of the cost of the additional repair works, the Department  will liaise with the Council to see how a programme of repair works can be managed and funded.  As regards works which can be undertaken this year, it would be open to Cork County Council to revise its planned work programme to prioritise repairs caused by flooding.  </p>  <p>  In relation to works which will run into 2021, my Department&rsquo;s ability to provide specific funding for the repair and rehabilitation of roads in West Cork following the recent flood events is dependent on the funding made available for roads as part of the overall Estimates process.  I will be liaising with my Government colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on this. </p>  <p>  As regards national roads in West Cork, as Minister for Climate, Energy, Communications and Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and securing exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  In this context, TII is best placed to advise you regarding the repair of national roads in West Cork.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's questions to TII for a direct reply.  I ask him to advise my private office if he does not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Guidance on the safe use of face coverings is available on the gov.ie website.  Under existing regulatory provisions for the SPSV sector, drivers already have the right to refuse carriage to a passenger who does not comply with a "reasonable request" which, in the present circumstances, would include a request to wear a face covering. </p>  <p>  On 13 July the wearing of face coverings on all mass transit forms of public transport was made mandatory. On 10 August the Government decided to make mandatory provision for wearing face coverings in retail settings too. The Department of Transport is at present working with the Department of Health, in consultation with the National Transport Authority (NTA), about extending the mandatory approach to include the SPSV sector. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, compliance by passengers with the public health advice in relation to face coverings is being carefully monitored and, given the current situation and the public health advice, all drivers and passengers are strongly encouraged  to wear a face covering while in an SPSV. In addition to face covering, vehicle cleaning is also important, and guidance on this has been available to the SPSV industry and on the NTA website for the last number of months.</p></reply>

Under the 1955 Act, ship registration duties are carried out by Registrars of Ships who are officers of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Act provides a legislative basis for the establishment and regulation of a modern and comprehensive ship registration system that will be more efficient and user friendly for ship owners.  The Act provides an enabling framework for new ship registration regulations and facilitates the introduction of a new centralised, electronic and accessible Irish Register of Ships, consisting of different Parts, for the registration of different types of ships and for different registration purposes.  It also provides for the extension of mandatory registration to additional ship categories. </p>  <p>  Full commencement of the 2014 Act requires the establishment of the new electronic Irish Register of Ships and registration regime, which will be progressed under a separate IT project, and the preparation of new ship registration regulations to complement and align with the Register IT project.  At this point I am not in a position to be precise about the timeframe for commencement given the need to develop the new electronic Register and associated regulations, and then to transfer ship registration information and functions from the Revenue Commissioners to the new Register and my Department.  The current ship registration arrangements under the 1955 Act will therefore continue for some time yet.</p></reply>

The EVTI Scheme was established to encourage private and commercial car or van users who regularly use tolled roads to consider switching to an electric alternative. It was estimated that there were approximately 400,000 heavy toll users in Ireland and so a reduced tolling incentive would act as a meaningful inducement for a large number of vehicle owners.</p>  <p>  Following recommendations from Phase 2 of the LEV Taskforce, which focused on alternative fuels other than electricity, my Department received funding in Budget 2020 to expand the Scheme to include toll reductions for electric motorbikes, hydrogen fuelled passenger cars and small public service vehicles, and heavy duty vehicles (trucks, buses and coaches) fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen or electricity.  In line with Government policy, conventional hybrid vehicles are not included in this Scheme. </p>  <p>  Under the LEVTI Scheme, which is administered by Transport Infrastructure Ireland on behalf of my Department, full battery electric, hydrogen, CNG and LNG vehicles qualify for a 50% toll reduction and plug-in hybrid vehicles qualify for a 25% toll reduction, up to a maximum annual threshold of &euro;500 for private vehicles and &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles including SPSVs. Greater off-peak reductions apply to the M50 toll and the Dublin Port Tunnel.</p>  <p>  As of the end of July 2020, almost 12,000 vehicles have registered under the LEVTI Scheme. The uptake rate is considered high in light of the fact that many of the toll roads in Ireland are located in the South and East of the country while alternatively fuelled vehicle ownership has a wider geographic distribution. To date, registered vehicles have completed almost 1 million transactions under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  In terms of funding, &euro;1.5 million was allocated to this Scheme in 2020. Due to the significant decline in road traffic this year because of COVID-19, fewer discounted journeys have been made by registered users and it is therefore unlikely that the entire budgeted allocation will be spent. It is my intention to continue the expanded LEVTI Scheme into 2021, and the level of funding allocated will be determined in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

In practical terms, motorists who use my Departments online service at www.motortax.ie  to pay motor tax receive their tax reminder notice through electronic means, rather than a posted notice, thereby completing the overall transaction electronically. Customers who wish to remain with the paper based system can still do so, and continue to tax through the post or by personal appearance at motor tax offices. </p>  <p>  Departments in line with eGovernment objectives are required to identify opportunities which will optimise online service availability for customers and at the same time deliver efficiencies to the Exchequer. Traditionally approx 4.5m motortax reminder notices were issued by post, at significant cost to the State. By fully integrating this process with those vehicles that are taxed online,  all such notices now issue by email.  </p>  <p>  Moreover,  the mandatory introduction of the EU Payments Services Directive 2 (PSD2) will require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) to be used for all electronic transactions. The Directive will have implications for how service providers handle online transactions. The requirement ensures that electronic payments are performed with multi-factor authentication, to increase the security of electronic payments. This requires all online service providers to capture additional transaction information (including e-mail address) and send to the cardholder&rsquo;s bank. The cardholder&rsquo;s banks will use this data to verify the cardholder. The aim of the Directive is to reduce online fraud and increase cardholder confidence in using online services. The use of the email entered on the site, in conjunction with other transaction data, will help in making the transaction processes as seamless as possible, and remove or reduce any extra layer of friction at the payment stage.</p>  <p>  On a broader level, the COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted the need for digital government services and the demand on existing services. In this regard, the electronic solution has supported the collection of motor tax, enabled existing services to function as normal, and reduced the need for motor tax renewal forms to be printed and issued manually from our offices.</p>  <p>  My Department have no plans at this time to review the requirement of an email address when taxing online. </p></reply>

This is intended to cover the appraisal of projects for future development, if possible.   </p>  <p>  All proposed projects must now comply with the revised Public Spending Code published in December 2019. An important change to the Public Spending Code is the introduction of a requirement for a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.  The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Strategic Assessment Report is to examine the rationale for a proposed project and to ensure the strategic alignment of projects with Government policy, including the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan. The SAR is also an important step in the project lifecycle in that potential alternatives for an intervention are assessed and identified for further appraisal should the project progress to the Preliminary Business Case phase of the appraisal process. Once completed, a SAR needs approval from both the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure.</p>  <p>  As regards the R624 Fota Road, there was some initial engagement between Cork County Council and my Department last year, including a meeting with the Department&rsquo;s Strategic Research and Analysis Division regarding the project appraisal process. My Department understands that Cork County Council is now proposing to appoint consultants to carry out a transport study which will look at all options in relation to  access to Cobh and Great Island. </p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.  </p>  <p>  The legislation governing the HTB scheme is set out in section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended.  In addition to requiring that the new property is occupied as the sole or main residence of a first time purchaser, the legislation also defines a &lsquo;qualifying residence&rsquo; for the purposes of the scheme.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling. Thus, for a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a home not having been previously been used as a home. Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for the HTB incentive. </p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The Help to Buy (HTB) scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. If HTB were also available for second-hand properties, it would limit the incentive effect on the provision of additional supply. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to extend HTB to second-hand properties.</p></reply>

The objective of the EWSS is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible, as well as enabling employers scale back up their business.</p>  <p>  The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  A sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer.  As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is a significant economy wide support for employers, but it is not the only measure that the Government have put in place to support businesses at this time, including those that are specifically targeted at sole-traders, such as the income tax loss relief measure that was announced in July as part of the Stimulus Package.  This new once-off income tax relief is targeted at self-employed individuals carrying on a trade or profession who were profitable in 2019 but, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, incur losses in 2020. The measure allows such individuals to claim to have those losses (and certain unused capital allowances) carried back and deducted from their profits for the tax year 2019 providing a cash-flow boost of up to &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000 as applicable.</p>  <p>  Further, there are a range of other business support measures available, such as Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  As regards the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the position with respect to individuals&rsquo; entitlements to supplementary welfare payments is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that it is currently conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers who availed of the scheme in order to confirm that they met the eligibility criteria and, crucially, that their employees received the correct amount of subsidy due to them.  As part of this programme, in order to ensure that employees were fairly treated and that TWSS funds were passed on to employees as intended, Revenue is seeking a sample of payslips from each employer. Under the TWSS legislation, employers were legally obliged to include the amount of subsidy paid on each employee&rsquo;s payslips. </p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that where an employer has been paid a temporary wage subsidy in respect of an employee and it transpires that the employer has not passed on the wage subsidy to the employee, or that the employer was not entitled to receive the wage subsidy in respect of the employee, the relevant law requires that the employer must refund the wage subsidy amount to Revenue.</p>  <p>  The TWSS has now been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) since 1 September as legislated for under the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  </p>  <p>  The specific nature and terms of the EWSS arrangement are separate and distinct from the TWSS: the EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support that gives a flat rate subsidy to qualifying employers.  The scheme is not an income support for employees, but is a stand-alone measure to preserve the link between employee and employer and support firm viability through an unprecedented enterprise environment and it is based on clear, objective criteria that may be determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  </p>  <p>  The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;1,462 gross wages per week, the level of subsidy paid to the employer is &euro;203.  For every qualifying employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50.  No subsidy is payable in respect of employees paid less than &euro;151.50 gross or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.</p>  <p>  The question of an individual employee&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters that are outside the remit of the EWSS.  The scheme has no role in relation to the employer/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned, subject, of course, to the employer paying the minimum amount of gross wages to an employee, as outlined above, in order to qualify for subsidy.   </p>  <p>  Anything beyond that would be expressly outside of the remit of the Revenue Commissioners, but there are a sufficient number of bodies that deal with employment disputes in Ireland and where there is a high amount of expertise including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Although these bodies fall under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, it is understood that there are already checks and balances in place to ensure fairness to employees and employers.</p>  <p>  In terms of employer eligibility, the EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the EWSS must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances.  Following such review, if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer will meet the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, namely, at least a 30 per cent reduction in business turnover or customer orders in the period from 1 July to 31 December 2020 by reference to the corresponding 2019 period, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>  Finally, the administration of the EWSS will be placed under the care and management of Revenue, as was done with its predecessor, the TWSS. While Revenue&rsquo;s focus on the EWSS in its early stages will no doubt be concentrated on getting the scheme up and running and ensuring that all employers who are eligible for subsidy payments receive the payments in a timely manner, I have no doubt but that Revenue will, in due course, undertake an appropriate employer compliance campaign relating to employer eligibility under the EWSS.</p></reply>

These statistics are available at: . </p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, replacing the TWSS from 1 September 2020 until March 2021.  It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. </p><p>As of 10 September, over 32,200 employers have registered for the Scheme which is a healthy level of applications and already nearly half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the duration of that scheme.  As employers continue to register for the EWSS and file payroll with Revenue for the relevant employees, the numbers of employees that will be supported by the scheme will be made available and the implications of the movement from TWSS to EWSS will be assessed.  Revenue has confirmed that it has started to include information on the EWSS in their statistics, also located at the above link.

A further &euro;2.25 billion has been allocated to the EWSS until the end of March 2021 and the Deputies&rsquo; attention is also drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan, such as the Re-Start Grants and Credit Guarantee scheme. </p><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments where I determine that these are necessary. </p></reply>

It focused on reductions to income tax targeted at low to middle income earners. The lower rates of Universal Social Charge were reduced from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2% and 4.5%, respectively. The income tax standard-rate band was increased by &euro;2,500 from &euro;32,800 to &euro;35,300 for single individuals and from &euro;41,800 to &euro;44,300 for married one earner couples, and the higher rate of income tax was reduced from 41% to 40%. By making these changes, the Government made steady and sustainable progress in reducing the income tax burden for low and middle income earners by concentrating on increasing the level that workers pay the marginal rate of income tax.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a number of specific undertakings with regard to personal taxation, including:</p>  <p>  - There will be no increases in income tax or USC rates.</p>  <p>  - In Budget 2021, there will be no change to income tax credits or bands. From Budget 2022 onwards, in the event that incomes are again rising as the economy recovers, credits and bands will be indexed linked to earnings. This will be done to prevent an increase in the real burden of income tax, to prevent more low-income workers being taken into the tax net because of no changes to the tax system and to ensure there is no increase in the number of people having to pay higher income tax and USC rates.</p>  <p>  The extent to which it may be possible to make progress in this regard will depend on prevailing economic circumstances.  </p>  <p>  During the current crisis, the Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that assistance is given to employees and businesses in a sustainable and affordable manner. Even though many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased, economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020 because of the continued need to observe some requirements such as social distancing.  </p></reply>

It will remain in place until March 2021, thereby allowing employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.</p>  <p>  As set out in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, payment of the EWSS will be made following receipt of the regular monthly payroll return to Revenue which is due on the 14th of the month following payment of the emoluments.  The transfer of the subsidy will, in general, be made within two working days after receipt of the monthly payroll submission.  Depending on the pay-date used by the employer, this may be as short a turnaround as 16 days, although it could be up to 6 weeks after the pay date in some cases. </p>  <p>  The up-to-date position is that having regard to the timeline for employers to make claims to Revenue for support under EWSS, which aligns with the normal operation of the PAYE system, it is likely to be closer to the end of this month or early next month before we are in a position to get a fuller picture of the operation of the payment system and to evaluate its efficacy. </p>  <p>  The main purpose behind the adaption from the TWSS is to reduce the administrative burden of the scheme for employers by regularising the procedure for the processing of payments, and thereby reduce errors and the need for reconciliations which have had to take place under the TWSS.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that the turnaround time for payments under the TWSS in some cases was shorter, but this is one of a number of changes in the nature and operation of the EWSS, many of which are more flexible than the TWSS &ndash; for example, the types of worker who qualify has been broadened to include seasonal workers and new hires.  </p>  <p>  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.  At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy. </p>  <p>  For these businesses who need further support, or who experience cash-flow difficulties arising for the timing of the subsidy payments, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including  the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. </p></reply>

As such, I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders.  However, neither I, nor the Central Bank can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19, nor can we adjudicate on the validity of such claims.</p>  <p>  That being said, this is an issue that Minister of State Fleming and I continue to follow closely.  Whether a business can make a claim in relation to COVID-19 related loss of earnings will depend on the specifics of their policy. In cases where there is infectious disease cover, there may be other considerations which will influence the decision of an insurer to not pay a claim. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, it is important therefore for businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker on these matters, and where they believe an insurer has incorrectly rejected their claim, they should either consider referring the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSPO) for adjudication or where their claim is in excess of the FSPO &euro;3 million limit they may wish to consider legal action. I understand that this is already happening in a number of cases.</p>  <p>  Both my Department and I have had considerable engagement with the insurance industry on the issue of business interruption claims over the past number of months. From the outset I have made it very clear that as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  They should engage with those impacted businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. Furthermore, I have made it clear that the Government direction to close a business in the context of COVID 19 should be considered as such where a claim may be appropriate.  I have also indicated to the insurance industry that adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, is doing the industry significant reputational damage and is not treating customers fairly. Most recently when Minister Fleming and I met with Insurance Ireland to discuss the Programme for Government&rsquo;s ambitious insurance reform agenda, I continued to stress the need for an appropriate response from insurers.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework sets out it&rsquo;s expectations of insurance firms in handling COVID-19 related business interruption insurance claims. Where customers have an entitlement to claim under a business interruption insurance policy, the Bank expects that claims will be processed and paid promptly and fully. Significantly, where cover and related issues are disputed, the Bank expects firms to pay the reasonable costs of customer plaintiffs in agreed test case litigation.  I welcome this move and I am aware that a number of test cases are due to be heard in the courts next month.  The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to monitor the business interruption issue and will engage appropriately with the Central Bank on the matter. This issue is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building on the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.</p></reply>

The average monthly cost of the TWSS was around &euro;500m which would be the expected cost per month if the measure was to be retained beyond the end date of 31 August.</p><p>The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, replacing the TWSS from 1 September 2020 until March 2021. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. The EWSS is an economy wide scheme and it cannot be tailored to meet individual sectors&rsquo; needs. For businesses experiencing financial difficulties, there are a number of options open to them apart from the EWSS, including State backed loans and grants. Measures include the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p><p>It is expected that the EWSS will support around 350,000 jobs into the beginning of 2021.  On this basis, it is estimated that the EWSS will cost &euro;2.25 billion (&euro;1.35 billion in 2020 inclusive of seasonal workers and &euro;0.9 billion in 2021).  The scheme is demand led and a significant surge in claims may require a policy review and re-evaluation of the terms of the scheme.  These cost predictions are therefore subject to review and for every additional 50,000 qualifying employments, the cost increases by &euro;0.25 billion.  </p><p>The tentative costs per month between EWSS and TWSS are set out in the table below but it is emphasised that the cost of the EWSS is a projection and subject to review.  Further, in both cases, the costs are on the basis of the schemes as implemented in their totality and individual elements of the scheme (such as the rates and qualifying criteria) have not been disaggregated.  It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the cost of applying TWSS rates of payment to the EWSS as currently configured. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>EWSS</th>       <th>TWSS</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Cost</td>       <td>&euro;2.25 billion (8 months)</td>       <td>&euro;2.8 billion (6 months)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monthly Cost</td>       <td>~&euro;300 million</td>       <td>~&euro;500 million</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Although many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020 because of the continued need to observe some requirements such as social distancing.  The Government is therefore committed to a wage subsidy scheme to maintain the link between the employee and employer insofar as is possible into 2021. The position in relation to the EWSS, as with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay, sick pay or pension schemes.</p><p>I am satisfied that the EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.  The level of subsidy being granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which had been reducing since the start of June and since 14 August was &euro;283 across all recipients and &euro;219 in the case of first-time recipients.</p></reply>

Accordingly, this is one of the reasons the Government has been prioritising investment in flood defences over in recent years.</p>  <p>  However, you should be aware that the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I in my role as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to remind the Deputy that current government policy in relation to increasing flood insurance coverage is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to managing flooding problems. To achieve this aim there is a focus on:</p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,  </p>  <p>  - implementation of flood relief management plans by the OPW to deliver flood relief schemes, and   </p>  <p>  - maintaining channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in affected areas.</p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and industry representatives Insurance Ireland. This provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes, which should in-turn provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed. In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that while there has been an overall increase in the provision of flood insurance between 2015 and 2019, many householders are still experiencing difficulties. This is particularly the case for households living in areas with demountable flood defences.</p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the challenges of property insurance and flooding and indeed this is one of the actions assigned to the Department of Finance under the Climate Action Plan. Over the last year my Department launched a public consultation on Climate Change and Insurance and subsequently met with interested parties. The key themes that arose from the consultation related to (i) the lack of data on flood insurance coverage and (ii) the challenges of obtaining flood cover in areas with demountable defences. My Department is now meeting with key stakeholders such as the Central Bank, the OPW, Irish Public Bodies and the State Claims Agency to further review the issues raised and assess a feasible way forward. This review is in progress and my Department will continue to provide updates on this workstream to the Climate Action Delivery Board.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to be active on insurance issues including flooding, and we are proactively engaging on all aspects of insurance reform. This is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things, seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building upon the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  </p></reply>

The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple. </p>  <p>  The scheme is a tax-based measure administered by Revenue and is one of a number of initiatives introduced by the Government as part of the July Stimulus Package with the aim of supporting employment.</p>  <p>  With regard to the details supplied by the Deputy, it should be noted that, while the normal position is that a tax credit can only benefit a person who has an income tax liability, special arrangements have been made to extend the potential benefit of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit as widely as possible so that, even where a person does not have an income tax liability, he or she may still benefit by virtue of having a USC liability. </p>  <p>  In terms of those on lower incomes, the position is that a full-time minimum wage worker will be able to absorb fully the Stay and Spend Tax Credit in either 2020 or 2021.  Indeed a person who earns 75% of the minimum wage in the year, for example a person working part-time for just over 29 hours per week on the minimum wage, will also be able to fully absorb the credit in either 2020 or 2021. In this case, the person will not have an income tax liability, but, by virtue of the fact that the tax credit may be set against a USC liability, the person will be able to fully benefit.</p>  <p>  The credit will be off-set against the claimant&rsquo;s income tax liability in the year of assessment, after other allowances, deductions or reliefs have been given to the claimant. If the credit available to a claimant is higher than their income tax liability in the year of assessment, any excess credit may be off-set against their liability to USC in that same year. This credit can be used to reduce a claimant&rsquo;s liability to income tax and USC in the year of assessment to nil.</p></reply>

Along with the filing of their annual corporation tax return, a qualifying company is required to file their annual financial statements with Revenue. </p><p>In addition to the Revenue reporting requirements, under section 18 of the Central Bank Act 1971, all qualifying companies are obliged to report quarterly data to the Central Bank.

The European Central Bank statistics provide harmonised information on the securitisation market and can also be broken down by country. The country by country list can be accessed at the following link: .</p><p>There is no legislative requirement contained in the Tax Acts which requires a company to state in their financial statements that they are a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 TCA 1997. However, where the qualifying company is an Irish registered company, it must prepare financial statements in accordance with the Companies Act 2014, which must give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the company.  This is generally taken to be the case where the financial statements are prepared under Irish or International accounting standards.  Both such accounting standards require that a note to the financial statements explains the tax charge in the accounts.  In addition, the Companies Act 2014, at paragraph 64 of Part IV of Schedule 3, requires that the financial statements of larger companies include certain particulars on the tax charge in the accounts. Given the material impact of being a qualifying company on the tax charge of the company, the tax note generally explicitly states that the company&rsquo;s current tax is calculated in accordance with section 110 TCA 1997.</p></reply>

These measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements, and included a loan payment break of up to three months which was subsequently extended for up to a six month period.</p>  <p>  The financial circumstances of many of the borrowers which availed of a Covid-19 payment break have now normalised and they are in a position to return to making payments.  In that regard, the BPFI has indicated that the broad options available to borrowers coming off a payment break will be to return to payments over the existing term of the loan, or to extend the term of the loan so as to make the monthly repayments more affordable for the borrower.  It is important that lenders and borrowers coming off a payment break will engage so as to select the most appropriate new repayment arrangement in their individual case.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, at the end of a payment beak there will be some borrowers who will continue to experience financial difficulty.  In these circumstances, it will be particularly important that engagement should take place as early as possible.  I would, therefore, encourage any borrower who feels he or she may have difficulty in resuming payments after a Covid-19 payment break to contact their lender and if possible to do so before the payment break end date.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations, under the Central Bank consumer protection framework, to support and work with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. In particular, lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate and sustainable solution having regard to the particular circumstances of a case and that lenders should use the full suite of restructuring solutions available to them.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, and the industry to seek to ensure that banks continue to work with and pro-actively assist their customers who will still be experiencing difficulty at the end of a Covid-19 payment break and to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

The legislation to give effect to this increase has been outlined in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020 and was signed into law on 1 August 2020. </p><p>In summary, the legislation provides that where applicants</p><p>(I) enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or apartment, or</p><p>(ii) make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build property, </p><p>during the period from 23 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, they will be eligible for increased relief under the HTB scheme to the lesser of:</p><p>- &euro;30,000 (increased from &euro;20,000),</p><p>- 10 per cent (increased from 5 per cent) of either the purchase price of the new home or, in the case of self builds, the completion value of the property, or,</p><p>- the amount of Income Tax and DIRT paid in the four years prior to making the application.</p><p>All other conditions of the original HTB scheme remains the same. </p><p>The purpose of HTB is two-fold, firstly to assist first-time buyers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new home and secondly to stimulate the growth in supply of new homes. In assisting young people to take their first steps into home-ownership, the scheme supports a fundamental social policy objective.  </p><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the advice that I received from my officials in preparing the enhanced HTB measure for the Stimulus package.  Such advice related to the intent of the enhancement, its operation and its impact for first-time buyers and its estimated cost.</p><p>It is not possible to provide a reliable cost estimate of any deadweight element that might arise in connection with the enhanced scheme.  This is because the circumstances of potential beneficiaries are unknown. However, I would draw the Deputy's attention to a key feature of the scheme which is designed to minimise any deadweight effect, i.e. the minimum loan to value of 70% in order for purchases to be eligible for HTB - that requirement has not changed.  In addition, as the as the Deputy may be aware, in 2018 I commissioned an independent Cost benefit Analysis (CBA) of the Help to Buy incentive. The report of the CBA was published on the day of Budget 2019. The analysis found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28. indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive.  </p><p>The Report can be found at the following link.</p><p>www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2019/Documents/Tax%20Expenditures%20Report%20Budget%202019.pdf</p></reply>

This does not include the cost of removing Stamp Duty on other payment cards, which would increase this cost by a further &euro;17 million. </p>  <p>  The &euro;30 stamp duty on credit cards is generally collected by the card issuing financial institutions on 1 April each year for the preceding year, i.e. one year in arrears. The tax year for this stamp duty normally begins on 2 April each year. </p>  <p>  As part of a package of measures I introduced in response to the early phase of the Covid 19 pandemic, I determined that for 2020, the stamp duty on credit cards, which is normally charged to accounts on 1 April each year, would not be collected until 1 July. It is however anticipated that the collection dates will revert to normal in 2021. The stamp duty collected on 1 July 2020 was in respect of the period 2 April 2019 to 1 April 2020.  I did this to help mitigate the sudden and significant reduction in income that was being experienced by many at the time.  </p>  <p>  I am not aware of any evidence that the &euro;30 annual stamp duty acts as a significant disincentive to the use or issuance of credit cards, particularly as it is not usage based, but is rather a flat charge that is levied each year, irrespective of whether a credit card is used or not in the 12 month period. I have no plans at this time to remove or amend that stamp duty.</p></reply>

Indeed, it has made it clear to all lenders (including banks, local authorities and other credit information providers) that either a full or partial payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 is not, in itself, an event that is reportable to the Central Credit Register. Furthermore, the Bank has also clarified that a payment break agreed between a lender and a borrower as a response to Covid-19 should not be reported to the Central Credit Register as either a &ldquo;missed payment&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;restructure event&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature (and in turn it is based on information provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders).  It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit.  Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers may access their credit report free of charge (subject to fair usage) at www.centralcreditregister.ie.    </p>  <p>  Separately, borrowers may also wish to check with their lenders to see if they submit information on loans to any private credit bureaux which  may produce credit ratings or credit scores. However, it should be noted that, unlike the Central Credit Register, private credit bureaux do not fall within the remit of the Central Bank. </p></reply>

Specifically, the pricing and availability of non-life insurance has been subject to considerable volatility. Accordingly, reform of this sector has been, and remains a key priority of Government as is recognised in a considerable number of Programme for Government commitments.  </p>  <p>  However, the provision of insurance is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. Consequently, neither I in my role as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).</p>  <p>  In the first instance if a consumer has a complaint with the service of their insurance provider, it is advisable that that they pursue this through the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if, after 40 days, the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the consumer may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  This provides an independent arbitration of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  In order to be helpful to the Deputy, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland on this matter who responded that they do not track data on pricing of classes of vehicles (such as electric vehicles) as pricing is a matter for each individual company to assess relative to their particular commercial strategy, risk appetite and claims experience.  They indicated many of the major underwriters have specific products designed for electric vehicles, with bespoke features such as battery breakdown assistance. Insurance Ireland also noted that there are a number of specialist intermediaries entering into the electric vehicle market.  They indicated that the specific issue outlined in the question is not one which has been raised by consumers to them through their Insurance Information Service.  This Service is for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I believe the issue raised in the question demonstrates why it is important for consumers, including businesses, to shop around on their insurance policies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. I believe that this advice applies to businesses as well as individuals. The CCPC website also includes a motor insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting motor insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures, or the continuation of  measures which are due to terminate, should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p></reply>

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  </p>  <p>  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. </p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. </p>  <p>  To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.</p>  <p>  All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is a legal obligation, referred to as the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, and it originates in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are members of the Expert Advisory group and the Public Sector Duty is reflected in all Equality Budgeting policies as appropriate. </p>  <p>  In 2019 my Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced. This work is being informed also by the views of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and work is well underway on the various recommendations in the OECD report. </p>  <p>  One example is recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting. Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO have conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and a report will be published in the coming weeks. Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. </p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government, the Government has also set out its commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring; use these well-being indicators, as well as economic indicators, to highlight inequalities and ensure that policies are driven by a desire to do better by people; and ensure that the well-being framework will be utilised in a systematic way across government policymaking (at local and national levels) in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting progress (as an important complement to existing economic measurement tools).</p>  <p>  The introduction of wellbeing budgeting will also bring a framework, which will inform equality budgeting development to areas of most need, and link departmental action to national and international equality goals, in line with OECD recommendation 1.  </p>  <p>  At present, officials in my Department are developing the programme of work that will support the Government in meeting this commitment with regard to well-being.  This work programme will be progressed on a cross-Governmental basis in liaison with the Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance and other government departments as well as key stakeholders and experts in this area. </p>  <p>  Once developed, the Government will promote the use of a well-being framework in a systematic way across the spectrum of public policy-making in Ireland, including in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting on progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.</p>  <p>  One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policy making across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.</p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, deliver on the OECD recommendations step-by-step, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle.</p></reply>

It is expected that all State bodies abide by this guidance, or should explain reasons for any deviation. However, it should be noted that the issue of term limits may also be addressed in any legislation setting up or governing State bodies. The Code provides that &ldquo;Existing legislative provisions applying to a State body on matters that are also the subject of this Code, continue to apply and for the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, the legislative provisions prevail&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently provided for some amendments to the Code, which inter alia deal with the issue of Board term membership, and which are designed to advance the Government's priority of promoting gender balance, diversity and inclusion in State bodies. The relevant provision, as now updated, sets out that:-</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Consistent with best corporate governance practice it is recommended that no member of a State Board should serve more than two full terms of appointment on that Board, or should hold appointments to more than two State Boards, at the same time, unless the specific statutory provisions relating to the particular State body enable such service. The State Board or, where necessary, the relevant Government Department should vary the terms of Board appointments to between three and five years. A period of appointment may be renewed for a further period, to a maximum of eight years in total.  If exceptionally it is decided that a Board member should serve a further additional Board term, or that a renewal of appointment would bring the total period of service to above eight years, this requires Ministerial approval. All of the above provisions are however subject to compliance with the Body&rsquo;s establishing legislation, where relevant.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In respect of the role of Chief Executive, my Department has published separate guidance on this issue (the "Guidelines for Appointments of CEOs of Non-Commercial State Bodies" of April 2019 refer). Those guidelines provide as follows:-</p>  <p>  &ldquo;In general, CEOs are appointed for one five year fixed-term contract, unless otherwise provided for in the Body&rsquo;s establishing legislation.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the guidelines provide that in any instance where a Board wishes to reappoint a CEO to a further term, a business case should be submitted to the parent Department and if approval is proposed, then submitted to my Department. Similar arrangements apply in relation to Commercial State Bodies where the template contract of employment for CEOs of Commercial State Bodies provides for appointment for a single seven year fixed term contract and any proposal for reappointment or contract extension requires submission of a business case as described above. </p></reply>

Cork County Council, in partnership with the OPW, is currently finalising tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering Consultants to progress the development of this scheme and a Prior Information Notice (PIN) has been published by the Council on www.etenders.gov.ie.  The tender is due to be advertised very shortly.</p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress the Flood Relief Scheme for Bantry, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme. An Appropriate Assessment (AA) Screening Report will be carried out during the development of the scheme, pursuant to Regulation 42 of S.I. No. 477/2011 (European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011), to determine whether any effect on the integrity of European Designated (Natura 2000) sites is likely.  Subject to the outcome of this process, a full NIS may be required.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Council has appointed a contractor again this year to carry out treatment of Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS) in the scheme area.  The first round was completed in August 2020 and the second round of treatment was carried out last week.  </p>  <p>  The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period 2018-2027.

Cork County Council was already implementing measures to deal with the risk at this location with funding provided by the Office of Public Works under the Minor Flood Mitigation &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme, but the works were not completed before the flood event occurred and a partial blockage of the pipework may have taken place. When these works are completed, it is expected that the cause of this flooding will be addressed.</p>  <p>  The issue in question is separate to the flood relief scheme for the town, undertaken by Cork County Council and funded by OPW. That scheme, offering protection to over 300 properties, commenced in 2016 and is substantially complete and has been largely operational since the end of 2018. This August saw the largest flood event in the River Ilen to have occurred since the scheme was substantially completed and it is estimated that, without the scheme being in place, up to 100 properties could have been flooded.</p></reply>

The process for those living in the State and/or abroad, including those with a disability, is outlined below. </p>  <p>  Pensions declarations administered by the NSSO as follows.</p>  <p>  - Upon notification of an individual&rsquo;s intention to retire or an application for preserved benefits, the NSSO will issue a Retirement Pack which includes the Pension Declaration, via email and/or post. The Retirement Pack is also available to download online.</p>  <p>  - The details of those permitted to complete and witness the Pensions Declaration both in the State and abroad, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Pensions Declaration (Amendment) Rules, 2003, are provided in the Retirement Pack and communicated to the civil servant/former civil servant.</p>  <p>  - A guide is made available to assist the civil servant/former civil servant in completing the Retirement Pack.

In these circumstances where an application is being made for retirement benefits, the Retirement Pack, including Pension Declarations, are completed on behalf of the civil servant by the person nominated to look after their affairs.</p>  <p>  - Those in receipt of pensions abroad are also issued with a Pension Declaration form on an annual basis for return by post to the NSSO offices based in Tullamore to ascertain continued entitlement.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that here are no plans at present to change this process.  </p>  <p>  If there is a specific issue in relation to an individual case, this can be raised through the relevant HR contacts with the Department from which the individual retired or directly with the NSSO.</p></reply>

The number of full-time equivalent staff (FTE) in the Health sector has increased by over 4,500 or almost 3.8% in the first six months of the year and is reflective of the additional supports provided to the Health System due to Covid-19 in tandem with the agreed provision for the recruitment of Health staff for 2020. </p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Schools also sets out additional resourcing to support the reopening of schools. The measures in this Roadmap include:</p>  <p>  - Over 1,000 additional teachers being made available to post primary schools in the free scheme;</p>  <p>  - Enhanced Supervision Supports funding is being provided for additional supervision to support the management of physical distancing in post primary schools.</p>  <p>  - In the primary sector, to support the availability of substitute teachers, the Department is extending the current pilot supply panels on a nationwide basis for the 2020/21 school year. This will involve the additional allocation of approx. 200 teaching posts.</p>  <p>  This demonstrates the commitment to allocate funding for recruitment of staff in key areas in order to respond to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Such an approach is consistent with the goal of sustainable growth in the level of public resources and staff numbers to ensure that public services can continue to be delivered effectively and efficiently.</p></reply>

However, in direct response to Covid-19, necessary and large-scale revisions were made to capital allocations for 2020 primarily in Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Subsequently, as part of the July Stimulus, a further &euro;500 million was provided to accelerate capital works across a wide range of areas generating jobs and economic activity across all regions of the country. These measures will be reflected as appropriate within the review of the NDP.</p></reply>

Applications were invited for the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 and the closing date was in January. The Scheme focuses on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres that operate as not-for-profit organisations throughout the country and that have a clearly defined arts and culture focus.</p>  <p>  This scheme has a particular emphasis on the reduction of carbon footprints to dovetail with the Government&rsquo;s action on climate change. The Scheme builds on the success of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 which saw grants allocated to 134 organisations in 26 counties to refurbish and enhance their facilities. This funding is provided from a &euro;40m capital investment allocation for local arts and culture infrastructure contained in Project Ireland 2040 &ldquo;Investing in our Culture, Language &amp;amp; Heritage 2018-2027'. There were three schemes with</p>  <p>  - Stream A offering grants up to &euro;50,000 for small enhancement/expansion/ refurbishment projects which may involve construction works to arts and culture facilities and/or upgrading of equipment.</p>  <p>  - Stream B will offer grants from &euro;50,000 up to &euro;300,000 for larger enhancement /expansion/ refurbishment projects involving construction works to arts and culture facilities.</p>  <p>  - Stream C is a separate scheme aimed at the upgrading of visual artists&rsquo; workspaces. Applications for this Stream were managed by Visual Artists Ireland.</p>  <p>  Assessment and final decision on applications were delayed and put on hold as a result of COVID-19 with my Department opening Stream D, a further stream of funding under this overall scheme. This was specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening. </p>  <p>  In the meantime a number of applicants under Streams A&amp;B including the one to which the Deputy refers were contacted and given an opportunity to resubmit the outstanding documentation by 7 August. These are currently at assessment stage and it is hoped that announcements will be made later this year.</p></reply>

The majority of this funding has now been paid out by my Department.</p>  <p>  The stabilisation fund is being provided as a specific once-off measure with the overall objective of ensuring the ongoing viability of the sector - thereby enabling it to continue to contribute to the systematic effort being made to support the language and Gaeltacht regions in line with the overarching objectives of the Government&rsquo;s 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and the accompanying 5-Year Action Plan for the Irish Language 2018-2022.</p>  <p>  The approval of this stability initiative took account of the need to address without delay, issues around cash-flow within the summer college sector, which has significantly hampered colleges&rsquo; ability to adequately refund fees/deposits to parents.</p>  <p>  It was a condition of approval for the stabilisation initiative that colleges seeking assistance would be required to refund in full the fees/deposits paid by students, and that no support would be provided in respect of students who opted to transfer their fees/deposits to courses in 2021 or towards online courses. This was to avoid potential for deadweight supports in any assistance provided by the State.</p>  <p>  With regard to accommodation providers, the standard rate payable under the stabilisation package is up to 40% of the daily payment normally payable by my Department under Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge (SFG). For registered households, this works out at &euro;4 per student per night (i.e. 40% of &euro;10) while for residential colleges/hostels the rate is &euro;2 per student per night (i.e. 40% of &euro;5). </p>  <p>  In seeking to make this payment, my Department has taken due account of the significant investment made by householders and colleges in meeting the standards (e.g. fire safety compliance and additional sleeping space) required for recognition under the terms of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Based, not least, on the broadly positive feedback regarding the measure from relevant stakeholders within the Irish summer colleges sector,  I am satisfied that the measure is proving to be effective and I look forward to working towards the safe return of Irish summer colleges in the future, and the ongoing contribution of our Gaeltacht households and colleges to the development of the Irish language and to sustaining Gaeltacht communities.</p></reply>

The scheme will help to de-risk the costs of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by the Department. </p><p>Application Form and Guidelines for &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; may be accessed <b>.</b></p><p>Secondly, a  further support package, the Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and western and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1 million is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.</p><p>The music support schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.</p><p>Application Form and Guidelines for &ldquo;Music Stimulus Package<b>&rdquo;</b>may be accessed .</p><p>The key features of these Support Schemes include the following: </p><p>-  Support the creation of employment opportunities in the culture, creative and  music industries.</p><p>-  Address the large gap left by the absence of income from live performances.</p><p>-  Support performances/work that will commence on or before 31 December 2020.</p><p>-  Support commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector (e.g. music, entertainment and theatre).</p><p>-  Support the music professionals and aim to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>I recently announced the setting up of a taskforce under the Chair of Clare Duignan in accordance with the Programme for Government. This commits to establishing a cross departmental taskforce to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond, which in turn will inform the National Economic Plan. </p><p>Other measures announced under the Stimulus include additional funding to the Arts Council to brings its total allocation this year to &euro;105 &ndash; some 40% higher than in 2019. A key objective of this funding is to provide enhanced support for freelance artists and arts workers who have been impacted severely by COVID-19.</p><p>Wider Government measures aimed at the creative sector include liquidity and investment measures and taxation measures as well as labour market interventions.</p><p>The new Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme will benefit workers across the creative sector. Many of these organisations availed of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme which allowed them to retain workers in employment since March.</p><p>The Government is today publishing the Roadmap for Resilience and Recovery. This maps how we balance public health, economic and social aspects of living with COVID-19 in the short to medium term and try to bring some greater certainty so that society and business can plan forward. </p></reply>

The database system used for managing deer licensing is not currently a web based one and some technical challenges arose in facilitating the processing of such licenses for staff working remotely with laptops.   </p>  <p>  Several thousand licenses applications have been received to date and over two thousand have been issued thus far.  Staff are working flat out to eliminate the backlog as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that it has been suggested by individuals, hunting and farming bodies that I would extend licenses for the previous deer hunting season to allow hunters with such a license to hunt after 1 September with their previous licenses.  However, the provisions in the Wildlife Acts do not allow for the extension of deer hunting licences and licences for last season automatically expired under the law on 31 July this year.  </p>  <p>  The priority of staff now is to have licenses issued as quickly as possible.  It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to review the legislative and administrative arrangements in relation to deer licensing with a view to securing improvements for customers and I will welcome the views of stakeholders in this regard.  The main priority for now is to deal with the backlog on hand.  In addition, it is the intention to work towards the introduction of an on-line application system and some early work in this regard has taken place and I will work to see that this happens as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables."  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl. </p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is understood that interested parties in Member States including hunting interests in Ireland made submissions on the matter during a Commission consultation process.</p>  <p>  My Department held consultations with interested parties including hunting and farming interests on this matter. While Department supports the underlying thrust of the Regulations and is committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands following consultation with hunting and farming interests, it did make a case for a longer lead in time to deal with transitional challenges and in that regard submitted documentation to the REACH Committee of the European Union, the forum where the Regulation is under discussion.  </p>  <p>  The issue was most recently discussed at the REACH meeting held on 3 September.  Notwithstanding Ireland&rsquo;s reservations on the draft Regulation in relation to the lead-in time and as we are committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands, Ireland indicated at the meeting that we would support the draft Regulation which does envisage a transitional phase.  A vote was taken at the meeting on the draft Regulation and it was passed by the necessary majority by Member States with Ireland voting to support the measure.  The draft Regulation will now be sent to the Council and European Parliament for scrutiny for a period of 3 months. </p>  <p>  My Department will maintain consultation with relevant interests including hunting and farming organisations in the coming period in relation to implementation of the draft Regulation should it become law.</p></reply>

It has been detected in the Irish hare and both wild and domestic rabbit populations. RHD2 was first identified in France in 2010 and has since spread globally. It is caused by a Lago-virus and is extremely infectious. </p>  <p>  Although it bears no risk to people, its potential impacts on the rabbit and hare populations are detrimental. While its effects on the Irish hare population are largely unknown, the impact on rabbits in other countries have been widely published with significant local and regional declines seen in some areas. There have been anecdotal reports of rabbit population declines in Ireland as well, but we do not have the data to support these and rabbits are known to be vulnerable to a number of different diseases, including myxomatosis. </p>  <p>  While the rabbit is not a protected species it is an important part of wild ecosystems and a vital source of food for several protected species such as stoats, buzzards and eagles. </p>  <p>  The Irish hare is one of our native mammals and is protected under both national and EU legislation. If RHD2 was to become widespread in this species, the impacts on its conservation status could be catastrophic. </p>  <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department, with the assistance of the Veterinary Laboratory Service in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) are collaborating on a national survey to assess the level of spread of this disease around the country. The survey will examine 500-1,000 rabbits taken from hunting bags at different locations in every county of Ireland.  The rabbits sampled will be those ordinarily taken by licensed hunters in the course of their normal leisure shooting, pest control or crop protection. These rabbits will in turn be tested to see if they are either carrying the disease or if they have been exposed to this disease. Due to the nature of this project, the NPWS &amp;amp; DAFM have sought the assistance of the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC) in gathering samples from every county. </p>  <p>  The survey will provide data on the prevalence and distribution of the disease in Ireland, but will also help us to learn more about the potential for rabbits to recover and develop immunity from the disease. The results of this survey will also allow us to better understand the risk of spread of RHD2 into hares. </p>  <p>  The aim is for all samples to be collected and submitted to local Regional Veterinary Laboratories before the end of October. Lab analysis will follow and is expected to take several months. The survey results will be published as soon as they are available.</p></reply>

We are also required to monitor their populations and report to the European Commission on their conservation status. A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both species since 2009. The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in April 2019 and is available on the NPWS website ().</p><p>The latest population estimates available to my Department indicate that there are approximately 8,000-10,000 grey seals and about 5,000 harbour seals in Ireland. These animals are spread around the Irish coast with the largest populations occurring along the west coast from the Blaskets in Co. Kerry to north Mayo and Donegal. </p><p>Seals, and grey seals in particular, are wide ranging animals. The Irish animals are known to move between Scotland and north-west France. In turn, animals from the large seals populations in Scotland migrate into Irish waters to feed. There are over 100,000 grey seals in Scotland. </p><p>While seals are a protected species, my Department may issue licenses to cull individual problem seals, and affected persons can apply for such licenses. My Department has no plans to undertake a general cull of seals.  </p><p>My Department has been in contact in the last year with fisherman interests from the south-west, including Dingle, on the question of seals. Five Section 42 license applications have been received to date this year. One of these - relating to an estuary in Sligo &ndash; was approved. One was refused as it related to the shooting of seals on the Blasket Islands, a Special Area of Conservation for seals. The remaining three applications were also from the South West &ndash; two in Kerry and one in Cork and involved shooting seals including from boats. There are concerns about this approach to seal management, given the potential safety concerns arising from using high-powered rifles on moving platforms. Nonetheless, my Department is examining the potential for a pilot scheme which would test this approach and determine its efficacy in protecting fishermen&rsquo;s catches. A decision on the two remaining licences has been delayed until this pilot scheme can be advanced. Plans to initiate this scheme earlier in the year had to be postponed due to the pandemic. </p><p>My Department is also in discussion with the Marine Institute on approaches to managing seal-fishery interactions. </p></reply>

It aims to ensure that Europe&rsquo;s biodiversity will be on the path to recovery by 2030, and proposes ambitious EU actions and commitments to halt biodiversity loss in Europe and worldwide. It proposes that by 2030, the 27 Member States collectively legally protect at least 30% of the EU&rsquo;s land and marine areas, and that 10% (or one-third of the protected areas) would be strictly protected (including strict protection relating to ancient woodland and significant areas of other carbon-rich ecosystems, such as peatlands, grasslands, wetlands and seagrass meadows).    </p>  <p>  The Strategy foresees that these proposed actions in nature protection, sustainable use and restoration will bring concrete economic benefits to local communities, creating sustainable jobs and growth, and will work in tandem with the Farm to Fork strategy and the new Common Agricultural Policy. </p>  <p>  Further information is awaited from the European Commission around criteria and guidance for identification of additional protected areas, the definition of  strict protection, and the question of burden sharing across the EU27 in reaching the 30% target. </p>  <p>  Farmers and landowners are key stakeholders in this discussion and will be crucial to implementation of the Strategy.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. </p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion or to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p><p>In regard to extending the scheme to other counties, as matters currently stand, the position is that the scheme is based on the information that was available to the Board at the time of its adoption in February 2014 and having regard to the detail set out in the Report of the Pyrite Panel (July 2012).  </p><p>The Panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with a stakeholder consultation, to establish certain facts in relation to the potential exposure of pyrite in dwellings.  The information was gathered from a number of sources including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of homeowners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives and was cross referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p><p>Seventy four estates were identified to the Pyrite Panel, as possibly having pyrite.  At that time all of these estates were located in the five local authority areas of Dublin City, Fingal, Kildare, Meath and Offaly, although the scheme was subsequently amended in February 2015 in the light of relevant information that emerged in the local authority areas of Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin with regard to pyritic heave in a small number of housing developments in each of the two local authority areas.</p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence. The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.  Similar factors would need to be examined by the Pyrite Resolution Board in advance of extending the scheme to other areas, given the scheme is ultimately one of last resort.</p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information: -</p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore;</p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite;</p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;</p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;</p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;</p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and</p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.  In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area, i.e. do the problems stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.  </p><p>In regard to home ownership and the eligibility criterion, the Act also sets out the broad parameters which the Board must have regard to when establishing the eligibility criteria for the pyrite remediation scheme. </p><p>Section 15(3) of the Act, which prevents applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013 (the publication date of the Bill), applies where that person knew or ought to have known that the dwelling was constructed using hardcore containing reactive pyrite. </p><p>I understand that Section 15(3) does not represent a blanket exclusion preventing applications being made under the scheme by a person who purchases a dwelling on or after 12 December 2013. It is, however, a matter for the Board to determine, based on facts and evidence in each individual case, whether an applicant is or is not entitled to apply for inclusion into the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p><p>It is important to note that, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Board is independent in the performance of its functions, and as Minister, I have no role in the operational matters relating to the implementation of the scheme.  The Board may be contacted directly by phone at Locall 1890 252842 or by email to info@pyriteboard.ie or alternatively at oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie.</p><p>Since my appointment as Minister, I have had the opportunity to meet many of the bodies that operate under my aegis of my Department and I intend to meet with the Pyrite Resolution Board in relation to its important work in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Part 7A of the Residential Tenancies Acts was introduced to facilitate the investigation of &ldquo;improper conduct&rdquo; and to provide for sanctions against landlords should it be warranted.  Significantly the investigation can now be triggered by the RTB in it&rsquo;s own right rather than depending on a complaint or the raising of an adjudication/dispute by the tenant.</p>  <p>  The matter of illegal evictions is a very serious one.  Where a landlord is determined to have engaged in an illegal eviction, the landlord may be directed to allow the tenant to re-enter the dwelling. Further, a landlord may also be required to pay substantial damages (up to &euro;20,000) depending on the circumstances of the case. Tenants can take a case to the RTB where an illegal eviction has occurred.  As the RTB have replaced the courts in the dispute resolution functions, the RTB has a responsibility towards all parties involved in a dispute to ensure that a fair hearing is conducted and that each party will have the opportunity to set out their case. Any decision will be made based on the facts and evidence of a given case. </p>  <p>  The RTB has confirmed to me that a dispute has been received and a case has been raised in relation to this matter.  They are actively reviewing and assessing all available information to ascertain if they can commence an investigation under Part 7A of the Act.  It is not possible for me to comment further at this time on the specifics of this case or the actions that are or may be taken on foot of the alleged illegal eviction. To do so could prejudice the  dispute process and role of the RTB.  The RTB must ensure it is independent and impartial to ensure that the integrity of its functions (including the resolution of disputes and imposition of sanctions) is upheld at all times.</p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to ensuring that we have the strongest protections possible, balancing the need for fairness, and with this in mind I have directed the RTB, under Section 151(2) of the Residential Tenancies Acts, to fully investigate this incident and to make a report to me, with relevant recommendations, as soon as possible.  This cannot be done until such times as the case has concluded, at which point the RTB will submit their findings to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  On receipt of its report I will swiftly consider it and move to implement any relevant recommendations that will further protect tenants. </p></reply>

Initial Regulations in relation to schemes of priorities were made subsequently and further Regulations are being developed regarding eligibility and other matters.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of section 84(2)(c) of the Act, a household will normally be ineligible for an affordable dwelling purchase arrangement where the household or any household member has previously purchased or built a dwelling for his or her occupation, or for any other purpose, in the State.</p>  <p>  However, section 84(5) provides that where a household requires to relocate to a different dwelling or different administrative area or both, section 84(2)(c) will not render a household ineligible where the household had previously purchased an affordable dwelling under Part 5 or under the previous legislative provisions in relation to affordable purchase arrangements (now repealed).</p>  <p>  The question of whether a household "requires" to relocate would be a matter for the housing authority to determine under section 84(5). However, the need for any further detail or guidance on this matter will be considered in the context of Regulations to be made in the coming months or in guidelines to be issued by my Department.</p>  <p>  This Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society and this is reflected in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future. In terms of affordable housing more generally, I will outline my detailed plans later in the Autumn, taking account of progress to date under existing measures such as the Serviced Sites Fund and the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan and informed by the input of key delivery partners.</p></reply>

Local authorities have a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes.  An initial three-month waiver of rates for businesses forced to close business due to COVID-19, was announced in early May.  In order to enhance the supports available for enterprise, and in recognition of the fact that not only were many ratepayers forced to close business due to the public health requirements, but many that remained open suffered significant reductions in turnover, the waiver has been extended from three to six months, until 27 September 2020.  The categories of eligible enterprise have also been expanded somewhat.</p>  <p>  A 100% waiver will be applied to all businesses, for the six-month period to 27 September, with the exception of a small number of categories. The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers is that their operations were not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately. To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for six months for eligible businesses, which will take the form of a credit in lieu of rates.</p>  <p>  In terms of extending the existing waiver beyond six months, there is no proposal at this stage to extend the waiver. Indeed, any extension would need to be considered in the context of the public health measures in place and the overall suite of business support measures made available by Government to date. </p></reply>

Indeed, I met with a number of stakeholder representative groups in July and will continue that engagement in the coming weeks. In the first place, my Department is currently preparing to set up the structures to examine the issue of defective housing, this will include apartment buildings.</p><p>Local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Building Control Acts, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure that immediate risks are addressed and that a plan is put in place, where required, for works to bring buildings into compliance. </p><p>In relation to developments where concerns over fire safety issues arise, when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, to the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; of the building. The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire. In multi-unit developments, the &quot;person having control&quot; is generally the Owner Management Company.  </p><p>Under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, (which is under the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality), the owner management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges and a sinking fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development. </p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements have arisen, the Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings was published in 2017. It is intended to be used as a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings (houses and apartments) where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern, to develop strategies to improve fire safety and to develop strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The Framework is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>I believe that the building control reform agenda, already well underway, provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding an enhanced culture of compliance and accountability within the construction industry and for strengthening the building control framework in Ireland.The reform agenda includes:</p><p>- amendments made to the Building Control Regulations;</p><p>- the National Building Control Management Project; and</p><p>- the ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>While my focus will remain on ensuring the full roll out of the building control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector meet their responsibilities and are appropriately held to account if they don't, I will also ensure that work continues in this important policy area of defects, in collaboration with other Departments and key stakeholders who have responsibilities in these matters, with a view to assisting owners of affected properties, in line with the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.  </p><p>Tenants who are currently (or at any stage between 9 March 2020 and 10 January 2021):</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) Illness Benefit for Covid-19 absence - further information available at - ); or</p><p>- in receipt of (or entitled to receive) the Temporary Wage Subsidy, Employment Wage Subsidy or any other social welfare payment or State support paid as a result of loss of earnings due to Covid-19 (this includes the rent supplement or a supplementary welfare allowance); </p><p>and</p><p>- at risk of losing their tenancy, </p><p>can receive the aforementioned protections to remain in their tenancy without any increase in rent until 11 January 2021. In order to qualify for these supports, tenants must complete and sign a Self-Declaration form, available on the Residential Tenancies Boards (RTB) website - www.rtb.ie, if they meet the above criteria and submit it to the RTB and their landlord.</p><p>The RTB and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) are working with tenants in rent arrears to outline the financial supports which may be available to enable the tenant to meet their rental obligations to sustain their tenancy. </p><p>My Department  has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - www.housing.gov.ie - and on the RTB's website - www.rtb.ie.</p><p>Tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord and, in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so on foot of Covid-19, they are encouraged to engage with their landlords at the earliest opportunity.  </p><p>Many Government departments, agencies and organisations are engaged in supporting landlords and tenants during this time, providing  information, advice and income supports to those who are facing financial difficulty. Tenants facing difficulty in meeting the rental payments should engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) as income supports and Rent Supplement are available to assist them.  Further information on these supports can be found by calling the DEASP Income Support Helpline for Covid-19 on 1890 800 024 or by visiting the DEASP website at:</p><p>social-protection/?referrer=https://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/home.aspx.</p><p>With Government funding, Threshold, the national housing charity, operates the Tenancy Protection Service. Further information is available on www.threshold.ie. The homeless and housing sections in local authorities continue to assist those who are not in a position to provide accommodation for themselves.</p><p>My Department and the RTB urge landlords to consider the negative impacts of Covid-19 on their tenants and to show forbearance where temporary rent arrears might arise. Tenants and landlords are urged to discuss any problems promptly, keep lines of communication open and respect each other&rsquo;s positions. If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on www.rtb.ie.</p><p>For tenancies other than those in rent arrears, the existing laws on how to end a tenancy apply again from 2 August 2020. Tenancy terminations are now permitted to be served in such cases and tenants must vacate on the termination date specified in a valid Notice of Termination.</p><p>For all landlords who served a Notice of Termination before the enactment of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 on 27 March 2020 and had the termination notice period paused, those notice periods recommenced with effect from 2 August 2020.</p></reply>

As we have set out in the Programme for Government, we are working to ensure that the New Decade, New Approach agreement is implemented in full. </p>  <p>  The Government published a series of commitments at the time of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. These commitments are focused on working with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. </p>  <p>  The Government was pleased to host the 24th plenary meeting of the NSMC in Dublin Castle on 31 July, and to see sectoral work underway across the areas of North-South cooperation. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to enhancing, developing and deepening all aspects of North South Cooperation.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to enhancing the role of the British Irish Council and the British Irish Governmental Conference (BIIGC). </p>  <p>  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is prioritising the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the all island economy in the context of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations, and the full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.  We continue to raise the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of Brexit, including most recently in relation to the UK's Internal Market Bill.  The Northern Ireland Protocol is specifically designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the peace process, and any unilateral departure from its implementation is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  We have called on the British Government to step back from this deeply concerning approach and to work now to repair the trust that is needed to successfully and faithfully implement the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol. A positive resolution to this issue is in all our interests. </p></reply>

Any unilateral attempt to undermine the Withdrawal Agreement, or a unilateral departure from its terms, would be a very concerning and serious step. </p><p>This is a fundamental issue of trust between the EU and the UK. </p><p>With regard to the elements of the UK&rsquo;s Internal Market Bill, the Taoiseach raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns - which are grave - directly with Prime Minister Johnson, on Wednesday, 9 September, the day that the Bill was published. </p><p>Ireland participated in the EU-UK Joint Committee on Implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement on 10 September, and further raised our concerns. At that meeting, EU Co-Chair and Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic urged the British Government to remove the problematic measures from the Bill. </p><p>I recall, as Deputies will be very well aware, that the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is specifically designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. </p><p>It is designed to operate in all circumstances, including in the absence of an agreement on the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK. </p><p>The UK&rsquo;s Internal Market Bill, if it were implemented, would seriously damage and erode political trust between the EU and the UK, and would undermine stability in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The Protocol was the product of long, difficult, detailed negotiations and represents a delicately balanced compromise by all sides. It was agreed because of the multitude of complex and sensitive issues that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU raised for the island of Ireland. Its safeguards, therefore, remain essential in all circumstances.</p><p>We urge the British Government to reconsider their approach to the Internal Market Bill, in line with Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic&rsquo;s request, and work to repair the trust that is needed to successfully and faithfully implement the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol.</p><p>A positive resolution to this issue is in all our interests.</p><p>We remain in close and ongoing contact on this with our EU colleagues. </p></reply>

Should this become the official policy of the Polish Government, I would be concerned by such a policy. It is my understanding that the Polish Prime Minister has decided to submit a motion to Poland's Constitutional Tribunal to examine the compliance of the Istanbul Convention with the Polish Constitution. </p>  <p>  Ireland has joined with other EU Member States in highlighting our concerns, emphasising that the Convention is the key international treaty to combat violence against women and domestic violence and that this is its sole objective.</p>  <p>  Ireland has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combatting violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention. The Convention is a significant international legal instrument which requires criminalising or legally sanctioning different forms of violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual harassment and psychological violence.</p>  <p>  Domestic and sexual violence can have devastating consequences for victims as well as society as a whole. When we ratified the Convention, it sent an important message that Ireland does not tolerate such violence. To date, all EU Member States have signed the treaty, and 21 EU Member States, including Poland, have ratified it. Poland is an EU Member State with which we share many values and interests, and its withdrawal from the Convention would be regrettable.</p>  <p>  Once we develop a clearer understanding of the Polish Government&rsquo;s position on this, we will seek to discuss the issue further with Polish counterparts in the appropriate fora at ministerial and official level.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work both bilaterally and at the EU level to promote and protect the rights of women across the EU and beyond.</p></reply>

The rule of law is and should remain a fundamental principle that all EU Member States respect, protect and promote. </p><p>Our concerns about issues relating to the rule of law in Hungary are well known, specifically developments in the areas of judicial independence, the civil society space, media freedom, academic freedom and fundamental rights. </p><p>At an EU level, as part of the Article 7 procedure, there have been a number of hearings at General Affairs Councils over the past two years involving the Commission, Hungary and other Member States. We have actively participated, highlighting the importance we attach to respect for the rule of law. On 22 September, the General Affairs Council will again consider the situation in Hungary. We encourage Hungary to continue to work with the Commission and fellow Member States to address these concerns. </p><p>We also use all opportunities at both political and official level to raise our concerns bilaterally with the Government of Hungary. </p><p>We will continue to work with fellow Member States and the EU institutions, as well as at the bilateral level, to ensure that the rule of law is upheld across the Union.</p></reply>

The circumstances around the recent shootings in Wisconsin and Portland are alarming and highlight the harm that can arise from division in a society. We are witnessing sustained months of protests in the US decrying racism and issues of racial inequality. Wherever such social inequalities and injustices exist, voices must be heard. The right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are fundamental values in any democratic society. </p>  <p>  Democratic States have a duty to ensure their laws are respected and implemented, and to safeguard and police their communities. As I stated in June, this duty must, however, be discharged in a proportionate and accountable manner, avoiding excessive use of force and in line with international obligations. I continue to call for a de-escalation of tensions in the United States, and for a deepening of engagement and constructive dialogue at all levels to address the underlying issues of racial inequality, which has given rise to the protests.  </p>  <p>  The events over the past months in the US have also sharply brought into focus the need to examine our own society and any prejudices we may hold, and I welcome the debate it has opened up in Ireland. We must continually strive to become a more inclusive society in which people are not afraid to speak out about their experiences of racism, and in favour of a society in which discrimination is not tolerated. Our Programme for Government clearly outlines new commitments to build a society which reflects these values. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the United States enjoy close political, economic and cultural relations. It is not comfortable to witness unrest in a country where so many of us have such close personal connections. As part of our regular dialogue, I have raised our concerns with the US Ambassador to Ireland on a number of occasions. We will also continue to monitor developments and to engage with those in community and political leadership on these issues, through our diplomatic missions in the United States.</p></reply>

Ireland, and the EU, have made it repeatedly clear that the violence must stop and that those unjustly detained, including political prisoners, must be released and thorough investigations of rights abuses conducted. </p>  <p>  Our concern for the welfare of the Belorussian people, whose connections with the people of Ireland are well known, is central to our approach in contributing to EU positions, including at the UN Human Rights Council and the Council of Europe. </p>  <p>  We continue to work constructively with our EU partners to impose sanctions on individuals responsible for falsifying the election result and the unacceptable violence we have seen. We believe a firm message must be sent. </p>  <p>  We are also clear that the future of Belarus is for its people to decide and the EU has offered its support and assistance to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in its efforts to facilitate a national dialogue between the authorities and civil society. We continue to explore a full range of supports to the Belorussian people with our EU colleagues, including diverting EU funding to civil society, the health sector and vulnerable persons.   </p>  <p>  The best way for Ireland to respond to this situation is by working with our EU partners and through the OSCE to try to secure a democratic resolution with full respect of fundamental rights, and this is what we will continue to do, including at the next Foreign Affairs Council where there will be a specific discussion on the situation in Belarus.</p></reply>

The Passport Service commenced a phased return to full operation on 8 June and has since processed over 140,000 passport applications. The re-opening of the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork to the public is kept under regular review, with due consideration being given to public health protection measures. </p>  <p>  The Passport Online Service has been fully operational since 8 June. The awarding-winning Passport Online Service is the cheapest and most convenient way to apply for a passport. It provides a user-friendly process which is available 24/7 to those seeking to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. Children&rsquo;s passports can also be renewed online. Applicants in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain and Europe who are applying for the first time are also eligible to use the online service. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently meeting the target turnaround times for Passport Online applications. This is 5 working days for simple applications and 10 working days for complex applications, once the supporting documentation has been received. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service resumed processing paper-based postal passport applications through the Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express services on 4 August. The target turnaround time for processing paper-based applications is 6-8 weeks. </p>  <p>  Whilst the public offices in Dublin and Cork are not open to callers at present, the Passport Service continues to operate a Customer Service Hub via phone and webchat which deals with approximately 3,600 customer enquiries per week. The customer service team is able to resolve most queries at the first point of contact. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has also maintained its emergency service throughout the public health emergency. The emergency service is available for those who are required to travel urgently due to the death or serious illness of a family member or because the applicant requires emergency medical treatment. Members of the public who require an emergency service should contact the Customer Service Hub.</p></reply>

It is a relief that there are no reported deaths or injuries, but the very sudden displacement of thousands of people has caused great suffering and created a major humanitarian emergency as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the COVID pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart on 9 September immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities have now requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising. My Department is actively looking at this request and identifying what immediate assistance we can provide to the Greek authorities from our humanitarian logistics base at Brindisi. </p>  <p>  In regard to raising the issue at the Foreign Affairs Council, I understand that Greece will take the opportunity at raise this issue at the relevant upcoming Councils.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. We have also committed to accept 36 unaccompanied minors in need of international protection in Greece, and I was pleased that the first group of eight such minors arrived in Ireland last June. We stand ready to consider any further requests that may be made to us, in the context of dealing with the very difficult situation now arising following the destruction of Moria refugee camp.</p></reply>

The Report was accepted in full by Government and, to facilitate implementation, an extensive High Level Plan titled "Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date.</p>  <p>  The PSPC report contains a broad range of recommendations which have provided immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. Immediate benefits included a 10% increase in military service allowance; the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances; the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties and the restoration of a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots. </p>  <p>  The Report provides for an examination of pay structures in the PDF and the identification of other retention measures, which will be progressed within the framework of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Report also contains a range of other recommendations including a review of recruitment methods, enhanced workforce planning, enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF, the development of further non-pay retention measures and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas. </p>  <p>  Work on implementing the recommendations has been ongoing within my Department since the implementation plan was published in July 2019. However, the Covid-19 emergency impacted project timeframes for many of the remaining projects. For some projects resources were necessarily reassigned to matters relating to the COVID-19 response. In other instances, there were challenges in terms of progressing projects via remote means and where other essential work necessarily took priority. However these challenges are being overcome and work on all of the outstanding projects has resumed.  Projects are being progressed as quickly as is possible in the circumstances. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the High Level Implementation Plan, PDFORRA have had three briefing sessions provided by the Program Management Office on the status of projects under the plan.  </p>  <p>  The Representative Associations have also been invited to submit any material that they wish to be considered relating to any of the projects. I can confirm that my Department will fully engage with the Representative Associations on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, as and when Official side proposals are finalised.</p></reply>

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>In May last year F&oacute;rsa trade union tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 pay agreement.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies are in discussions with F&oacute;rsa under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p></reply>

It is the aim of my Department that every child has access to equitable education and that each learner feels safe and happy in the school environment, at every stage. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the current curriculum acknowledges the importance of a balanced and informed awareness of the diversity of peoples and environments in the world. Such an awareness helps children to understand the world and contributes to their personal and social development as citizens of a global community. The curriculum promotes tolerance and respect for diversity in both the school and the community. The Primary Curriculum is currently complemented by Guidelines on Traveller Education in Primary Schools (DES, 2002) and Intercultural Education in the Primary School (NCCA, 2005). These guidelines promote an intercultural approach in the classroom and provide practical examples of how intercultural themes, including Traveller culture, can be accommodated through the various curriculum areas. They aim to contribute to the development of a shared ability and sense of responsibility to protect for each other the right to be different and to live free from discrimination.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum Assessment, (NCCA), is currently in the process of redesigning and redeveloping the primary curriculum and through an ongoing public consultation is providing an opportunity to all stakeholders to consider how it may be restructured. Inclusive education and diversity is one of eight overarching principles of the draft PC framework and provides for equity of opportunity and participation in children&rsquo;s learning. Inclusive education celebrates diversity and responds to the uniqueness of every child. </p>  <p>  While the Department prescribes curricula and syllabuses for implementation in primary schools, it does not endorse any textbooks for use in schools. Neither does the Department have any involvement in the publication of such textbooks, beyond informing publishers in a timely fashion about the introduction of any new syllabus.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, schools have the autonomy to determine which textbooks and/or resources to use in order to best aid the delivery of the curriculum, however there some prescribed texts for English at both junior and senior cycle. A diverse range of authors, including poets and playwrights, is included in the prescribed lists of texts. The texts referred to are not compulsory, but are options on a wider list of prescribed texts. Which text is used in a school remains at the discretion of that school.</p>  <p>  A variety of factors influence the selection of prescribed texts, including the aspiration to achieve social and cultural diversity and inclusivity, the age appropriateness of texts, the merit of the text on grounds of excellence, as well as practical factors, such as availability and cost. As prescribed lists are developed from year to year, additional factors come to the fore and influence the choices made. Contemporary issues and world events also impact on prescription. It is the intention that prescribed texts for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate English are diverse and inclusive, and meet the needs of teachers and students. Current and previous text lists offer many opportunities to explore issues relating to racism and inclusion/exclusion of particular groups in society. Achieving a balanced list remains a challenging and worthwhile endeavour and work continues to create a broadly balanced, diverse and inclusive list every year.</p>  <p>  As part of this Department&rsquo;s ongoing curricular reform, issues in relation to inclusivity/diversity etc. will be considered as part of the ongoing reviews in relation to the curriculum at both primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The NCCA is also in the process of conduction a review of senior cycle. The NCCA commenced the review in late 2016. As part of the first phase of the review the NCCA conducted international research on senior cycle in a number of other jurisdictions. The report of this research was published in February 2018.  From September 2018, the NCCA engaged with a cohort of schools as well as hosted a series of national seminars. This was followed by a wider public consultation. This phase of consultation was informed by two important NCCA documents, an Interim report of review of Senior Cycle Education and accompanying Senior Cycle Review Consultation Document. The Interim Report on the review brings together the discussions held during the review in schools, at the national seminars and the national and international research on senior cycle, while the Senior Cycle Consultation document outlines the emerging areas for further consideration in senior cycle. Elements of the review are examining how senior cycle can be inclusive to students from all backgrounds. The NCCA are now considering the findings to date and are working to produce an advisory report.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has also been progressing work on the issue of the place of Traveller history and culture in the curriculum, from early years to senior cycle, in order to identify current opportunities for children and young people to encounter and learn about aspects of Traveller culture and history. As part of this process the Council has engaged directly with Traveller repreesentative bodies.  </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to address the areas such as cultural awareness through a suite of supports including the recently revised Stay Safe Programme and the provision of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to teachers at Primary and Post-Primary level and in initial teacher education. It will ensure that such programmes enable teachers to deal with teaching and learning needs of all students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this vital aspect of education to young people. Importantly, a school&rsquo;s RSE programme should be planned in consultation with parents.  </p>  <p>  The entire focus of RSE is on preparing young people for adult life, on emphasising the importance of respect for themselves and each other, developing healthy relationships, understanding the importance of consent and helping young people to develop and mature in a positive light. This will be done in a manner that is appropriate to the ages of children.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, a review of RSE in schools was announced by the then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton TD. The Minister asked the NCCA to undertake a review, not just of the content of the curriculum but of how it is taught in schools. The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in schools.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA conducted a thorough and transparent review, and published its report, &ldquo;Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary Schools&rdquo; in December 2019. </p>  <p>  The NCCA report makes a number of recommendations. This includes primarily the development of a single integrated curriculum for RSE and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) in schools. Work on updating or developing new specifications for SPHE/RSE will commence in the NCCA in 2021, beginning with a focus on Junior Cycle. This work will include engagement with all the key education stakeholders as well as a further process of public consultation before any new curriculum specifications are finalised.   </p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. These groups were unable to commence their work over recent months due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings. However, meetings of these groups will convene from October and this will allow them to review significant work that has been progressed.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA is currently developing interim guidance for SPHE and RSE across primary and post-primary levels. These support materials will be made available in the form of an online toolkit. They will provide guidance on how the current curriculum can be approached in a more holistic way. The materials involved will be brought to the development groups from October. It is anticipated that some guidance materials will be published before the end of 2020 and that they will be supplemented incrementally during 2021. </p>  <p>  The NCCA has worked collaboratively with the teacher professional development support services and other relevant groups in completing an audit of current teaching and learning resources relevant to SPHE/RSE and compiled a comprehensive resource list which will be published as part of the online toolkit for SPHE/RSE. This will provide a single, online access point for up-to-date resources.   </p>  <p>  Further recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE are being considered by the Department with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.</p></reply>

However, parents/guardians making an application/payment at this time for the 2020/2021 school year are reminded that the closing date for payments for the 2020/21 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020.  </p>  <p>  Bus Eireann has confirmed that payment for ticket for the child referred to by the Deputy was received on the 7th September 2020 for the 2020/2021 school year and such their payment is late. </p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  Payments for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4th August 2020 will be only considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route.  In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place.  Covid-19 response plans are the means through which schools can best prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 in the school environment.

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme Primary children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  Post Primary children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.  </p><p>All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation.</p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p><p>Concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s post primary school education cycle.

It is intended to convene the Steering Group shortly and to agree and supplement revised terms of reference to reflect the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Review will build on the proposals in the Programme for Government, which sets out the following objectives: </p>  <p>  -  Accelerate sustainable transport plans for schools. We will complete the review of the School Transport Scheme to seek better outcomes and reduce car journeys. The School Transport Scheme should work in liaison with the Safe Routes to Schools Programme </p>  <p>  -  We will conduct a comprehensive review of the School Transport Scheme, identifying recommendations for the scheme to provide better value and a better service for students, including those with special educational needs, and examining issues such as the nearest or next-nearest school.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  School transport services resumed operation on the 26th of August 2020.  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is conducting a full assessment to see where re-organisation or re-scheduling of services is possible. In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently invited applications from operators who wish to be considered for the provision of additional post-primary services that may be required. </p></reply>

A pre-planning meeting was held with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council earlier in the year and this is informing the design for the project. Lodgement of the Planning Application will be the next key milestone in the progression of the project.  To this end, the final pre-planning meeting is due to be held with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council on the 23rd September next.  My Department's Project Manager for the Design and Build programme is working towards submission of the planning application as soon as possible.  Until such time as planning permission has been secured, it will not be possible to provide a timeline for progression of the project to tender and construction stages.</p>  <p>  Regarding the school&rsquo;s interim accommodation, my Department has approved the provision of funding, under the Additional Accommodation Scheme, to provide for prefabricated accommodation for the school to meet its short to medium term accommodation needs at its current location. Some issues during the tendering process led to delays in the delivery of this project to the extent that it was not going to be completed in time to allow the school to open there for September.</p>  <p>  The school authority worked closely with officials in my Department with a view to providing interim solutions to meet the needs of the school pending completion of this project. In that context, it was agreed that an existing ETB building would be refurbished with a view to facilitating its use for that purpose. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this work was completed last week and the building is now in use by the school.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>-  2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>-  A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>-  The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here .</p></reply>

The appeals criteria are set out in Circular 18/2020, &quot;Staffing Arrangements for Primary Schools for the 2020/21 School Year&quot;.My Department has not received a staffing appeal from the school referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>The Roadmap for Full Return to School set outs the plan for the safe and sustainable reopening of our schools.  It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the Roadmap for Society and Business, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with education stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives.</p><p>My Department is providing capital and current funding of an additional &euro;377 million to support implementation of the roadmap. The supports are comprehensive across a range of areas and involve funding for measures such as PPE, hand sanitisation, enhanced cleaning and hygiene, physical distancing, management supports and substitution provision. It is also recognised that schools may require some reconfiguration works and this is supported by a once off enhanced minor works grant of &euro;75 million to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening including an uplift for schools with SEN pupils. </p><p>The public health guidance recognises that the ability to achieve 1m physical distancing for junior infants to 2<sup>nd</sup>classes is not a prerequisite for facilitating a full return of all pupils.  While there is the requirement for 1m physical distancing for the senior classes (3<sup>rd</sup>class to 6<sup>th</sup>class) schools also have the flexibility to organise their classes into bubbles and pods. The requirement in the public health guidance is for each pod to be 1m apart as distinct from each pupil in the pods. </p><p>My Department has published practical guidance for schools to help achieve physical distancing in line with public health advice and include:</p><p>-  Reconfiguring classroom accommodation through the removal of unnecessary items of furniture, shelving etc.  </p><p>-  Using the largest classrooms for the senior classes</p><p>-  Reviewing the size of each class so that there is a more even spread of pupils between each class</p><p>-  Maximising available space within the footprint of the school </p><p>-  If necessary, look at opportunities for sourcing any nearby accommodation for a large class e.g. parish hall, sports facilities etc.  The Department supports same through the minor works grant and additional funding can be provided where necessary.</p><p>The public health advice recognises that the implementation of physical distancing will look different across the various ages and stages of learning and that a balanced and common sense approach should be applied in the implementation of measures, allowing for some flexibility when needed whilst noting that it must be applied in a practical way, recognising that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue.</p><p>Schools have an option of an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board should they continue to experience difficulties, having first taken measures necessary to achieve physical distancing in line with published guidance.</p></reply>

A key focus for the Inspectorate during the first term is on advising and supporting schools as they re-open and students settle back into the routine of schooling. Schools are being offered an opportunity to participate in Inspectorate-led advisory sessions (online and face-to-face) focusing on student well-being, teaching and learning, and assessment and the promotion of school self-evaluation. There will also be a strong emphasis on the needs of vulnerable learners during these advisory sessions. </p>  <p>  Evaluation work for the first term will focus on a small number of priority inspections including the completion of inspections commenced prior to school closure and risk-based inspections such as child protection and safeguarding inspections and urgent follow through inspections.   Furthermore, the Inspectorate will carry out a programme of visits to schools to provide advice and support in the implementation of public health advice  and the Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 Response Plans for schools. As well as supporting school communities, these visits will also provide an assurance to the Department and public that schools are a safe working and learning environment for teachers, other school staff and for learners. </p>  <p>  The Inspectorate will also engage in research work to identify and disseminate effective practice and will conduct regular surveys of stakeholders in schools, the outcomes of which will inform the provision of supports and any necessary additional guidance to schools. </p>  <p>  The specific activities included in the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work programme will be kept under review and will evolve in line with public health advice and the prevailing health circumstances. Further information on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work for the 2020/21 school year is available  in Circulars 0040/2020, 0041/2020 and 0042/2020 on the Department of Skills website at www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars.</p></reply>

This roadmap set out how schools would reopen for all students from the end of August.  It was developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the Roadmap for Society and Business and followed comprehensive and intensive engagement with all relevant stakeholders including Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority on the logistical considerations that arise in planning for the operation of school transport services for the reopening of our schools.  </p>  <p>  School Transport Scheme services for primary school pupils, including services for children with special educational needs, operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department are fully operating as normal in line with public health advice for the 2020/2021 school year with the appropriate hygiene and other measures in place.   </p>  <p>  Observing hygiene requirements is a key priority and my Department has issued clear communications to all parents and students using school transport services to set out the requirements for those travelling on services. </p>  <p>  Following the most recent advice from NPHET, the Government decided that the post-primary scheme (including post-primary services for pupils with special educational needs) would commence operation when schools re-open with additional measures in place, such as pre-assigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50% of passenger capacity, on the post- primary services as required.  </p>  <p>  Given the timing of this most recent advice from NPHET so close to the start of the new term, my Department has not withdrawn post-primary transport services for pupils with special educational needs as to do so would cause difficulty for many families in getting their children to school.  My Department has engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement measures so that any services that could operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity have done so and over the coming period all other services for children of post-primary school going age will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing.  </p>  <p>  Every effort continues to provide a safe transport service for all pupils. However, if parents/guardians decide not to avail of transport services they may request a refund on the cost of their ticket for the 2020/2021 school year. Parents have been asked to inform my Department if they wish to avail of this option.</p></reply>

The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings and that primary school students should distance where possible.</p>  <p>  Following the most recent advice from NPHET, the Government decided that the post-primary scheme (including post-primary services for pupils with special educational needs) would commence operation when schools re-open with additional measures in place, such as pre-assigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50% of passenger capacity, on the post- primary services as required.  </p>  <p>  Given the timing of this most recent advice from NPHET so close to the start of the new term, my Department has not withdrawn post-primary transport services for pupils with special educational needs as to do so may have caused difficulty for many families in getting their children to school. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement measures so that any services that could operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity have done so and over the coming period all other services for children of post-primary school going age will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p>  <p>  Every effort continues to provide a safe transport service for all pupils and my Department has issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year.  However, if parents/guardians of  children on post-primary transport services for  children with special educational needs decide not to use school transport for the 2020/2021 school year, in light of the impact of most recent health advice, the Department will provide a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements. Parents/guardians have been contacted directly and  asked to inform the Department if they wish to avail of this option. </p></reply>

The purpose of the investigation is to allow students to experience the practical application of the core geographical skills that are central to all units of the syllabus including physical, regional, human and economic geography.  Students are required to identify aims, objectives and hypotheses for their investigation, select and use methods of collection and gathering appropriate to the chosen investigation topic, analyse and interpret results, draw valid conclusions and prepare a report.</p>  <p>  The topic for the investigation must be chosen from an annual list of prescribed topics issued from the State Examinations Commission.  The list of prescribed topics is prepared to ensure that the range of topics relate to as many of the units of the syllabus as possible including physical, regional, human and economic geography.  This broad scope also ensures that the geographical investigation is accessible to as broad a range of learners and learning environments.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the list of topics provides scope and flexibility for a broad range of approaches to the investigation which may include the undertaking of a field study or an investigation which may involve desk based research.  The 2021 investigation topics include a study of changing land-use, impact of migration, a local environmental issue, geology in a local area, impact of economic activity and impact of erosion on the landscape.  The collection and gathering of information for each of these topics may involve gathering data through outside the school vis-&agrave;-vis an field study, survey, questionnaire etc.  Alternatively, data may be collected using primary and secondary data available from journals, databases, government departments, published reports etc.</p>  <p>  Some students may have the collection and gathering of data completed at this stage and in such cases they should complete their analysis and write up their report.  In cases where the collection and gathering of data has not being undertaken,  the flexibility of approach provided by the range of prescribed topics should be considered when choosing a topic for the geographical investigation in order that the investigation can be completed in line with public health requirements and guidelines.  Any activity undertaken as part of the investigation should be done in compliance with these requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Department has also published a series of guidance documents as part of the reopening of our schools. These are available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p>  <p>  This includes guidance regarding practical subjects in post-primary schools. While this guidance does not specifically name Geography, the guidance provided in provided in relation to Science is applicable. The guidelines outline areas that may be considered when schools are making decisions about implementing the curriculum, while acknowledging that teachers are best placed to consider how to safely manage equipment within current public health guidelines as they may account for their own local context. </p>  <p>  For example, the guidance advises that where the sharing of equipment between students cannot be avoided, each piece of shared equipment should be cleaned/wiped between each use and that group sizes should be kept as small as resources allow. </p>  <p>  The additional funding for the reopening of schools has been provided specifically for the safe reopening of schools. This includes funding for substitute teachers, aides for school restructuring, minor works, PPE and additional cleaning. Schools typically use their capitation grant to purchase curricular related materials and equipment.  </p></reply>

A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains representatives of the Department&rsquo;s Statistics and Social Inclusion Units, the Inspectorate and the Educational Research Centre. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspect of this model has commenced. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need and will be applied on the same basis across the country.</p>  <p>  I am  confident that the culmination of this work will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. Until this work is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

Students may wish to have access to and consider this data if they are considering an appeal of their Calculated Grade. </p><p>Students who are disappointed with the Calculated Grades they have received in one or more subjects will have the opportunity to submit an appeal. </p><p>The appeals process is a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process. </p><p>It is not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school is outside of the appeals process. </p><p>It should further be noted that the design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process is also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p><p>The appeals process has opened on 14 September and students can access this via the Calculated Grades Student Portal. Students will have until 5.00 pm on 16 September to submit an appeal.</p><p>The appeal process will include three stages:</p><p>Stage 1: Checks will be undertaken on the forms completed by the school and that the information was transferred correctly from the forms to the data collection system.</p><p>Stage 2: There will be a review to ensure that the data was correctly received and processed through the systems used in the national standardisation process conducted by the Department. </p><p>Data checks will include a check to ensure that the rank order of the class group for the subject and level taken has been preserved in the standardisation process and that students placed on the same school-estimated mark in the same subject and at the same level taken by the school are conferred with the same calculated mark.</p><p>Stages 1 and 2 will be taken together.</p><p>Stage 3: Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process can invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These Scrutineers are independent of the Department.</p><p>The Independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The Scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered at Stages 1 and 2.  </p><p>Students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p><p>If following the appeals process students  remain dissatisfied with the outcome, students  will be able to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams. Subject to public health advice, these will begin on 16 November. Further details about these exams will be provided by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) at a later stage.

The objective is to limit contact and sharing of common facilities between people in different Class Bubbles (and Pods within those Class Bubbles) as much as possible, rather than to avoid all contact between Pods, as this will not always be possible.</p>  <p>  Whenever possible, pupils and teaching staff should consistently be in the same Class Bubbles. Different Class Bubbles should have separate breaks and mealtimes or occupy separate areas at break or mealtimes. Movement of staff members between Class Bubbles should be limited as much as possible.</p>  <p>  While recognising that each school is different in terms of location, physical layout and available space, school themselves are best placed to decide on appropriate changes necessary to maintain physical distancing. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.</p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>  Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is conducting a full assessment to see where re-organisation or re-scheduling of services is possible. In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently invited applications from operators who wish to be considered for the provision of additional post-primary services that may be required. </p>  <p>  As of the 11th September 2020 there were 2206 mainstream Post Primary routes in operation. 20% of these routes are operating at 50% capacity while in the region of 52% of SEN post-primary services are operating at 50% capacity with planning being undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement the remaining routes on a rolling basis.  This process will take into account procurement guidelines and compliance with driver vetting and safety procedures consistent with the operation of school transport services. </p></reply>

During these inspections, specially trained inspectors evaluate the quality of centre management and leadership, the quality of teaching, learning and assessment, and the centre's own planning and self-review. They provide oral feedback to the staff and board of management (where applicable) at the end of these inspections and then provide a written report which is published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Department inspectors have been conducting Youthreach evaluations since 2005 and are very experienced in evaluating the work carried out in the centres. A range of inspection models is used in Youthreach Centres including: Whole-Centre Evaluations, Incidental Inspections and Follow-Through Inspections. These models have been designed and approved by the Minister for Education following consultation with stakeholders, including stakeholders involved in the provision of education in Youthreach centres. Inspectors are provided with specialised training on these inspection models prior to conducting Centre Evaluations. Inspectors also gain experience and expertise through working on teams before taking a lead role in inspection work. </p>  <p>  Inspectors have a full understanding of the roles, level of experience and qualifications of Youthreach staff, including the role of the resource staff, and bring this understanding to bear when making professional judgements on the quality of provision. They do not differentiate between the work of teachers and resource persons in delivering QQI or Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) modules. Inspectors&rsquo; evaluative judgements are informed by the quality framework: Looking at Our School 2016 which is applicable to a range of contexts. Inspectors are trained to adapt the quality framework to take account of the unique context of Youthreach Centres when making judgements about the quality of provision. </p>  <p>  The ESRI conducted an evaluation of the national Youthreach programme, the report can be accessed here: www.esri.ie/system/files/publications/RS82_1.pdf. Work on reviewing the model of Youthreach inspection, as was recommended in the ESRI&rsquo;s report, is currently underway and will invole consultation with stakeholders involved in Youthreach provision.</p></reply>

In cases of doubt, an individual should raise the matter with my Department.</p>  <p>  Where a person is not eligible to receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment they may apply for a jobseeker payment.  Jobseekers Benefit is a social insurance based income support for people who have suffered a substantial loss of employment and satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.  If a person does not qualify for Jobseekers Benefit they may be eligible for means tested Jobseekers Allowance.  A person in receipt of a jobseekers payment may take up employment but they must be unemployed for 4 days in 7 consecutive days. </p>  <p>  The Department has put in place a mailbox dedicated to the Arts sector to raise queries directly with the Department at this time at artistspup@welfare.ie.  The Department also operates a scheme for self-employed Artists on Jobseeker's Allowance.  The scheme acknowledges the status of self-employed artists and writers and gives them a 12 month window to focus on building up their work before they become subject to labour market activation. </p>  <p>  I also wish to draw your attention to the Enterprise Support Grant which previously supported entrepreneurs who were setting up new enterprises but has now been extended to provide once-off supports for self-employed people who have been severely impacted and have had to cease operations as a result of the Pandemic.  The grant has been paid to over 1,000 self-employed persons and is payable up to &euro;1,000 to help small business owners who transition from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to re-open their business.  It is payable to self-employed micro enterprises that are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants. Details on the application process to access this grant is available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The July Stimulus package contained significant funding of some &euro;200 million in supports towards education, upskilling and work placements for people who are unemployed, to help them avail of employment opportunities as the economy gradually reopens.  Details of these employment support service measures to assist people back to work are available on www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>   Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments.  Information on the supports available under this scheme is available at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Employer Wage Subsidy Scheme is operated by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and  further information on this scheme is available at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>   I hope that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

ME is sometimes known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).</p><p>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Health that there is currently no known, specific, medical diagnostic test to determine or confirm a correct diagnosis of ME and no specific treatment which works for all sufferers is currently available.  I am also advised that, as a result &ndash; </p><p>-  clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient;</p><p>-  there are assessments and tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner;</p><p>-  specialised tests may be required when considering and ruling out other diagnoses;</p><p>-  relevant specialists are usually accessed through out-patient clinics at secondary care level; and</p><p>-  the General Practitioner is regarded as best placed to refer patients, if appropriate.</p><p>The medical review and assessment section of my Department exercises due care and diligence in assessing all applications for illness, disability and caring schemes.  </p><p>Disability Allowance is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability whose income falls below certain limits.  The criteria which must be satisfied to qualify for Disability Allowance are:</p><p>1.

It is paid to employees who are not working or self-employed who would be available to take up full-time employment. </p>  <p>  People aged 66 years and over are provided for through the contributory State pension or the non-contributory State means tested pension.  A person in receipt of the State contributory pension can retain their entire State pension and employment income.  If a person does not have the required number of contributions to receive the maximum rate of State Pension Contributory they may qualify for an increased rate of State non-contributory pension, depending on their circumstances.

People receiving the non-contributory State pension who also have employment income may have their pension payment increased if they lose their employment income due to the pandemic or it is reduced.  </p>  <p>  The rates payable on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is based on previous earnings or income.  The maximum rate of &euro;350 is being adjusted to &euro;300 with effect from 17 September and a further rate of &euro;250 is also being introduced.  The equivalent rates for State Pension contributory are &euro;470.80 for a couple and &euro;248.30 personal rate.

The Programme for Government commits that a Commission on Pensions will be established to examine a range of issues including contributions, calculation methods, sustainability, eligibility and intergenerational fairness.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  Proposals will be brought to Government in that regard as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Programme for Government also sets out how the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred and it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Commission on Pensions.  I will introduce legislation later this year to do that.  </p>  <p>  This Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s finances.  However, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before March 2021.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department held a series of meetings with CE supervisor representatives to consider related proposals, mindful of the operating environment in which any potential solution will need to exist.  Related discussions were also undertaken between Department officials and their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). </p>  <p>  My Department officials are continuing to work with the parties at present to try to establish a viable solution to this issue.</p></reply>

However, my Department has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events, such as flooding, under the humanitarian assistance scheme.</p><p>The purpose of the humanitarian assistance scheme is to provide income-tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repair. </p><p>In dealing with emergency events, my department adopts the following approach:  </p><p>-  Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments (including food, clothing and personal items) in the immediate aftermath of the event.</p><p>-  Stage 2 involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential items.  </p><p>-  Stage 3 is to identify what, if any, longer term financial support or works are required, including plastering, painting and relaying of floors. </p><p>The income test for humanitarian assistance is significantly more generous than that which applies in the case of means-tested social welfare schemes generally.  The basic principle of the income test is that individuals and families with average levels of income will qualify for assistance.  For example, a family consisting of a couple and two children with a gross household income of &euro;70,000 or less will receive 100% of the amount allowable in respect of their application.  A reduced or tapered level of support can be provided in cases where such families have income more than &euro;70,000.  The income test determines the household&rsquo;s ability to meet the costs of restoring its home to a habitable condition. </p><p>The scheme is available to provide support to householders following the recent flooding events, including in respect of flooding in West Cork and Clifden, Co Galway.  The Community Welfare Service has been engaging with a small number of households that have sought assistance. </p><p>If any homeowner affected by the recent flooding needs to access these supports, they should make contact with their local Community Welfare Service at the Intreo Centre in Clifden, or for Cork households, the contact details are  028-21047 or corkswa2020@welfare.ie. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The management of grant funding is governed by Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014 Management of and Accountability for Grants from Exchequer Funds which requires that all grants be expended by year end. While I would welcome further discussion in relation to this, the Public spending code and a move to providing long term or multi-annual funding is a matter for central Government and will require significant cross-government and legislative consideration.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, the number of grant funded agencies (section 56 and 59), including Family Resource Centres and other community and voluntary organisations funded by Tusla, has increased, as has the total amount of funding provided. My Department and Tusla have worked to promote investment in Prevention and Early Intervention, as well as develop a commissioning approach to ensure that funding and resources available to children and families, are used in the most effective, equitable and sustainable way possible.</p>  <p>  I will be seeking additional funding in Budget 2021, to ensure that these agencies and organisations continue to be supported in the coming year.  </p></reply>

The State pays the contribution in full or part for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees funding through SUSI.  </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact of the pandemic has had on our students. In July I announced the provision of additional student assistance including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education to assist with difficulties in accessing technology to facilitate their course work in a blended capacity.  These supports will be distributed through the colleges and further education providers. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government undertakes to provide a long term sustainable funding model for higher education.  In addition the range of student supports operated by SUSI will be subject to review. An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. </p>  <p>  In relation to the preparation underway for the new academic year in the context of the Covid pandemic, Higher Education Institutions have been undertaking detailed planning and contingencies for re-opening and communicating these to students and learners in the interest of public health of students, staff and communities, this will entail blended learning, combining both online and onsite provision. </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions have published their academic calendars, with information on the dates for orientation and the beginning of teaching for the autumn semester. Most have indicated in broad terms the balance of time for students between on-campus and online learning. I have highlighted the requirement for all HEIs to provide clarity to their students as soon as possible and to prioritise the overall student experience in line with public health advice. </p>  <p>  The delivery of further and higher education in the context of Covid-19 will cost the providers more not less.  The Government has provided additional funding in the amount of &euro;168m to support the return of students to further and higher education.  Since the student contribution is an important source of revenue for higher education it is not possible to abolish student contribution fees.  However the additional funding provided for student supports will be of assistance to many students particularly those with the least financial resources. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with further and higher education providers, agencies and key stakeholders including student representatives to mitigate the additional pressures faced as a result of covid-19.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address.

The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Student Grant Scheme is to provide additional assistance where parental income is below a certain threshold, or in the case of independent mature students, where the level of income of the student and his or her spouse warrants additional assistance by way of a grant. </p>  <p>  The scheme operates in the context of competing educational priorities and limited public funding. The aim of the scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college; covering the full cost has never been a feasible option. </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants are reviewed annually by the Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including student grants for the 2021/22 academic year, will be considered in the context of Budget 2021. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the Student Grant Scheme are applied impartially on a national basis, and accordingly it is not possible to make an exception in an individual case, regardless of circumstances. </p>  <p>  However, if an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. </p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe, (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant).

However this very diversity means that the development of one single plan for return to  learning would not have been possible. </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions have been undertaking detailed planning and contingencies for re-opening against a backdrop of Government, Departmental and sectoral guidance.</p>  <p>  To support the return to college in 2020, on July 22nd the Department published its three-pillar series of guides for returning to on-site learning in 2021, which consisted of a high-level roadmap, a COVID-19 adaptation framework, and practical guidance for returning to on-site activity. </p>  <p>  These have since been supplemented by Implementation Guidelines developed by experts within the higher education sector, published in August 5th.  All can be further updated and modified and additional guidance on managing outbreaks can be developed to follow the publication of the next iteration of Government guidance.</p>  <p>  A robust model of outbreak management is being put in place, as a priority, by the higher education system across all universities and institutes of technology. This aims to safeguard students and staff and the communities in which they are located. </p>  <p>  For international students, the higher education sector has developed a protocol of assurance, to support the protection of public health, to safely manage the process of their arrival in Ireland.  A managed arrival process is in place at Dublin airport to minimise risk during the period of arrival of international students into the country and transfer to their accommodation for the restricted movement period.</p></reply>

Over 16,700 laptops have already been procured as part of a bulk order organised by HEAnet, while additional devices are being procured by some providers directly.</p>  <p>  The higher and further education providers will determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the grant. Students who wish to apply for a device should contact the relevant higher education institution or ETB for further information. </p>  <p>  In the higher education sector, grants are made available to those institutions that receive support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) therefore any college that does not receive funding under the SAF did not come under the terms of the ICT grant.  </p></reply>

This document was produced by public health exerts within the HEI sector and the recommendations in it were endorsed by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE.</p>  <p>  The guidelines on student accommodation, including those in relation to visitors, are designed to reduce the risk of spread in student accommodation given the fact that it's a relatively dense-congregated setting with common areas shared between a number of students. The aim is to reduce to the pathways for the virus to enter a student accommodation setting, and help protect all those sharing the accommodation.</p>  <p>  Student accommodation license terms including cost, duration, refund and cancellation policies should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. While I would hope that accommodation providers would show flexibility to students in the current times, agreements between students and accommodation providers are a private matter, and neither I nor my Department have any remit to issue instructions in relation to the rental market.   </p></reply>

Even prior to this Act, our legislation on child pornography included images of a person generated or modified by computer-graphics.</p>  <p>  My Department has now completed a detailed review of compliance with the Convention. This review was carried out in consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other relevant stakeholders, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive, who have provided detailed information regarding the child protection, prevention and victim support aspects of the Convention, in order to establish Ireland's compliance with its operational elements. </p>  <p>  Following completion of this review and on foot of the advice of the Attorney General, I am pleased to confirm that Ireland is in a position to proceed toward ratification.

My Department is currently engaged in preparatory work for two sets of changes to the legislation.</p>  <p>  Firstly, my officials are considering a small number of requirements under the Personal Insolvency Acts which may be difficult or impracticable to comply with in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparation is well advanced and the intention is to bring forward a short urgent Bill for Government approval, in order to make any necessary amendments as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Secondly, my officials are already working to complete the major statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts, following the earlier public consultation already held, and now, in addition, to ensure that this review will also take full account of the latest developments and particularly, the significant economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>  <p>  I expect the review report to be finalised by the end of November, following further consultations with the Department of Finance, as required by s. 141 of the Acts, and with the Office of the Attorney General.  </p>  <p>  The Insolvency Acts 2012 to 2015 already provide for a number of mechanisms to help individuals who are unable to pay their debts by reason of insolvency, namely Debt Relief Notices, Debt Settlement Arrangements, and Personal Insolvency Arrangements (which apply to people with secured debts such as mortgages and unsecured debt) and the insolvency legislation and infrastructure has already been extensively reviewed and developed since 2012. </p>  <p>  Key reforms introduced include the section 115A court review process (which removed the so-called &lsquo;bank veto&rsquo;) enacted in 2015, interlocking reforms to bankruptcy legislation also enacted in 2015, and the introduction in 2016, and extension in 2019, of the Abhaile Mortgage Resolution Service, which in effect ensures that borrowers at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears can access free independent expert financial and legal advice and in certain cases legal aid.</p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving arising from, for example, service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and updated work practices. </p>  <p>  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.  Additional security checks can result in some applications taking longer than this average timescale. Such checks are fundamental to maintaining the legitimacy of the naturalisation process both nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  In addition, processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service Delivery of my Department. Sometimes the input of several government agencies, both within and without this jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. In other instances issues can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered before a final decision is taken.  </p>  <p>  Processing times have increased in the last number of years due to the introduction of increased checks, the impact of judicial challenges such as the Jones case in 2019, and the volume of applications received. </p>  <p>  If the applicant has a query in respect of their application, they can contact the Citizenship Division directly at citizenshipinfo@justice.ie.    </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The National Standards apply to the living conditions and services provided to residents within accommodation centres. They apply to all service providers contracted by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department to operate and manage accommodation and reception centres. </p>  <p>  The National Standards were developed through an Advisory Group that included representatives from Government Departments, state agencies, UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards will address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  These reforms aim to build on the improvements arising from recommendations in the McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the EU Recast Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013/33/EU) which we voluntarily opted into in June 2018. </p>  <p>  While my Department currently holds responsibility for the implementation of standards and reception conditions, this responsibility will transfer to my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration once the necessary secondary legislation is completed.</p>  <p>  A White Paper considering the totality of the international protection process, including the provision of accommodation, is due to be published by the end of this year. It will be a matter for Minister O&rsquo;Gorman to decide on how the National Standards will be implemented as part of this process. </p>  <p>  A Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence and Harassment is implemented in our accommodation centres, which includes safeguarding residents from harassment or violence based on their sexual orientation.</p>  <p>  IPAS staff are present at the International Protection Office when a person first applies for international protection. Should an applicant require accommodation or other services, IPAS determines the most suitable accommodation based on the needs of each individual or family group.  Where a person discloses their self-determined identity to IPAS, they are, in so far as is possible and practicable, assigned accommodation based on their needs. This determination may include the provision of shared accommodation with a partner who is also seeking accommodation or being accommodated within the Direct Provision system.  This would, of course, only apply where this information is disclosed.</p>  <p>  At any time during their stay in an accommodation centre, a resident has the option to request a transfer to a more suitable centre.  The policy of IPAS is to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of all residents. Staff working in accommodation centres receive regular training to equip them with the skills to support all residents.</p>  <p>  IPAS liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support.  In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI+.</p></reply>

A maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment is provided for in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.   </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that approximately 205 domestic dogs and/or pets were reported stolen to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019 and approximately 172 pets were reported stolen from January 2020 up to 26 August 2020. I am advised that these figures are approximate as they are based on descriptions given on the PULSE system.</p>  <p>  With regard to measures aimed at preventing such thefts, I am further informed that information has recently been disseminated to the Crime Prevention Officers Network countrywide specifically dealing with the topic of dog thefts. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety concurs with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe. Some of this information can be viewed online at https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/our-departments/office-of-corporate-communications/news-media/dog-theft-crime-prevention-advice.html   </p>  <p>  Ongoing patrols throughout the country also act as a deterrent to travelling criminals and thereby help prevent criminal activity. Improved awareness of dog thefts among the community will ensure more vigilance within neighbourhood watch and community alert areas.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have highlighted several successful seizures of dogs where the dogs were suspected to have been stolen. There was an arrest connected with the seizure of ten suspected stolen dogs in Co. Limerick on August 1, 2020.  Garda&iacute; have also seized 32 dogs near Swords that are believed to be stolen with an estimated value in excess of &euro;120,000. </p>  <p>  Officers of Customs and Excise (a division of the Revenue Commissioners), as well as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, have responsibility for searching vehicles at our ports of entry to deter ongoing criminal activity, including that of attempts to smuggle animals into and out of the State. Animals found without the necessary paperwork under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 are seized and handed into the care of the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or the relevant Local Authority as appropriate under Section 15 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986.</p></reply>

available capacity in our permanent centres, including as a result of increased social and physical distancing measures required in centres due to COVID-19. It is not my Department's policy to identify such temporary accommodation premises.</p><p>Of the 7,097 people being provided with accommodation by my Department, 810 people have an international protection status or a permission to remain in the State and therefore have the same access to housing supports and services as Irish and EEA nationals. Considerable work is being undertaken to support these residents to move out of accommodation centres and into secure permanent accommodation.  My Department has a specific team who work in collaboration with Depaul Ireland,  the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Peter McVerry Trust, officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association to collectively support these residents to access housing options. Between January and July of this year, 694 people have moved to accommodation in the community, of whom 508 received assistance from the support services outlined.</p></reply>

The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the DSS on 2 October 2017.  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.  The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.   </p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.</p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, to bring this matter forward. </p></reply>

This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the following link:</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand. This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, prioritises the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the four year implementation plan A Policing Service for the Future.  In its report, published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety.  The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. </p><p>A key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future is the rollout of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operating Model.  The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Future will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act.  My Department is progressing work on the preparation of a Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. </p><p>In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.  In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.</p></reply>

The offence was created in order to safeguard individuals who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable or at risk of abuse. Prosecution of the offence, which can result in a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years, is at the sole discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). </p>  <p>  The constitutionality of the legislation was upheld by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Fleming v Ireland and Others delivered on 29 April 2013. While acknowledging the very distressing situation of Ms. Fleming, the Court held that there is no constitutional right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one&rsquo;s life at a time of one&rsquo;s choosing. The Court also found that the prohibition on assisted suicide was not discriminatory and was not contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. As a consequence of the judgment, the offence of assisting another to take his or her life remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in June 2018, published a Report on the Right to Die with Dignity. The Committee made a number of recommendations, including that the Houses of the Oireachtas consider referring the issue to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly for deliberation. </p>  <p>  I understand that proposals in relation to this issue may come before the House shortly, and this would be an opportunity for Deputies to consider and debate this important and sensitive issue.</p></reply>

Within Community Engagement, Kevin Street, Community Policing Fora took place via online platforms on two occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  With regard to the north inner city, I understand that a Community Policing Forum (CPF) operated in the north inner city between 1999 and 2019, and that the Forum was funded through the Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force, but that that funding ceased in May 2019. A core element of the CPF operating model was that the community should have a role in identifying relevant issues and that an inter-agency approach should be adopted in resolving such issues. </p>  <p>  The recent Covid-19 crisis has shown how proactive and collaborative community engagement by community services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve the condition of peoples&rsquo; lives.  For example, since the onset of the Covid-19 restrictions, Garda&iacute; attached to Store Street Garda Station have increased engagement with the more vulnerable members of society in the North East Inner City area of Dublin, through volunteer services, service providers and on an individual basis.  </p>  <p>  Building on the experience of the CPF, and as part of the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, my Department is devising a policy on a whole-of-Government approach to community safety which aims to help foster local communities that are safer for families, residents and businesses and that feel more secure. </p>  <p>  As part of the policy, plans are being advanced to develop a North Inner City Community Safety Pilot which would encompass the North Inner City Electoral Area. The pilot will establish a Community Safety Partnership, which will serve to prioritise issues identified by the community as safety concerns and develop proper strategic partnership approaches to a range of local issues, integrating service providers in order to holistically address community concerns. </p>  <p>  Agencies and service providers across a range of areas will work with community representatives and Garda&iacute; on community solutions to complex safety problems. Community representation will be reinforced and a partnership approach will be fostered and supported. It will also aim to increase community confidence in service providers and identify elements to improve the delivery of a national programme on community safety.</p>  <p>  In addition, A Policing Service for our Future - the Government&rsquo;s plan to implement the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland - envisages a review of the Joint Policing Committee structure in the context of reimagining the approach to engagement with local communities on policing issues. The objective is for community representatives to be centrally involved in a partnership approach to community safety. In the meantime, the Joint Policing Committees provided for under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 continue to operate, including in Dublin.</p></reply>

Over 99% of travellers are permitted leave to land under various legal mechanisms including the EU Free Movement Directive, their relationships to Irish citizens, work permit schemes, study visas, or a lawful permission to be in the State already, to name a few examples. In a small minority of cases, a person may be refused leave to land for lawful reasons. In most of these cases the person is placed on a flight and returned to the location from which they departed on the same day. As such, it is often unnecessary to detain someone to facilitate their removal from the State when they are refused leave to land.</p><p>The numbers of persons refused leave to land by the Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department at Dublin Airport between 27 March 2020 and 8 September 2020 were as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Month</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>27/03/2020 &ndash; 31/03/2020</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>188</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>246</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01/09/2020 &ndash; 08/09/2020</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>586</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The BMU has responsibility for frontline immigration services at Dublin Airport only and other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p><p>Including the other ports of entry, a total of 719 persons were refused leave to land in the State between 27 March 2020 and 10 September 2020. This includes the Dublin Airport figures, which are set out in the table above.</p><p>It is not possible to provide a response in respect of the number of people that were subsequently detained and transferred to a prison or Garda station; the length of time they were detained; the breakdown of gender or where they were returned to. I am advised that the information is not readily available and would involve an extensive manual exercise to determine.</p><p>However, following a high profile case over the summer, my Department has conducted a full review of what occurred at that time and has improved or amended any procedural or administrative arrangements, including in relation to arrangements with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to avoid unnecessary immigration detention in such cases and to ensure that the Immigration Service can continually improve how it conducts its business, including data collection.</p><p>The management and opening of Garda Stations is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. However, given the importance of this facility in ensuring that we can fully implement our revised policies and procedures, I will be taking it up as a matter of urgency with the Commissioner.</p></reply>

A legal framework is being developed to protect the State's investment in the new NMH and to ensure that the hospital remains in State ownership.  This legal framework will also provide assurances that the new hospital will be operated without religious or other distinction. The new hospital will be built on a site leased from the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group (SVHG).  The State will provide an Operating Licence to the NMH DAC and the SVHG to facilitate the provision of health services in the new building. </p>  <p>  While the development of the legal framework has proved to be more difficult and more protracted than originally anticipated, I understand that there has been good engagement in recent weeks between my officials and the key stakeholders involved, namely the HSE, the NMH, and SVHG, and the drafting of the key documents is progressing well.  It should be noted that, once finalised, the legal framework will be brought to Government for approval.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am very conscious that the buildings at Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.  I believe  that we must move forward with the new NMH and provide the necessary infrastructure to enable the delivery of a modern, safe quality maternity service for women and infants.</p></reply>

This arises from the disease itself, as well as from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.</p><p>Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and services provided throughout the pandemic, although numbers have been reduced in some settings.</p><p>The advent of Covid-19 has led to a rapid acceleration in the delivery of online mental health services, with the Department of Health launching various initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing. </p><p>&euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psychosocial strategy. This will enable the Irish healthcare system to implement integrated telehealth solutions and to augment existing online interventions funded to date.</p><p>The HSE supports a wide array of mental health services nationwide, including support services for children, young people and their families, all of which are listed on YourMentalHealth.ie and Gov.ie. Working with the HSE, numerous state funded agencies have innovated, and adapted services to continue engaging with people during Covid-19, through online counselling, additional 24/7 telephone support, online training and tele-peer support. </p><p>Digital initiatives that have been recently introduced include:</p><p>- Free access to counselling online or by telephone for those affected by COVID-19.</p><p>- a national 24/7 Crisis Text-Line, a voluntary, clinically supported texting service targeting teenagers and young adults; and</p><p>- the new CAMHS Connect telepsychiatry service for HSE West which expected to be rolled out nationally and which will pave the way for enhanced care provision for children and young people, ranging from presentations in Emergency Departments to more regular monitoring after crisis episodes. CAMHS Connect will improve access, reduce waiting times and address some staff recruitment and retention issues. </p><p>To plan for the ongoing and increasing need for mental health services, and the demand for more holistic person-centred responses across the whole community, the refreshed national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision &ndash; A Mental Health Policy for Everyone, was published in June 2020. </p><p>This policy sets out a 10-year plan for our services that that addresses the needs of population though a focus on the requirements of the individual. </p><p>The key outcomes identified are:</p><p>- promotion, prevention and early intervention;</p><p>- service access, coordination and continuity of care;</p><p>- social inclusion; and</p><p>- accountability and continuous improvement.</p><p>Sharing the Vision will further promote the significant recent developments in online mental health service provision expedited by the advent of Covid-19.</p><p>There will be a national implementation monitoring committee (NIMC) to ensure the policy is driven nationally over the next ten years.</p><p>Planning for the establishment of the NIMC and associated implementation structures is underway and will be subject to ministerial approval in due course. It is anticipated that it will be established by October 2020.  </p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that, nonetheless, some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  However, it remains a matter of concern to me that a GMS and GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Therefore community pharmacists play a vital role in the Irish Health Service in the delivery of holistic patient care. I also fully acknowledge that community pharmacy has played a pivotal role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. It is recognised that community pharmacists have ensured the continued availability of a professional, accessible service for the public and have successfully managed to alleviate the worries and concerns of the population around continuity of medicine supply in the face of great uncertainty.</p>  <p>  This has been a period of unprecedented difficulty for the country and pharmacists have been at the forefront of the response. Accordingly, commitment has been given to commence a strategic review of the role of community pharmacists and to engage with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to develop revised contractual terms. On 5 December 2019, my predecessor met with the Irish Pharmacy Union and communicated this intention.</p>  <p>  The existing GMS pharmacy contract dates from 1996 and it is accepted that it is substantially outdated. It has not kept pace with developments that have taken place over the course of recent years including the increasing emphasis on maximising the proportion of people&rsquo;s healthcare needs met in primary care, interdisciplinary collaboration and the skillset that pharmacists have by virtue of their education and training.</p>  <p>  The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare. It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision including initiatives such as a Minor Ailment Scheme, and the delivery of a multi-disciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money. However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.</p></reply>

Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p><p>At the whole of Government level, the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021</i>sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the <i>Strategy</i>is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p><p>Under the<i>Strategy</i>,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p><p>Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following:</p><p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally<i></i>and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;</p><p>- The <i>Cost of Disability Study </i>currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p><p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy </i>by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that: - <i>'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-15a.1813.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091500080#WRGG03100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 672 and 673 together.</p><p>Ireland is committed to the WHO target of eliminating hepatitis C, including making it a rare disease by 2030. </p><p>The HSE established a National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme (NHCTP) in 2015 and began the process of providing treatment for Hepatitis C using Directly Acting Antivirals (DAA&rsquo;s) to patients prioritised according to clinical need. Since 2016, the HSE in its National Service Plans has committed to the continued implementation of a multi annual public health plan for the therapeutic treatment of hepatitis C. The NHCTP goal is to make hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland by 2026. In order to achieve this, the Programme is allocated funding of &euro;25m each year.</p><p>The programme continues to progress the extension of hepatitis C treatment away from the traditional based healthcare within a number of HSE Addiction Treatment Centres with the latest centres opened in the Thompson Centre, Grangegorman and the Tolco Clinic, Cabra in North Dublin.  Outcomes from these programmes are extremely positive with each patient engaging fully with their treatment and for those who have completed their treatment they have each received a sustained virological response i.e. a cure.</p><p>In tandem the programme is progressing the pilot of extending treatment availability within the community with treatment being provided by General Practitioners and corresponding oral substitution dispensing community pharmacists. Once proof of principle has been determined this project will be stepped up nationally.</p><p>In 2014 studies indicated that Ireland had a prevalence of 20,000-30,000.  It should be noted that this is an estimate of the prevalence and the true prevalence rate in Ireland is unknown. There is no general screening of the population to determine prevalence rates. To date a national sero-prevalence study has not been undertaken. However, the NHCTP has observed a marked decline in numbers of newly diagnosed infections in recent years and a significant increase in the numbers of patients successfully completing treatment.</p><p>It is estimated that at least 50-60% of the potential number of people in Ireland with Hepatitis C are not aware of their diagnosis and so therefore in order for the programme to achieve its aim of making hepatitis C a rare disease by 2026, focus needs to turn to identifying the population and case finding. Globally the availability of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAA) has shifted the focus towards elimination of HCV. The WHO has stated that national testing policies in addition to increased screening are essential so that the goal of elimination can be reached. In this regard, the National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme is commencing a communications campaign &lsquo;<b><i>Find the missing Millions&rsquo;</i></b>to promote the work of the NHCTP and to find the people who do not realise they are infected with Hepatitis C and offer them the treatment. The NHCTP is committed to treating as many people that are infected with Hepatitis C that are found, and as soon as they are identified.</p><p>The NCHTP is committed to evolving the changing needs in hepatitis C care for patients. A programme of work to refresh the National Hepatitis C Treatment Programme Strategy and Planning Document 2020-2026 is nearing completion. This will set a clear direction for the further expansion of the programme. </p><p>The NHCTP is also supported by a Programme Advisory Group who provide advice, support and strategic direction to the HSE of the successful development and implementation of the programme and a Clinical Advisory Group whose role is to provide clinical advice. </p><p>Since 2015 The NHCTP has provided treatment to over 5,500 people in Ireland using DAA Medication with cure rates in excess of 95%. The goal of making Hepatitis C a rare disease in Ireland is a reality since the availability of transformative therapeutic drug regimens to successfully treat and cure people with Hepatitis C. </p><p>To ensure we reach our goal of Hepatitis C becoming a rare disease in Ireland by 2026 the programme will:</p><p>- Continue treatment using DAA&rsquo;s which have a significantly higher rate of patients achieving Sustained Virological Response or cure. </p><p>- Increase numbers of patients being treated to achieve &amp;gt; 60% reduction in liver related deaths &amp;amp; 90% reductions in total and new infections &ndash; actively &lsquo;<i>Seek and Treat&rsquo; </i>harder to reach client groups in collaboration with Addiction services</p><p>- Expand screening programmes to identify all infected patients</p><p>- Expand treatment criteria to treat all infected patients &ndash; i.e. treatment as prevention and treatment to elimination. </p><p>- Promote the awareness of Hepatitis C and the need to get tested and treated</p><p>- Progression of the Community G.P/Pharmacy Dispensing Pilot</p><p>- Conduct an epidemiology study to determine the prevalence of Hepatitis C in Ireland to inform the efforts of the programme</p><p>With the outbreak of COVID-19 Hepatitis C clinics were significantly impacted. However, clinics are returning to normal and the NHCTP is confident that the programme is on target to eliminate Hepatitis C in Ireland by 2026.</p></reply>

This guidance seeks to provide an advisory framework for mitigating risks associated with the delivery of non-COVID care while COVID-19 continues to be prevalent, and testing provides one of a number of measures that can be taken to reduce risk. </p>  <p>  As with any procedure or test, there will be a cost. I am not in a position to comment on what the actual cost may be in private hospitals, however, I understand that the costs arising from testing for COVID-19 in public hospitals is much lower than the charge quoted by the Deputy. As you will be aware, public patients are not charged for Covid tests in public hospitals.</p>  <p>  In addition, I can confirm that the NTPF have advised my Department that no patient is liable for any charge from a private hospital for services arranged by the NTPF. It is also my understanding that the three main health insurers have reached agreement with the majority of private hospital facilities regarding charges for pre-admission COVID-19 testing, while continuing to work with those providers who they have not yet finalised agreements with.

The primary function of the list is to ensure that appropriate public health measures apply to international arrivals. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that it is the Government rather than the Department of Health that makes decisions relating to travel. The Department of Health provides data to Government on an ongoing basis to assist their decision-making on travel advisories. The Government decided on August 18th 2020 that there would be no change to the current travel advisory. This is subject to ongoing review and the evolving national and international situation is taken into account when considering these matters.</p>  <p>   Given the nature of this disease and the variability of incidence rates, the Government keeps the 'green list' under review.</p></reply>

This letter reminded practitioners that these preparations had not been assessed by the NDAB and their use as a means of pregnancy testing had not been accepted by the NDAB. The letter also highlighted that these preparations should be avoided, as a firm statement of safety could not be given and other, more efficient, methods of pregnancy testing were available. This correspondence and information was also highlighted in the NDAB Annual Report for 1975.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has not undertaken any research into the historical use of Duogynon.</p></reply>

The heath service is working to improve how information on medications is communicated safely as patient transition between care settings.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>-   Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs were considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly. </p>  <p>  The NTPF has now completed its report and the Steering Group has completed its consideration of it, the report has been submitted by the NTPF to the Department. An examination of this review by my Department has also taken place. Any recommendations included in the report will be appraised before publication.</p>  <p>  However, further progress on this work has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person.</p>  <p>  Success in detecting Covid-19 is affected by the timing of sampling, the type and quality of the sample and the test used to analyse the sample. it is well recognised that no single test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific. Extensive validations have been carried out in our laboratories, with national collation of data, to ensure that the tests used show high sensitivity.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.</p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland is fortunate to have fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas, including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life. </p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.</p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.</p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.</p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.</p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and well-being, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psycho-social strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for front line workers from Turn2me.</p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.</p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of Sharing the Vision. This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.</p></reply>

Fever (greater than or equal to 38.0&deg;C; confirmed) in the absence of an alternative diagnosis (e.g. UTI, varicella) OR </p><p>2. A new cough, shortness of breath or deterioration in existing respiratory condition OR</p><p>3.

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8th July 2020. </p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p>  <p>  Day services began to gradually resume during the month of August and will continue to do so throughout early September. Service providers are working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link.  </p>  <p>  An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is now available. Service users and families can access this information on www.hse.ie/newdirections </p></reply>

The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. With an annual budget of approximately &euro;45 million, and management of an investment portfolio of approximately &euro;200m, the HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials, health services research, population health research, as well as managing a number of national health information systems on behalf of the Department. Furthermore, my Department provides funding for, and participates in, a multi annual Joint Research Programme in Healthcare Reform with the Economic and Social Research Institute, as well as the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). </p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HRB, as well as the aforementioned established research programmes, have incorporated COVID -19 related research into their work programmes and have already played an important role (among other agencies and the wider academic community) in providing research inputs to the various sub-groups of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Therefore, increased research in this area is being funded through existing allocations. Increasing allocation of funding to account for the requirements for increased COVID - 19 research is currently being determined as part of the budget 2021 process.     </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.</p>  <p>  HIQA monitors compliance with nationally-mandated standards and regulations to ensure that older people are receiving safe, high-quality and person-centred care. HIQA takes a risk-based approach to inspection and when information is received to suggest that there is a risk to the wellbeing of residents, HIQA uses this information to decide which regulations will be inspected against. Registered providers are required to be compliant with regulation 27 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013  on infection control.  HIQA also monitors compliance against the National Standards for infection prevention and control in community services, developed and put in place since 2018. </p>  <p>  HIQA inspections can take place over one or two days, with the duration influenced by factors such as the:          </p>  <p>-   COVID-19 status of the centre</p>  <p>  - reason for the inspection</p>  <p>  - number of inspectors on inspection</p>  <p>  - size of the centre</p>  <p>  - findings during the course of the inspection. </p>  <p>  Inspections progress rapidly in centres where residents are well cared for, the findings are good, and the provider is organised and the required documentation is readily available for review.</p>  <p>  On foot of a National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendation, on 23rd May, a COVID-19 Expert Panel on Nursing Homes was established to examine emerging best practice and recommendations to ensure that all protective COVID-19 public health and other measures to safeguard nursing home residents are planned and in place to respond to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the next 6-18 months.  On 19 August the COVID-19 Nursing Home Expert Panel&rsquo;s report was published.  The report contains 86 recommendations across 15 thematic areas including in relation to  infection prevention and control.  </p>  <p>  Given the urgency associated with the ongoing protection of nursing home residents, the need to evolve preparedness plans and to be &ldquo;winter ready&rdquo;, a robust implementation framework is being established.  An inter-agency Implementation Oversight Team to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report, to provide regular updates on the progress of implementation of recommendations, identify and mitigate any barriers to implementation and to report to the Minister for Health on an ongoing basis. The Oversight Team is chaired by the Department of Health and has met twice since its establishment. A Reference Group to facilitate ongoing early engagement and involvement in the implementation process with relevant national stakeholders is also being established. This Group will also meet later this month.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that all measures required to prevent and manage an expected resurgence of COVID-19 continues to be a priority.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

The HSE has worked intensively since the start of the pandemic to put this in place and I would again like to acknowledge the huge work undertaken in this regard across the HSE.</p>  <p>  Capacity has been in place since early summer to test 15,000 people a day/100,000 people per week. The testing and contact tracing operational and resource model has been designed to flex up and down as needed.  In recent weeks we have needed to flex it up significantly as demand has increased. We are testing more people than ever before, with almost 70,000 tests completed in the week ending 7th September. The HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this level of demand, including the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing. </p>  <p>  We had seen improvements in turnaround times over the week ending 7th September. 85% of GP referrals received an appointment the same day or the next day - the median being 0.9 days. The median time from swab to lab result was 29 hours. In total, the median end-to-end turnaround time for negative tests in the community setting ranged from 2.0-2.1 days while median end-to-end turnaround time from referral to communication of a positive result was 2.3-2.8 days. I do acknowledge that the system has come under strain in recent weeks, with a very significant increase in demand experience last week which resulted in some delays. There was a record of 13,000 referrals to community testing on Monday alone, and demand remained high for the week. As outlined above, additional capacity has been brought on stream quickly to meet this demand. </p>  <p>  It is critical that parents continue to contact their GP if their child has any of the symptoms of COVID-19. The impact that the requirement to restrict movements has while waiting for a test and a test result is understood. But it is essential to prevent any further transmission of the virus, protecting other children and teachers in school and the community more generally.</p>  <p>  More generally, the HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out over the coming weeks to ensure that people can access a test quickly and get their result quickly. Transition to the new model is underway and will continue through the Autumn.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.</p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland is fortunate to have fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas, including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life. </p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of A Vision for Change and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.</p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.</p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.</p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional. The Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant stress, anxiety, worry and fear for many people throughout the world, from the disease itself and from impacts such as increased social isolation, disruption to daily life and uncertainty about employment and financial security.</p>  <p>  The HSE has continued to provide all community services, as far as possible, while following Covid-19 guidelines to ensure protection for patients and staff. Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and well-being, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psycho-social strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for front line workers from Turn2me. </p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020. </p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.</p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of Sharing the Vision. This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>On 18 August, 2020 the Government introduced a number of enhanced public health measures in response to an increase in the number of cases in the previous weeks, with multiple outbreaks across workplaces, households, and in sports clubs. Internationally we have also seen a significant acceleration in the spread of COVID-19. </p><p>The measures introduced were required to protect the vulnerable in our communities, enable schools to reopen and support the resumption of health services. </p><p>As part of the measures announced, limits on mass gatherings were reintroduced. However, weddings are exempt from these limits and can be held with up to 50 people in attendance including staff working at the venue. The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 4) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 326 of 2020) provides the legal basis for this exemption.

At this time, walk-in clinics are not generally being provided and patients are asked to phone their GP initially to discuss their medical problem. GPs are performing assessments over the phone to determine if a patient needs to attend the surgery. Where clinically indicated, the GP will arrange an appointment to see the patient in the surgery.  These measures are necessary to ensure the safety of patients, GPs, and practice staff.</p>  <p>  Each GP practice must have regard to its own circumstances and facilities. It is necessary to balance the safety of patients and staff and the needs of individual patients. The decision on what services can be provided and what can be done face to face will depend on each practice&rsquo;s location, availability of personal protective equipment, resources available to conduct virtual visits and the patient and staff profile of the practice.</p></reply>

This is a generic policy framework for rare diseases. The scope of the plan is broad given that there are approximately 8,000 rare diseases affecting millions of EU citizens; and consequently, there can be a dearth of expertise and knowledge about some rare diseases, simply because they are so rare. </p>  <p>  Many of the major recommendations of the plan have already been implemented and in December 2013 the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established as a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. A Clinical Advisory Group was established to oversee the programme, a Clinical Lead and Programme Manager were appointed, and a multidisciplinary National Working Group was established to provide support to the programme workstreams and the National Plan was firmly embedded in the Programme.   </p>  <p>  The opening of the National Rare Disease Office, (NRDO) in 2015 was a significant milestone for people living with a rare disease, their families and their healthcare professionals.  Prof Eileen Treacy is the Director of the National Rare Diseases Office, whose purpose it is to provide current and reliable information about genetic and rare diseases to patients, families and healthcare professionals.    </p>  <p>  On foot of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer&rsquo;s (CCO), review of all the national clinical programmes in April 2019, it was recommended that the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases be operationalised and incorporated into the National Rare Disease Office. From 01 September 2020, the NRDO will be the main contact point and driver for national HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. The work of the NRDO will be overseen and governed by HSE Acute Operations.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan.    </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.   </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.   </p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.    </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Details of services operating during the coronavirus outbreak can be found at . </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team  and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. </p><p>The Government introduced new regulations for indoor events on 31st August, 2020 [(S.I. 326 of 2020) Health Act 1947 (Section 31a &ndash; Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 4) Regulations 2020].

Capacity will depend on the venue and the ability to physically distance and ensure other protective measures are in place, the overall numbers at any one time within the meeting facility should not exceed 50 people.</p><p>- To ensure optimal physical distancing, multiple pods of a maximum of 6 people in each is preferable if sufficient space is available and if it is feasible, with no inter-mingling between pods. </p><p>I welcome the clarification that addiction support groups are not covered by the regulations governing indoor events. I would advise that support groups proceed with a degree of extra caution, as individuals with addiction problems can be more vulnerable to the risk of Covid-19 due to underlying health conditions, and put in place strict protective measures. </p></reply>

ME is sometimes known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).</p>  <p>  There is currently no known, specific, medical diagnostic test to determine or confirm a correct diagnosis of ME and no specific treatment which works for all sufferers is currently available. As a result clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. There are assessments and tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner. Specialised tests may be required when considering and ruling out other diagnoses. Relevant specialists are usually accessed through out patient clinics at secondary care level. The General Practitioner is regarded as best placed to refer patients, if appropriate.</p>  <p>  Treatment for ME is tailored to address the varying symptoms presented by those affected by ME. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. Different patients, depending on their primary symptoms, will require different Consultant input. The challenge in relation to ME is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients frequently attending different Consultants for management of their symptoms as and when they arise. Consultants are well used to coordinating the care of patients that require the input of their colleagues and other members of the multidisciplinary care team.</p>  <p>  Work is under way as part of the implementation of the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020, specifically as regards addressing how and where the patient is treated and the classification of referrals with corresponding clinically recommended time-frames. Consideration is also being given to condition specific referral forms. This work should see significant improvements with respect to access to appropriate services.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant and Home Support Services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. </p>  <p>   PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers. </p>  <p>   Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.  Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available.  As with every service there is not a limitless resource available for the provision of home support services and while the resources available are substantial they are finite.  In this context, services are discretionary and the number of hours granted is determined by other support services already provided to the person/family.</p></reply>

This is available to patients travelling to a designated cancer centre, approved centres, or an approved children&rsquo;s hospital and will cover part of the associated costs for said travel. Application for financial assistance from the fund requires that the patient meet the following criteria:</p><p>- Permanent residence in the state,</p><p>- Travelling over 50km to their designated cancer centre, approved centres, or approved children&rsquo;s hospital,</p><p>- A genuine financial need for assistance,</p><p>- No qualification for other schemes, such as transport funded by the HSE or voluntary services such as the Volunteer Driver Service (however, it is possible for a child to receive assistance from both the Irish Cancer Society&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Fund and the Travel 2 Care scheme simultaneously).</p><p>Application is conducted using two separate forms depending on the treatment being travelled for. In the case of cancer tests, application can be made by submitting Form A to the Irish Cancer Society - which is available via cancer.ie, emailing travel@irishcancer.ie, calling 01 231 6643 / 01 231 0522 to request a copy, or by requesting a copy via the mail. </p><p>Form B is for ongoing treatment &ndash; such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or palliative care &ndash; and is only available from a healthcare professional such as a medical social worker or your G.P. Said healthcare professional is not obligated to provide the application form and must believe there is genuine need for financial assistance to provide it.</p><p>The following hospitals are covered by the Travel2Care scheme:</p><p>- Beaumont Hospital</p><p>- Mater Misericordiae University Hospital</p><p>- St James&rsquo;s Hospital</p><p>- St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital</p><p>- Cork University Hospital</p><p>- University Hospital Waterford</p><p>- Galway University Hospital</p><p>- University Hospital Limerick</p><p>- Letterkenny General Hospital (approved satellite centre)</p><p>- Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin</p><p>- St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital</p><p>- Whitfield Clinic (if you are a public patient travelling over 50kms for radiotherapy treatment)</p><p>- Altnagelvin Area Hospital</p><p>The second scheme available aiding those travelling for cancer treatment is the Volunteer Driver Service. This is a volunteer delivered transport service wherein patients are driven to and from treatment in designated partner hospitals and centres. Drivers are interviewed, trained, Garda vetted and must attend annual Support and Supervision sessions ran by the Irish Cancer Society to participate in the service.</p><p>The service is free to the patient, with all costs paid by the Irish Cancer Society, and applications are conducted by approaching a healthcare professional in a partnered hospital who will then discuss the suitability of it for the patients needs and make a decision on referral. Once referred, the patient must book appointments in advance with the Irish Cancer Society to arrange transport.</p><p>Participating hospitals and cancer centres for the scheme are:</p><p>- Cavan General Hospital</p><p>- Cork University Hospital</p><p>- The Mercy Hospital</p><p>- South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</p><p>- Beaumont Hospital</p><p>- St. Vincent's University Hospital</p><p>- St. James' Hospital</p><p>- Mater Misericordiae University Hospital</p><p>- Tallaght University Hospital</p><p>- Connolly Hospital</p><p>- Letterkenny General Hospital</p><p>- Merlin Park University Hospital</p><p>- Galway University Hospital </p><p>- Portiuncula Hospital</p><p>- Kerry General Hospital</p><p>- Naas Hospital</p><p>- St. Luke's General Hospital</p><p>- University Hospital Limerick</p><p>- Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital</p><p>- Mayo General Hospital</p><p>- Midlands Regional Hospital</p><p>- Sligo General Hospital</p><p>- South Tipperary General Hospital</p><p>- University Hospital Waterford</p><p>- Wexford General Hospital</p><p>- Donegal Cancer Flights &amp;amp; Services, Ionad Naomh P&aacute;draig, Upper Dore, Bunbeg, Letterkenny, Donegal</p><p>- The Community Intervention Team , Anam Cara, St Canice&rsquo;s Road, Glasnevin, Dublin 11 (Outreach centre for The Mater and Beaumont Hospital)</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals were treated as public patients and their treatment was prioritised based on clinical need. </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities to support capacity requirements. A procurement process is currently in train to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address capacity needs over the next two years. </p>  <p>The HSE is also undertaking bilateral discussions with individual private hospitals to seek to agree new arrangements which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases.  </p></reply>

This is about living ordinary lives in ordinary places, as independently as possible, while ensuring that the voices of service users and their families are heard, and that they are fully involved in planning and improving services to meet their needs.   </p>  <p>  The majority of people with a disability live in their family home, with a proportion of people in receipt of specialist disability services residing in long term residential care facilities. Those living in the family home or their own home are supported through a range of service provision, including adult day services, personal assistance and home support Hours and respite services. Supports are provided by the HSE either directly or through partner organisations, prioritised according to need and within the resources available.  </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy currently lies with the Department of Justice and Equality, and that function is in the process of transferring to the come under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Department of Justice and Equality is seeking to develop a consultation and participation model within the context of the Strategy in line with the obligations that arise under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD),in partnership with relevant stakeholders. A key part of this will be to increase capacity for consultation with people with disabilities and establish improved mechanisms and support to enable these consultations.  </p>  <p>  Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in March 2018. The Convention imposes obligations on the State to ensure effective consultation with and participation by persons with Disabilities. Specifically Articles 4 and 5 require States Parties to &lsquo;closely consult and actively involve persons with disabilities, including children with disabilities&rsquo; in the development and implementation of legislation and policies concerning persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is an international treaty that establishes two procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention.  The first is an individual communications procedure allowing individuals to bring petitions to the Committee claiming breaches of their rights; the second is an inquiry procedure giving the Committee authority to undertake inquiries of grave or systematic violations of the Convention.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reiterates the commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol after the first reporting cycle. The Government priorities remain focused on addressing the remaining legislative measures to be taken to give full effect to the Convention. </p>  <p>  Other priorities are the submission of the CRPD Initial State Report and developing an implementation plan to coordinate implementation of the UNCRPD.</p></reply>

In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. Scoliosis activity accounts for 20% of overall orthopaedic activity across CHI. </p>  <p>  This funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTE in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services including scoliosis services. The posts relate to the multi-disciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre, and post operatively. The majority of posts were allocated to each hospital in 2018.</p>  <p>  The 2018 investment in paediatric orthopaedics included funding to support transition of adolescents with scoliosis from CHI at Crumlin to the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH). CHI and MMUH have developed and agreed the clinical pathways for the transition of adolescents with scoliosis to MMUH. The transition of patients over the age of 16 who were awaiting a first-time outpatient/spinal review appointment at Crumlin commenced in December 2018. Each month, appropriate patients are identified for this pathway via clinical validation. </p>  <p>  CHI have advised my Department that the introduction of government restrictions for COVID-19 based on public health advice required CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street to defer all non-emergency spinal operations. CHI at Crumlin and Temple Street have now resumed services on an incremental basis.</p>  <p>  Key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) requirements have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver services, significantly impacting on the overall capacity and operational activity levels for inpatient / outpatient settings. To the end of August 2020, 177 scoliosis procedures had taken place, compared to 251 for the same period last year, marking a decrease in activity of 29%.</p>  <p>  At the end of August 2020 there were 218 scoliosis patients waiting for a spinal procedure at Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh Hospitals, across active, TCI (to come in) suspended and planned procedure categories. Of this number, 129 were awaiting spinal fusion procedures, while 89 were awaiting other spinal procedures.</p>  <p>  Additional initiatives are being explored to increase access to scoliosis treatment - CHI is working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh to transfer additional patients who meet the clinical criteria for treatment at Cappagh and in conjunction with the NTPF, sourcing additional theatre space.  </p>  <p>  Scoliosis services, waiting lists, and activity levels are specifically monitored by the Scheduled Care Performance Unit in my Department, through weekly performance monitoring meetings which are attended by representatives from CHI, and through continued engagement between Department and HSE officials.</p></reply>

However, they do collect Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that measure time to treatment for radiation and medical oncology.</p><p>It is important to note that 2020 data is indicative data that has not yet been fully verified, as such 2020 data may be subject to change once all data has been verified. Indicative data for the year-to-date shows a similar performance to full-year data for 2019: <table>    <tr>       <th>Clinical Programme</th>       <th>Key Performance Indicator</th>       <th>2019 (FY)</th>       <th>2020 (YTD)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Radiation Oncology</td>       <td>90% of patients completing radical radiation therapy commenced treatment within 15 working days of being deemed ready to treat</td>       <td>85.30%</td>       <td>87.40%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Oncology</td>       <td>90% of patients receiving new systemic parenteral treatment in the day ward   setting commenced treatment within 15 days working days of being deemed ready   to treat</td>       <td>89.80%</td>       <td>90.40%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>All KPIs are based on internationally benchmarked clinical standards. Targets are set high enough that they are difficult for each cancer centre to achieve whilst also considering anticipated clinical volumes that may confound or delay treatment for more complex patients. Targets are therefore indicative of a high performing unit and missing a target is not necessarily an indication of sub-standard performance.</p><p>Data on surgical waiting times is more retrospective. Current data on surgical wait times across the surgical cancer centres indicates:</p><p><b>Breast (within 20 days)</b></p><p>- 2019 (full year): 76.3% </p><p>- 2020 (Q1): 75.6%</p><p><b>Lung (within 30 days)</b></p><p>- 2019 (full year): 55.3% </p><p>- 2020 (Q1 - only 1 of 4 hospitals returned data): 65.0%</p><p><b>Prostate (within 30 days)</b></p><p>- 2019 (full year): 32.7%</p><p>- 2020: data not yet due</p><p><b>Pancreas (within 20 days)</b></p><p>- 2019 (full year): 69.6%</p><p>- 2020: data not yet due </p><p>Plans for the resumption of cancer services are underway in my Department and the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme as part of the Winter Plan and in the context of the 2021 Estimates.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organization, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-Covid care including more routine care and services have resumed in line with NPHET recommendations.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  The HSE is seeking to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as telemedicine and the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that in order to continue to provide access for patients there has been considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations for many specialties across the system. While figures for August are not yet available, the HSE advise that a total of 73,198 virtual outpatient consultations took place in July. This represents 27% of the overall OPD activity for July (266,349).</p>  <p>  The number of patients awaiting an Inpatient or Day Case (IPDC) procedure decreased by 2,663 (-3%) at the end of August when compared to the end of July waiting list. While year to date the IPDC waiting list has grown by 17% (up 11,057 since end December 2019), the number of patients actively waiting has continued to fall since May. Part of the reason for the decrease in the numbers waiting is an increase in the number of patients being moved on to the TCI list (To Come In). The consistent increase in the number of patients on the TCI list since April is indicative of increased elective activity, and results in the removal of patients from the active IPDC waiting list. </p>  <p>  The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time critical procedures. A procurement process is currently in train to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address capacity needs over the next two years.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has recommenced arranging treatment for patients in both private and public hospitals. At the end of August, 19,218 IPDC treatments had been arranged. The NTPF had also arranged 4,604 G.I. Scopes. In terms of Outpatients, the NTPF had approved in principal 66,096 Outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The NTPF is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.</p></reply>

For acute hospitals to function optimally, services at primary care, in the community and services such as home help and nursing home support must also work well.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy 2018 identified a range of challenges for the public health system. </p>  <p>  In addition, the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review identified a requirement for an increase of 2,590 acute hospitals beds by 2031, in a health system reform scenario, to support the projected increase in demand for services in the years ahead.  </p>  <p>  A Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation office has been created in the department to drive the Sl&aacute;intecare Reform programme, and I can confirm that the National Development Plan provides for the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  The COVID 19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented interruption to normal healthcare activity, with both community and acute settings affected. Resuming health and social care services and building our capacity and capability for the pressures of winter 2020/21 and beyond will be particularly challenging in a way that the health service has not experienced in living memory.</p>  <p>  In response, the HSE has developed a single overarching plan to set out how it will resume and deliver services (Planning for Health Services Delivery in the Covid-19 Pandemic) in the period to 2021. This overarching plan essentially includes the normal winter plan that would incorporate enhancement to services to cope with winter pressures, but also takes a more strategic approach by considering actions necessary to resume services paused, return reduced services to normal activity and build capacity such that the system can deal with expected demand and pressures to the end of 2021. The intention is that the plan, and the associated investment required, will be considered in the context of the 2021 Estimates process.  In the meantime, and recognising the need to immediately commence those initiatives which will have an impact over the coming winter, the Department and HSE intend to publish a Winter Plan, which will be a subset of the overarching plan. The HSE has identified and prioritised a number of actions to a total limit of &euro;600m to form the basis of this Winter Plan.</p></reply>

In anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system a major part of the response was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.  A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. Following negotiations with the Private Hospitals Association an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March. Under the agreement, the HSE secured 100% of the capacity of the private hospitals until the end of June.  </p>  <p>  Following termination of the agreement the Government mandated the HSE to seek an agreement with the private hospitals on a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases, and separately with ongoing agreed access, in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), to private hospital services to address the HSE&rsquo;s priority needs in providing both essential care and addressing elective care for public patients experiencing delays. The HSE is undertaking bilateral discussions with individual private hospitals to seek to agree new arrangements which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 cases. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work to ensure that capacity exists within the health service to meet the needs of patients during this unique and challenging time. Future planning remains a critical priority for me and my Department. </p>  <p>  As part of the Winter and Service Planning process, the HSE is undertaking a strategic approach to service resumption. This includes the development of a longer-term plan to include augmented levels of service to regain a level of provision across community and acute hospitals where capacity was adversely impacted by COVID 19.  </p>  <p>  The immediate priority for the HSE is the finalisation of a Winter Plan which incorporates the enhancement of services to cope with Winter pressures into early 2021 to ensure the capacity and capability of the health system is prepared for this challenging period. The various initiatives proposed in the plan are designed to reduce attendances and admissions, and improve capacity and throughput in hospitals. </p>  <p>  In terms of Service Planning, a range of initiatives have been developed by the HSE, which will support service resumption and increased capacity across the Community and Acute hospital systems, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months. This includes establishing key community services envisioned in Sl&aacute;intecare and the 2018 Capacity Review, while building toward the appropriate level of capacity in our acute hospital services. </p>  <p>  The HSE is also currently working to secure access to private hospital facilities for urgent and time critical procedures. A procurement process is currently in train to secure access to additional acute services and diagnostic capacity from private providers which is required to address capacity needs over the next two year. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also resumed its operations with regard to procuring services to address waiting lists.</p></reply>

The NPHDB continues to engage with the contractor and is monitoring progress on site in the interests of completing the project as quickly and economically as possible. </p>  <p>  On that note I want to say that I am acutely aware of how urgently the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital is needed and I want to see it delivered as quickly as possible on behalf of children, young people and their families. </p>  <p>  The NPHDB is continuing to engage with the Main Contractor to obtain an updated programme of works that is in line with its contractual commitments. Any delivery outside of the timelines agreed under the contract could potentially be a matter for dispute resolution and so I wish to be careful in respect of what I say here, but I will reiterate that it is a priority for me and this Government that the hospital be completed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The overall project cost advised to the previous Government in December 2018 is &euro;1.73 billion. That figure comprises &euro;1.43 billion which is the overall cost to complete the capital project, and also includes a broader programme of activity associated with the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites under development. This includes for example investment in ICT, an Electronic Health Record system and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme - the merging of three paediatric hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The PwC report makes clear that the Guaranteed Maximum Price established through the two-stage tender process does not provide a contractual ceiling on cost and significant residual risks remain of further cost.  The residual risks, for which there cannot be cost certainty, include items such as construction inflation, claims and certain uncontrollable risks, such as potential costs relating to BREXIT.  I am advised that the main contractor has submitted a significant number of claims which it alleges are outside of the agreed scope.  The NPHDB has a robust process in place for the assessment of claims by the Contractor in accordance with the Construction Contract. This process is a commercially sensitive one between the contractor and the NPHDB.   </p>  <p>  The NPHDB have statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital.  I have referred the remaining part of your question to the NPHDB for direct reply.</p></reply>

The HSE has worked intensively since the start of the pandemic to put this in place and I would again like to acknowledge the huge work undertaken in this regard across the HSE.</p>  <p>  Capacity has been in place since early summer to test 15,000 people a day/100,000 people per week.  Rigorous contact tracing, automatic testing of close contacts, serial testing in high risk environments and large-scale testing in outbreak situations means we are proactively finding more cases than we would have previously. </p>  <p>  The testing and contact tracing operational and resource model has been designed to flex up and down as needed.  In recent weeks we have needed to flex it up significantly as demand has increased. We are testing more people than ever before, with almost 70,000 tests completed in the week ending 7th September. The HSE has deployed additional resources to meet this level of demand, including the opening of additional community testing centres and mobile pop-up testing units, significantly increased contact tracing teams and increased laboratory testing. </p>  <p>  Ireland is pursuing a robust testing strategy under the guidance of NPHET and NPHET will continue to consider and review, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing at populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. This includes testing of close contacts, and serial testing in nursing homes and food processing facilities.</p>  <p>  That is not to say that we can&rsquo;t improve further. The HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce which has already commenced, and a range of other service improvements which will be rolled out quickly. Transition to the new model is underway and will continue through the Autumn.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is now finalising a future service model for testing and tracing. This enhanced operational model is in the final stages of design with implementation underway for priority areas such as workforce recruitment and the test centre estate. This service model will aim to deliver a patient-centred service, accessible, consistent and flexible service.  This plan includes the recruitment of a permanent workforce in addition to leveraging the clinical and operational expertise embedded in our community services and this work has already commenced.</p>  <p>  The operating model will take into account the evolving needs and future potential service demands in the context of Covid-19 surges in disease transmission. Transition to the new model is underway and will continue through the Autumn.</p></reply>

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to access for patients waiting for high volume procedures including cataracts. At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. At the end of August 2020, there were 5,110 patients waiting for a cataract procedure. Of these, 1,219 are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 72% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,371 waiting over 9 months.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. </p>  <p>  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-urgent health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on its website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-COVID 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has recommenced arranging treatment for patients in both private and public hospitals, for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists. A number of high-volume procedures, including cataract surgery, are being commissioned as part of the NTPF procurement process.</p></reply>

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.   </p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. A majority of my Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.  </p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritises files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.   </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided. </p>  <p>  There is a commitment under the Programme for Government to review the forestry appeals process to ensure that it is aligned with other comparable appeals processes. That is why a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced.  The public consultation period for the draft Bill recently closed, with almost 9,000 submissions received.  These submissions will inform the updated version of the Bill  which will  be presented to the Oireachtas.  The introduction of these amendments will be accompanied by an on-line portal on which forestry licence applications and site details will be easily accessible to any interested party. </p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

This is a new Reserve, and the particulars of how it will be distributed will be agreed after the Commission has presented its proposal for the Reserve by November 2020. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the disproportionate impact Brexit will have on Ireland, and especially on the Irish agrifood sector. We exported more than &euro;1 billion worth of beef, and more than &euro;1 billion of dairy products, to the UK in 2019. Based  on the tariff schedule currently published by the UK, the tariffs that would be imposed on that trade on 1 January 2021 if there is no FTA agreed between the EU and the UK, and the customs and regulatory costs that will apply, whether there is an FTA or not, will have a significant impact on that trade.  </p>  <p>  My Department has ensured that financial and budgetary measures have been put in place to help the agri-food and fisheries sectors to deal with the Brexit challenges they have faced to date. These measures were also aimed at enhancing competitiveness, and market and product diversification. The Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan makes it clear that further measures to support businesses and affected sectors will be considered in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Adjustment Reserve will be an important additional support for those adjusting to the new reality of trading with the UK as a third country. Every effort will be made to ensure that the agrifood sector gets an allocation from this Reserve that is commensurate with the impact on the sector.</p></reply>

They are in addition to general animal health and welfare legislative requirement, as well as in the case of dogs, controls under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, where applicable.   </p>  <p>  My Department takes an active role in the issue of the welfare of pets being sold and supplied at the European level, as a member of a group of a number of EU Member States and animal welfare charities established to consider issues relating to the pet trade. The Department participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group formed in 2015 by a number of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and classified advertising websites to address irresponsible advertising of pets online.  Officials of my Department have engaged with and will continue to engage constructively with members of IPAAG, on the issue of online advertising and enforcement of the new Regulations.  </p>  <p>  The Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 set out requirements in relation to the microchipping of dogs, and registration of chips with dog identification databases.  The Regulations may be enforced by any authorised officer under that Act.  This includes officers of my Department, An Garda Sioch&aacute;na, dog wardens, members of the local authority veterinary service, Customs agents and officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA.</p></reply>

It provides funding of &euro;300 million over the six year programme and addresses widely acknowledged weaknesses in the maternal genetics of the Irish suckler herd, makes a positive contribution to farmer profitability and reduces the greenhouse gas intensity of Ireland&rsquo;s beef production. </p><p>BDGP provides for annual payments to participating farmers for completion of defined actions as set out in the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. For 2020, a key requirement in BDGP I is for participating farmers to ensure that at least 50% of their reference animals are heifers/eligible suckler cows that are rated at 4/5 stars on the replacement index. Under BDGP II, which started in 2017, the requirement for replacement heifers is 20% of their reference animals.</p><p>Since 2017, ICBF has been posting &ldquo;BDGP Eligibility&rdquo; reports to participating herds after each genetic evaluation run to give herd owners an up to date picture of where their herds stood in relation to programme targets. Targeted letters were included with these reports which explained exactly what participating herds had to do and explained options for herds that were not on course to meet certain targets. These reports and letters continue to be posted after each evaluation.</p><p>ICBF has also been specifically targeting 4/5 star females for genotyping so that herds will have as many genotyped 4/5 star females as possible on 31<sup>st</sup>Oct 2020.  In addition, my Department introduced flexibility in allowing the results of later evaluations be considered while also allowing animals whose rating improved while in the herd to be considered.</p><p>Over 2,000 herd owners have been telephoned by ICBF staff in recent months to explain that they were not on course to meet the genotyped 4/5 star female target on 31<sup>st</sup>Oct and to offer advice to these herd owners on the best course of action. ICBF will continue to monitor herds up to 31<sup>st</sup>Oct and will contact any herds that fall into non-compliance.</p><p>ICBF, in conjunction with my Department and ICOS, has assisted marts to arrange special sales of genotyped 4/5 star females. Herds with surplus females were notified of these sales by letter and text message. Herds that need to purchase these animals were also notified. These sales will continue to run between now and 31<sup>st</sup>Oct.  A new &lsquo;Mart Tracker&rsquo; facility was also made available by ICBF which allows farmers to see the numbers of genotyped 4/5 star females being traded through marts every day.</p><p>Articles have been published in farming media since the outset of the programme in 2015 with the focus in more recent times on ensuring farmers meet the 31<sup>st</sup>October requirement. The requirement has been in the programme since its inception and each participant would have been made aware of it as part of the compulsory training module that accompanied the programme and that each participant was required to attend. Failure to meet the requirement this year in either BDGP I or BDGP II will result in penalties being applied to payments as provided for in the Terms and Conditions of both programmes.</p></reply>

Regulation (EU) 1307 of 2013 sets out the annual Direct Payment ceilings for each Member State for the relevant financial years. The annual ceiling in 2019 for Direct Payments was &euro;1.211 billion of which approximately &euro;1.2 billion has been paid to farmers. Where the ceiling has not been fully utilised, these amounts remain available to the Member States to pay applicants who subsequently become eligible for payment.  Such payments are currently ongoing across all scheme years. Additional to this, annual provisions are made for market measures as per market demands. In 2019, Ireland received an additional allocation for Temporary Exceptional Aid (BEAM Scheme) from the EAGF amounting to &euro;50 million. To date, &euro;49.8 million has been paid to farmers from this fund.</p><p>European Agriculture Rural Development Fund (EAFRD)</p><p>&euro;2.19 billion was allocated to Ireland from the EAFRD for the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  The funding is for the full period of the programme and under the &quot;N+3&quot; rule expenditure up to 2023 is eligible to be claimed  against the 2014-2020 allocation. As of 31<sup>st</sup>December 2019, Ireland incurred expenditure that attracted EAFRD funding of &euro;1.65 billion. Our execution rate is one of the highest in Europe &ndash; the most recent being in excess of 80% as opposed to an EU average of 60%. In 2019, EAFRD funds claimed in Ireland amounted to &euro;338.6million vs an indicative allocation of &euro;312.7 million. While the Rural Development Programme Financial Plan sets out an indicative allocation of approximately &euro;313million for each of the 7 years 2014-2020, where expenditure in a year is less than the indicative allocation the amount available for subsequent years of the programme is increased accordingly. Thus, the extent of unspent EU funds can only be measured at the end of the programming period, rather than on an annual basis.</p><p>Publication of CAP Beneficiaries</p><p>In accordance with Regulation (EU) 1306 of 2013, the Department is obliged to ensure the annual ex-post publication of all of the beneficiaries of CAP funding, which shall remain available for two years from the date of the initial publication. In accordance with this Regulation my Department must, by 31st May each year, publish the following data:</p><p>- The name of the beneficiary (unless the amount of payment under CAP funds is less than &euro;1,250, in which case the individual will be identified by a code)</p><p>- The municipality where the beneficiary is resident</p><p>- The amount of payment corresponding to each measure received by a beneficiary, and</p><p>- The nature and description of each measure.</p><p>Information regarding payments made under these measures may be accessed in the CAP Beneficiaries Database via the following link  <i> commonagriculturalpolicycap/capbeneficiariesdatabase/</i>.</p></reply>

The clarifications brought about by these cases have resulted in the Department introducing a revised Appropriate Assessment Procedure for forestry licensing. </p>  <p>These changes in process are very significant, but unavoidable, and have led to delays in the issue of licences, as most files now require 2nd   stage Appropriate Assessment.  The delay in issuing licences is not the only delaying factor as there is also a third-party right of appeal on any licence granted. There are approximately 350 cases currently on the books of the Forestry Appeals Committee with this number growing.  </p>  <p>  My Department is doing everything it can to address this backlog including significant increase in resources for new ecologists and forestry inspectors. We have also put in place detailed project plans for the purposes on increasing the output of new licences with a detailed project management structure.  </p>  <p>  The Government has approved the urgent drafting of a stand-alone Agriculture Appeals (Amendment) Bill. This will reform the forestry appeals process by bringing it into line with similar planning processes. I have published the draft Bill for public consultation on 30 July for a four-week period with a closing date on Friday 28 August. My officials are currently reviewing nearly 9,000 submissions on the draft Bill received by the closing date and, in parallel,  work is ongoing with the OPC on further drafting of the Bill with a view to its presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The experience gained from existing agri-environmental schemes such as GLAS and the locally-led schemes run by my Department will be taken into account in designing new measures.

The economic challenges are wide ranging and have impacted across all sectors.  </p>  <p>  The Government response will continue to be reviewed and will evolve in order to best meet current and future challenges as they arise.  </p>  <p>  While the fishing industry, unlike many other industries, has been permitted to operate throughout the pandemic, I am very conscious of the impact of the pandemic on global seafood markets and the consequential reduction in level of activity. Whilst fish prices have been negatively impacted throughout the Covid period these impacts have been varied depending on the species and market being targeted. For many species, markets have remained open and fishermen have been able to sell their products. In addition, the Covid crisis has occurred during a period when the fuel prices for fishermen have been greatly reduced and that has assisted the viability of fishing activity throughout the period.  </p>  <p>  To date, a  broad range of supports have been made  available to the fisheries sector through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme and more generally from Government. Fishing vessel owners whose trading income ceased due to the Covid-19 pandemic, or crew members who lost their job or were temporarily laid off, were eligible to avail of income supports under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, while vessel owners with salaried crew members who instead maintain those crew members on the payroll were eligible for the Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Further details on current horizontal measures that are available to the fishing sector are available from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and from the Revenue Commissioners respectively. </p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, for the months of June, July and August, safety net supports were available through the EMFF Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme to fishermen who choose to tie-up their vessel for up to two months.  The Scheme supported the fixed costs of these vessels based on the official data on such costs obtained from the fleet through the Sentinel Vessel Programme and economic survey data provided by inshore fishermen through the grant aid process.  Supports of &euro;800 per month were available for vessels 10-12 metres, &euro;750 for vessels 8-10 metres and &euro;500 for vessels under 8 metres.  These supports complemented the income supports separately provided by Government. </p>  <p>  Supports of up to 80% of investment costs are available through the EMFF schemes administered by BIM for a wide variety of business activities and details of these schemes can be found on the BIM website.  </p>  <p>  Fishermen operate from a very wide variety of Harbours around the State and the majority of these are owned and managed by the relevant local authority. It is a matter for each local authority to consider the position in relation to charges in those local authority harbours. While there are no current plans to waive harbour dues in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, I will continue to review the matter taking account of the evolving situation and the range of horizontal Government supports available.</p></reply>

Much of this research has been performed in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Britain with similar results emerging.  The Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Research Analysis (CVERA) in UCD has been responsible for much of the research in Ireland but similar studies on risk emanate from Northern Ireland and Britain also.  The results of these epidemiological analyses inform the Department's advice and initiatives on helping farmers to reduce risk to TB on their farms.  Examples of the issues which can put an animal or a herd at a higher risk of TB include:</p>  <p>  1. Animals that had previously tested inconclusive to a TB skin test, but had passed all tests thereafter are higher risk.  This is because the skin test will identify only 80% of infected animals, on average, because of the failure in some cases of the animals immune system to mount a strong enough reaction.  Because of this, previously inconclusive animals are restricted to the herd of disclosure for life and are removed if that herd experiences a TB breakdown. </p>  <p>  2. Animals which had been present during a TB breakdown previously are at a higher risk for TB.  The reason for this is similar to inconclusives higher risk.  The animals were exposed to TB during the original breakdown and, in some cases, these may have become infected but for immunological reasons some may not react to testing and therefore remain as false negatives, i.e. clear animals.  This phenomenon is called residual TB and is a significant reason why it can take up to 10 years for a herd to return to normal levels of risk after experiencing a TB breakdown.  It is advisable for animals that were previously present during a breakdown to be considered for culling when decisions are being made on farms on which animals to retain, if the herdowner wishes to reduce the risk of a TB breakdown.</p>  <p>  3. Animals which have had multiple movements are at higher risk for TB than animals which have not.  This is associated with the increased potential for exposure to sources of infection because of movement between different herds and lands.</p>  <p>  4. Significant variation in inherited susceptibility to TB has been identified and farmers can now choose to breed from bulls whose offspring are more resistant to TB.</p>  <p>  5. Many studies have reported increased prevalence of TB with age meaning older cows are higher risk for TB.  This is associated with increased chance to exposure to infection sources.  This factor should be considered when making culling decisions to increase herd resilience. </p>  <p>  The definition of a closed herd is one where none of the animals within the herd have been purchased from, or returned from, outside the herd.  Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc have published advice over many years on the benefits for animal disease in maintaining a closed herd.  This crucial biosecurity measure is beneficial across all cattle diseases &ndash; not just TB.  </p>  <p>  My officials provide this advice to farmers so that they can make choices appropriate to their own farming circumstances to reduce their risk of TB, should they so wish.</p></reply>

In the past 12 months, 20,993 cattle have been slaughtered as reactors under the TB eradication programme, as they are deemed to be infected with the TB disease agent. The test specificity is estimated at 99.98%, meaning the number of false positives to the skin test is estimated at 1 animal in 5,000 tested.  However, the skin test has an estimated sensitivity of 80% which means that approximately 1 in 5 animals infected with TB will not be identified by the test, on average.  This means that false negatives are much more problematic for the TB programme than false positives.  </p>  <p>  Visual inspection of reactor carcases at post-mortem finds that, on average, approximately 30% of such reactors have visible lesions of tuberculosis, meaning the infection has progressed to a stage where the disease process has caused such significant tissue damage that it can be seen with the naked eye. If a reactor does not have visible disease lesions, it does not mean it is not infected; visual inspection cannot detect the presence of microscopic lesions and bacteria within the tissues of such animals. </p>  <p>  Separately from the slaughter of TB reactors, all non-Tb reactor cattle routinely slaughtered in Ireland are subjected to a post-mortem veterinary inspection which includes surveillance for lesions suspected to be caused by TB. Each year, approximately 3,600 such suspect lesions are identified and of these, approximately 45% are subsequently found by laboratory testing to have been caused by TB. The herds from which those animals came are then subjected to follow-up testing to identify any other undetected infected cattle.</p></reply>

In this way it has helped farmers and the sector more widely to deal with challenges associated with issues such as market volatility and climate change.</p>  <p>  This process of evolution continues with the latest proposals for the post-2020 CAP, which, among other things, seek to increase further the level of climate ambition and give Member States more autonomy in designing measures to achieve EU objectives, while also requiring them to monitor and report on performance in a more comprehensive manner. Member States will also be expected to set out how they will contribute to the achievement of the targets outlined in the new EU Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies.   </p>  <p>  While it is fair to say that I am content with the overall direction of travel that the CAP is taking, there remains a number of issues to resolve in the ongoing negotiations. I am consulting widely with stakeholder organisations on these issues and will input appropriately to the discussions in the coming weeks. I will also continue to consult with stakeholders on the development of Ireland's new CAP Strategic Plan, and on the measures that should be implemented in the transitional period between the current and future CAP frameworks. </p>  <p>  I would also add that it is imperative that the level of ambition for the CAP is matched by appropriate funding. In this regard, I welcome the agreement in July by Heads of State and Government on the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU Recovery Instrument, and I look forward to the timely conclusion of the next phase of discussions with the European Parliament.</p></reply>

The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 19 schemes.  The Programme is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union. Through the EMFF Programme, I am continuing to support the fishing sector through a broad range of supports.  </p><p>The Annual EMFF allocation provided to Ireland is detailed in the Finance Plan incorporated in the EMFF Programme document and for convenience is reproduced below (Table 1).  These funds are paid to Ireland only following expenditure by Ireland and submission by Ireland to the Commission of recoupment claims.  Under the so-called n+3 rule, annual allocations to a Member State would be decommitted if the Member State does not submit sufficient claims to the Commission.  Expenditure on Ireland's Programme to date has been very strong, so unlike many Member States Ireland has lost no funds in this way.  </p><p>Separately, the EMFF Regulation provides for annual pre-payment by the Commission of certain amounts to Member States to assist them with cash flow in funding projects prior to recoupment from the Commission.  These pre-payments are part of the overall allocation to the Member State.  As part of the annual clearance of accounts process, if recoupment claims submitted by a Member State for the accounting year concerned are not sufficient to cover both these pre-payments and the annual allocation, then the Commission recovers the amount of pre-financing not covered, through offsets against claims due.  Such recoveries are financial balancing exercises and are not a loss to the Member State, and do not affect the overall allocation to the Member State.  To date, approximately &euro;6.5 million in pre-payments have been recovered by the Commission.  </p><p>Supports to the fishing sector are primarily provided through measures implemented under Union Priority 1 &ndash; Sustainable Development of Fisheries, which has a total allocation under the Programme of &euro;55.59 million. Table 2 below provides information on annual spend under the Programme and to the fishing sector under UP1. </p><p><b>Table 1.

The EU Commission prepares impact assessments of such agreements and proposed regulations.  The EU Commission figures indicate that last year the EU27 imported &euro;42 million of lobster products from the US (15% of overall extra-EU imports), out of a market worth &euro;290 million in total and in which EU producers are supplying less than 5% of EU consumption.  It is important to be aware that the agreement is not solely focused on lobster and encompasses proposed tariff reductions on a range of EU products going to the US, including prepared seafood but also non-food products. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the uncertainty that this agreement has created for the Irish fishing industry.  If EU imports of US lobster increase significantly, it could combine to further impact on prices and demand; however, the US also exports to other international markets.  Irish seafood, particularly products like lobster, rely on healthy export markets and the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality, retail and caf&eacute; sectors across the EU and elsewhere has undoubtedly made 2020 a difficult trading year  </p>  <p>  For this reason, Ireland's representatives put the concerns of the Irish fishing industry on record at the recent Trade Policy Committee meeting in Brussels when the EU Commission presented the agreement.  In the meantime, Bord Bia has advised that the European lobster, the species caught in Ireland, has greater recognition which helps in maintaining a higher market position and that prices received reflect this in the EU market place.</p></reply>

This objective is also reflected in UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 published on 20th May 2020 provides a commitment that protected areas for at least 30% of seas in Europe will be established and that 10% of the area is strictly protected. </p>  <p>  Under the OSPAR Convention to Protect the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, Ireland committed to establishing marine protected areas to protect biodiversity (i.e. OSPAR MPAs). Such OSPAR MPAs would not afford any legal protection to the relevant areas on their own. Ireland (like other OSPAR contracting Parties) established 19 of its Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) as OSPAR MPAs for marine habitats. It is important to note that MPAs cannot be equated with Marine Reserves, i.e. as &lsquo;no-take&rsquo; zones where the extraction of marine organisms, or habitat impact , is prohibited.  The 10% strict protection in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 may involve a form of no take zones. In Ireland, the 1992 EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EC), as transposed by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477 of 2011), as amended, is the legislative instrument providing protection to species and habitats listed in the EU Habitats Directive, including in the marine environment.  For habitats in the marine area, this protection regime is applicable within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  Under this legislation, a series of habitats and species are identified for which Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) must be created and within which these habitats must be maintained at favourable conservation status.  Natura 2000 sites are selected with the aim of ensuring the long-term survival of species and habitats protected under the Birds and the Habitats Directive. The choice of sites is based on scientific criteria.</p>  <p>  At present there is a network of 80 Natura sites around the coast and 5 offshore sites.  These cover a significant area of near shore waters around the coast. In addition, the Minister introduced a ban on large fishing trawlers fishing inside Ireland&rsquo;s 6 mile zone from January 2020, which is subject to Judicial Review. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to &lsquo;developing comprehensive legislation for the identification, designation, and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Irish territorial waters.&rsquo; This Programme further assures that Ireland&rsquo;s outstanding target of 10% will be &lsquo;achieved as soon as is practical&rsquo; and aims for &lsquo;30% of marine protected areas by 2030&rsquo;, which it states will be done &lsquo;on the basis of scientific expertise and in close consultation with all stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry, as well as environmental and community representatives.&rsquo; </p>  <p>  A formal consultation process on the future expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs was launched by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) on 18th August 2020. An independent expert Advisory Group on the expansion of MPAs was appointed by that Department  in December 2019 and is chaired by Professor Tasman Crowe of the UCD Earth Institute. Representatives from the Marine Institute (the State agency responsible for marine research) sit on this Advisory group. This Advisory group was created to gather the views of stakeholders and consultation with stakeholders forms part of the terms of reference of the group. The advisory group is using two consultative approaches: focus groups and an online questionnaire. </p>  <p>  The process of interactive consultation with all stakeholders and the public began with a series of online stakeholder focus groups hosted by the Advisory group. DHLGH has advised that there have been four moderated online meetings so far, and that all of the main fisheries organisations: the four main producer organisations (the Irish Fish Producers Organisation; the Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation; the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation; and the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation) and the main inshore fisheries organisations (the National Inshore Fisherman&rsquo;s Forum; the National Inshore Fisherman&rsquo;s Association and the various Regional Inshore Fisheries Fora) have been invited to attend these meetings.</p>  <p>  In August 2020, the Advisory group circulated an online questionnaire to a wide range of stakeholders, providing respondents with an opportunity to share their views on MPAs; the future expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s MPA network; and the preferred approach to selecting, designating and managing MPAs in the short and longer term. The information gathered by the Advisory group, through both consultative approaches, will inform its expert considerations and its final report.

My Department is providing additional vital supports to rural and community organisations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:</p><p>On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations. These initiatives provide support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for their crisis telephone support line, and an email helpdesk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries. </p><p>On 9 April last, an initial &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that are participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which is being led by the Local Authorities. </p><p>On 11 May 2020, a &euro;40 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and is administered by the Department. This funding is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society. </p><p><b>The package included:</b></p><p>A &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund which will provide a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis; and</p><p>A &euro;5 million Government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which will focus on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges.</p><p>To date, funding of over &euro;25million has been allocated to more than 480 organisations under the COVID 19 stability Fund. This funding is supporting the delivery of critical services in every part of the country.</p><p>This funding is provided in addition to the more than &euro;45 million in funding, announced last November, for the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020. That funding was allocated for 43 separate measures to be delivered across nine Government Departments to benefit disadvantaged groups.</p><p>The funding package for these organisations is complementary to the range of other supports provided by the Government to support businesses, employers and employees on foot of the crisis.</p><p>As a result of COVID-19 my Department also developed a &euro;1.2m Support Fund to assist Community Service Programme, or CSP, supported organisations. </p><p>In June 2020, the Department launched the 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m. The CEP provides capital grants towards enhancing the facilities available to communities. The CEP is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.</p><p>In August, with funding from the July stimulus package, the Department launched a &euro;5m fund under the Community Enhancement Programme for community centres and community buildings. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s other investment programmes, such as the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, CL&Aacute;R programme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which support large and small scale capital development in rural areas, continue to be rolled out and all place a particular emphasis on supporting a post-COVID recovery.</p><p>In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when safe to do so.</p><p>My Department also funds the COVID-19 Community Outreach (CCO) programme. Coordinated by  the Wheel and Irish Rural Link the programme links and supports the work of thousands of community groups across Ireland who are responding to meet the needs of communities during the COVID-19 crisis.</p></reply>

The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p>  <p>  3. Persons with a disability.</p>  <p>  1,060 applications were received and were assessed and prioritised on the basis of need.  </p>  <p>  The primary aim of the COVID 19 Stability Fund was to assist eligible community and voluntary, charity and social enterprises who are experiencing financial difficulties due to a reduction in their fundraising income and / or traded income as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The criteria of the scheme stated that any grants awarded would be dependent on the need identified and organisations approved for funding were prioritised on that basis. In this context it was considered that organisations that receive 80%, or more, of their funding from State sources are considered to have had a significant and stable source of income over the period under consideration, as the State has continued to provide that funding. </p>  <p>  On the basis of the information provided by the organisation in question as part of their application, that organisation is in receipt of more than 80% of its funding from State sources and, accordingly, was not approved for funding under the COVID19 Stability Scheme. </p>  <p>  I understand that some organisations may be disappointed with the outcome, or may have additional or updated information they may wish to have reviewed. For that reason, there is a Stability Scheme Appeals Process and all organisations, including the one in question, were offered leave to appeal their funding decision.</p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme (CSP), funded through my Department and administered by Pobal, currently supports over 400 community organisations, including the organisation in question, to provide local services through a social enterprise model with funding provided as a contribution to the cost of an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) (&euro;19,033 per annum) and a manager (&euro;32,000 per annum), where warranted. </p>  <p>  The organisation in question has been allocated funding of &euro;110,563 in 2020 towards the cost of a manager and four FTEs.

The personal and social development of persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged; or</p><p>2. The educational development of persons who are educationally disadvantaged; or</p><p>3. Persons with a disability.</p><p>Over 1000 applications were received during the application period. Due to the considerable interest in the Stability Scheme and to facilitate prompt drawdown, applications were assessed in batches and funding has been released in tranches. To date three tranches have been announced, supporting more than 480 organisations with funding of over &euro;25 million, which included the funding of 12 community radio stations. This funding is supporting the delivery of many critical frontline services in every part of the country. </p><p>A full list of successful applicants can be found at the link below. Additional checks continue on a small number of organisations and a further announcement will be made shortly.</p><p>Community Radio Stations were eligible to apply under Phase One of the Stability Scheme which closed for applications on the 21st of May 2020.  I have no plans to reopen the scheme to new applicants at this time.</p></reply>

A Final Three-Year Review Report, detailing the progress made by the Taskforce since 2016, is due for publication in Q4 of this year. </p>  <p>  Attention has now turned towards the future orientation of the Taskforce in line with the Programme for Government commitment to continue to support the work of the group.</p>  <p>  While I have not yet had an opportunity to meet the Taskforce members, officials from my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have had engagements with the members and with industry on the future direction of the group.  Based on these engagements, the Departmental officials are actively discussing future options for the Taskforce, to ensure it remains effective in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and broadband services around Ireland. </p>  <p>  I envisage that a new direction for the Taskforce will be agreed in the near future which will build on the success and positive engagement of the group up to now across central government, local government, statutory agencies and industry.</p></reply>
