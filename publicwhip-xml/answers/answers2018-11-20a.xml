    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-20a.38.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000066#WRAAA02500"><p> Since military security operations began in Rakhine State, Myanmar in August 2017, approximately 720,000 refugees, mostly Rohingya, have fled to Bangladesh. The people and government of Bangladesh have demonstrated extraordinary generosity in receiving such a large influx of refugees in very difficult circumstances.  I remain very concerned at the ongoing situation in Myanmar and the plight of these refugees who are living in extremely precarious conditions in overcrowded refugee camps.  Ireland remains unwavering in its wish to see conditions that will enable the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of these Rohingya refugees to their places of origin in Myanmar in compliance with international human rights norms and the principle of non-refoulement.</p>  <p>  I note that the signing of Memoranda of Understanding on the repatriation of the Rohingya between Myanmar and Bangladesh and between Myanmar and the UNDP and UNHCR have been important first steps on this path of return.</p>  <p>  However, current conditions on the ground in Myanmar are not conducive to allow for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of members of the Rohingya community. </p>  <p>  In that regard, I am concerned by the recent arrangement between Myanmar and Bangladesh to begin the return of up to 5,000 refugees in the near future. I note the concerns expressed by UNHCR, who are on-the-ground, and the fact that UN agencies have not been included in these discussions. I also note concerning reports that many of the refugees concerned do not wish to be repatriated given conditions on the ground in Rakhine State. </p>  <p>  Therefore, I call on Myanmar and Bangladesh to reconsider this arrangement and to take the necessary steps to create such conditions before taking any further or premature steps towards repatriation. I urge the parties to undertake further dialogue with international partners while also allowing the voices of the refugee community to play a key role in determining their future.</p>  <p>  I also echo the calls for the full implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.</p></reply>

Ireland works within and alongside the EU and UN to address the persecution of religious minorities wherever it occurs. I am, of course, aware of the case of Asia Bibi, a Pakistani woman convicted in 2010 of Blasphemy and sentenced to death. Following an appeal, the Supreme Court of Pakistan recently overturned her conviction.  </p>  <p>  Minister Flanagan raised concerns on the blasphemy laws with his Pakistani counterpart on the margins of the UN General Assembly in September 2016.  Minister Flanagan also raised the case with the Pakistani Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;Affaires in January 2016. The European Union has also raised the case with the Pakistani authorities.  I continue to follow developments in the case and strongly condemn all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur and who the victims are.</p>  <p>Ireland attaches great importance to the fundamental human rights of freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years. I have asked my staff to review the cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport and to compare it to the cost of a similar passport in many other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;8.50 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.70 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.</p>  <p>  Based on 2017 application volumes, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of eliminating the passport application fee for applicants over 65 years of age to be over &euro;6.2m.  Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed.  </p>  <p>  In the context of the services provided by the Passport Service, I would like to draw attention to the well-advanced Passport Reform Programme, one element of which is an online passport application service which was launched on 30 March 2017. </p>  <p>  To date over 273,000 adults have renewed their passport using this online facility. At present, the online passport application service accommodates adult passport renewal applications and passport card applications. The Passport Service is in the process of expanding this service further by the end of 2018.  </p>  <p>  The online passport application service enables adults to renew their passports within ten working days without the need for paperwork or witnesses. The service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere in the world. While the online service does not distinguish between applicants&rsquo; based on age, applicants can be assured that the online system will be the cheapest as well as the most efficient, secure and convenient way to apply to renew their passport.</p></reply>

Although some have called for it, there is currently no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, or any member of the Coalition. I am aware that some Member States, including Germany, have decided to halt arms exports for the present. </p><p>For now, Irish efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of Export Control Regimes and the implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty, which has been signed and ratified by all EU Member States, and requires States to assess the potential that arms exports could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law, and to consider measures to mitigate the risk of these violations.</p><p>I firmly believe that effective measures to monitor the trade of arms and other dual use goods are necessary to ensure that the highest standards in international arms controls are met, and to tackle the illicit trade in arms. </p><p>As a member of multiple disarmament and non-proliferation Treaties and Conventions, Ireland has a responsibility to ensure that adequate domestic controls are implemented. </p><p>All exports of goods from Ireland which are dual-use or have a military classification are subject to strict assessment on a case by case basis against the eight criteria contained in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  The Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation is the lead Department on issuing export licenses. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade plays a role in the assessment of export licenses for military rated and dual use goods, with the aim of ensuring that:</p><blockquote>The goods are destined for the country and end-user as stated on the licence application;<br /><br />The stated end-user will use the goods for a legitimate purpose, as detailed in the end-user certificate.<br /><br />That there is no risk the goods may diverted to end users of concern, or that the goods may be used for human rights<br /><br />suppression.</blockquote><p>Ireland will continue to assess all military rated and dual use goods license applications on a case by case base, ensuring compliance with our international obligations.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, this visit was subsequently postponed, with the US Administration citing scheduling reasons. There are frequent and ongoing contacts between the Government and the US Administration at Ministerial and official level on the wide range of issues of mutual interest, and on international issues.  To date, we have not received an indication, through these contacts, of when a possible future visit from President Trump might take place.</p>  <p>  The visit of any US President offers an opportunity to reinforce the strong historic, economic, cultural and family ties shared by the US and Ireland - as well as an opportunity for good, open discussions on current issues.  The US President is of course welcome to visit Ireland and has a standing invitation to do so, just as the Irish have a standing invitation to Washington DC every March.  </p>  <p>  I discussed Ireland-EU-US relations earlier this month with my colleagues in Government.  The importance of continued engagement at Ministerial and official level with US leaders, and on sectoral issues of mutual interest, was noted - as was the desirability of increasing the numbers of US high level visits to Ireland in the coming years.  </p>  <p>  In the context of a changing transatlantic relationship, this enhanced and targeted engagement is critical, as we seek to protect and promote Ireland&rsquo;s values, interests and prosperity.

Guardians will be required to print this form, have the child&rsquo;s identity verified by an appropriate witness, and have the consent of all guardians witnessed.  Guardians will then need to submit the form, along with any other required documents to the Passport Service in order to commence the processing of the application.  There is a significant list of appropriate witnesses who can complete both of these tasks.</p>  <p>  Guardians who are renewing their child&rsquo;s passport will also be able to apply for a passport card for their child for the first time.

Conflict is the most significant driver of this increased need.  </p>  <p>  Ireland prioritises the provision of needs based, principled humanitarian aid to high profile humanitarian crises such as Syria but also to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo; which receive less attention such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Sudan. Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding in 2017 was directed in support of those affected by conflict.</p>  <p>  Critical to maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response is our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations.  Ireland is a strong contributor not just to decisions regarding the international humanitarian response to crises but also to efforts to prevent conflict and to resolve conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a deep partnership with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA.  OCHA coordinates and leads coherent and effective international responses to humanitarian crises. </p>  <p>  Among other funds, OCHA manages the Central Emergency Response Fund, which responds to sudden onset disasters and to under-funded crises.  Ireland is a strong supporter of both mechanisms and the current chair of the OCHA donor support group, which works with the Office the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.  A key priority for Ireland as chair is to ensure that Ireland plays an effective international role on the protection of civilians and to uphold international humanitarian law.  In international forums, Ireland consistently advocates for adherence to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and called on all parties &ndash; for example, those engaged in the Syria conflict &ndash; to fulfill their responsibility to protect civilians and to allow the safe passage of humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  Promoting international peace and security in regions of conflict is a core mission of the United Nations.  By necessity, United Nations authorised interventions are required in the most sensitive war zones.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts.  Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and has more than 570 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  The Government is committed to participation in peace-keeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security.  This commitment informs Ireland&rsquo;s decision to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22.  If elected, membership of the Security Council would allow Ireland to play an important influencing role in the international response to the needs of the most vulnerable.</p></reply>

We are taking forward extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work across all Government Departments and Agencies. This planning, as appropriate, includes any specific responses necessary according to regional needs and at the county level, including those of Cavan, Monaghan, and Cork of which I am, of course, acutely aware.</p>  <p>  As part of prudent preparation for Brexit, steps need to be taken at national level, at EU level and by business and citizens who will be affected.  </p>  <p>  The underlying strength and resilience of our economy is critical in ensuring that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring and this has been a key factor in developing successive budgets including in Budget 2019. </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to be put in place for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an East-West basis.  The recruitment of an additional 1,000 staff for customs and SPS controls, in addition to ICT and infrastructure measures at our ports and airports has been sanctioned and implementation is underway.  Various contingency measures, such as the rapid redeployment of customs staff, are also under active consideration in a disorderly Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  Businesses and other affected sectors need to respond and prepare themselves and the Government is providing an array of support and information measures to assist them. Specific support measures and schemes are now in place for the business and agri-food sector. To better inform our businesses and citizens the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign was launched in September.  Very successful outreach events were held in October and more will follow this month. </p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to citizens is the work on the Common Travel Area to ensure that the arrangements by which Irish and British citizens can live, work and access public services in each other&rsquo;s countries will continue into the future in any Brexit scenario. </p>  <p>  In a number of key areas the appropriate response and mitigation will be at the EU level and we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland. The Commission has flagged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication last week.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is also working closely with fellow member states to discuss areas of key concern, particularly facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p>  <p>  While we respect the decisions of the British people, we did not seek Brexit nor has it ever been our view that it is a positive step.  We continue to engage in extensive contingency planning across Government, with a view to mitigating as far as possible the negative outcomes that will arise when the UK leaves the EU, particularly in a disorderly Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

This broad-ranging commitment includes capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies. It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).   Progress has been made in alleviating the plight of migrants in Libya but this must be built upon. Since 2014, the EU has mobilised &euro;286 million on migration projects in Libya, &euro;20 million as bilateral assistance and &euro;266 million through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Using the Trust Fund, the EU is working to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings. Assistance includes hygiene kits, basic non-food items and medical care. Funds are also being used to work towards the stabilisation of host communities, for example through socio-economic development at municipal level. Projects are being implemented by international partners on the ground, including the UNHCR and UNICEF, and by EU Member States. Ireland has pledged &euro;15 million for the Fund, of which &euro;12 million is unearmarked, and overall Ireland&rsquo;s is the third highest per capita contribution by an EU Member State.</p>  <p>  Support programmes have provided training to the Libyan authorities on international standards and human rights training. They have also focused on setting up mixed community development spaces and safe spaces as alternatives to detention centres. There has been progress in the efforts to support migrants stranded in Libya and wishing to return to their home countries. As an alternative to detention centres, the EU has also been supporting voluntary repatriation, voluntary return and the humanitarian return of migrants from Libya. So far in 2018, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has helped over 14,600 migrants to return voluntarily to their country of origin from Libya, with support from the EU. </p>  <p>  While the EU has engaged substantially on this issue, further work remains to be done. I am deeply troubled by the persistent human rights abuse that have been perpetrated against migrants in Libyan detention centres, as reported by the UN Human Rights Office and others. I have raised these concerns at the Foreign Affairs Council and the Taoiseach has raised them at the European Council. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require the restoration of political stability, and an end to lawlessness in Libya. This requires the formation of a fully functioning and unified government, and a return to order throughout the country. I call on all parties to cooperate fully with UN Special Representative Ghassan Salam&eacute;, whose efforts Ireland and the EU fully support. </p>  <p>  I commend Italy&rsquo;s efforts in hosting the conference on Libya in Palermo last week. I particularly welcome the conclusions announced following the conference, which call for a Libyan-led inclusive national conference to be held in early 2019, followed by an electoral process in spring. I call on all parties in Libya to uphold their commitments. An inclusive, Libyan-led reconciliation process is the only path to completing Libya&rsquo;s transition, and bringing about a sovereign, democratic and stable country, that respects and protects the rights of all citizens, and all others in Libya.</p></reply>

Such violence is entirely unacceptable, and I would once again call on the Government of Colombia to ensure that all such incidents are thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators brought to justice.  I continue to be concerned about the attacks targeting social and community leaders in Colombia. The peace deal between the Colombian Government and FARC-EP group signed in November 2016 offered great hope that the 50 year cycle of armed conflict would be brought to an end. It is worth recalling that this conflict took the lives of at least 220,000 Colombians and displaced close to six million people.</p>  <p>  The signing of this agreement was a historic moment but, as we know from our experience in Ireland, the signing of a peace agreement only marks the beginning of a process. We in Ireland understand the slow and painstaking work that goes into building trust between communities to enable reconciliation and to develop a culture of trust. We have had many dark moments and setbacks on our own road to peace.</p>  <p>  My Department has an ongoing commitment to support peace and human rights in Colombia, including through the full implementation of the country&rsquo;s peace accord.  As well as exchanges with the Colombian authorities at Government level, officials at the Department and at the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico (which at present has responsibility for Colombia) engage regularly with the European Union Delegation and other embassies in Bogota, as well as with human rights defenders and civil society leaders active across the country.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also pleased to provide ongoing support to former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore in his role as EU Special Envoy to the Colombian peace process. Appointed to this role by HRVP Federica Mogherini in November 2015, Eamon Gilmore has been working with both Colombian and EU stakeholders to support the peace process, especially in the implementation phase. </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed.  Historic strides have been made to date in its implementation. However, it is important to recognise that there remain significant challenges to its implementation, including in the areas of de-mining, attention to victims, transitional justice, and rural development, some of which directly impacts on the situation of political and community activists. </p>  <p>  The Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia (OHCHR) to support its essential work to promote and protect human rights including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. </p>  <p>  With the opening of our new embassy in Bogota early next year, we will be in an even stronger position to monitor the progress of the peace process and to work alongside our EU partners and other organisations active on the ground. I can assure the Deputy of our continued commitment to assisting the Colombian Government in their goal of achieving a brighter, more peaceful and more prosperous future for all Colombians.</p></reply>

This is an important and welcome breakthrough in the Brexit process.  It would not have been achieved without the commitment and professionalism of EU and the UK negotiators who have worked intensively over many months to reach this outcome. </p>  <p>  The Government, at both political and official levels, has remained in intensive contact with Michel Barnier and the EU Taskforce, and with other Member States throughout the process, and this will continue.  We have also maintained very good channels of communication with British counterparts. </p>  <p>  Yesterday I attended a General Affairs Council (Article 50) and expressed my sincere appreciation and gratitude to Michel Barnier and the EU Task Force for their tireless efforts, and to our fellow EU27 Member States who have consistently demonstrated solidarity and understanding for our concerns throughout this process. They understand that the importance of avoiding a hard border is not about concerns over the economic fallout, but about the harm it would bring to communities across Ireland and Northern Ireland, setting back the gains of the peace process considerably. </p>  <p>  On Sunday 25 November, there will be a European Council to sign off on the finalised Withdrawal Agreement. This agreement fully achieves our priorities at this stage, and we will support it.</p>  <p>  This is an important step, but still only a step, on a much larger journey. It is important to us to secure the deepest and most comprehensive relationship possible with the UK following its withdrawal from the EU. It is only through that relationship that we can secure the trade and other interests that are important to Ireland, the UK, and our EU partners. </p>  <p>  None of this can be taken for granted, however.</p>  <p>  Brexit will bring real changes for Ireland.  My Department leads co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit. It is in continuous contact with all government Departments and State Agencies to advance work our preparedness and contingency planning to ensure that Ireland is Brexit ready. </p>  <p>  Given the impact of Brexit across all levels of society, the Government has also been engaged in substantial public communications campaign on Brexit preparedness. Our &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; campaign will continue over the coming weeks to build further awareness among the public and key sectoral audiences on the steps being taken by Government, and the various financial and other supports that are available to assist with Brexit preparedness.</p></reply>

On 20 October, High Representative Federica Mogherini issued a statement on behalf of the European Union insisting on the need for &lsquo;continued thorough, credible and transparent investigation, shedding proper clarity on the circumstances of the killing and ensuring full accountability of all those responsible for it&rsquo;.  On 17 November, the High Representative issued a follow up statement reiterating this call and noting that &lsquo;the need remains to shed full clarity on the circumstances surrounding this horrendous crime&rsquo;.  As previously mentioned in the D&aacute;il, I met with Saudi Ambassador Al-Jubeir on 18 October and stressed the widespread shock caused by the case and the necessity for a credible and open investigation. Senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to the Ambassador in recent weeks. </p>  <p>  Having called for an investigation, we must wait and give consideration to findings based on verifiable evidence, before considering next steps. Though the media reports of the case are disturbing, we are still lacking verifiable facts at this stage. </p>  <p>  In the Salisbury case there was an EU decision to stand in solidarity with a Member State. This decision was taken on foot of extensive briefings by the UK and a compelling case made by Prime Minister May in support of her government&rsquo;s assessment that it was highly likely that the Russian Federation was responsible for the poisoning. Our decision to expel a Russian diplomat was made following an assessment that included various factors, including our own national security.</p>  <p>  At the UN Human Rights Council in September, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on &lsquo;Safety of Journalists&rsquo;, condemning all violence against journalists and urging all states to ensure accountability for such attacks. Ireland also specifically raised the Khashoggi case at the UN Human Rights Council on 5 November in our intervention during the Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s human rights record. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise concerns about human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever appropriate opportunities arise.</p></reply>

The absence of the Executive also means that the North South Ministerial Council cannot meet. </p>  <p>  I am currently engaging with Secretary of State Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the full operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I met with Secretary of State Bradley in Dublin on 17 September, in Belfast on 8 October, and most recently in Dublin on Friday 2 November at the British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference. I spoke further with the Secretary of State by telephone on Monday 12 November.</p>  <p>  Both Governments are continuing to engage with all of the political parties to seek a way forward to get the Institutions up and running again. All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and have provided views on their key concerns and issues. </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, I believe a new political process is required to get beyond the current impasse and secure the necessary agreement between the parties on operating the devolved institutions again.</p>  <p>  I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving that, but I firmly believe that a resolution is possible and that the calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate will be heeded.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely conscious of the challenges that the UK exit from the European Union has presented for the political process in Northern Ireland and the totality of relationships addressed by the Good Friday Agreement. The Government has worked intensively with the Commission Task Force and all of our EU partners in the Article 50 process with the UK to secure the draft Withdrawal Agreement which was agreed between the EU and UK negotiators and published on 14 November, and which is now being considered by EU Member States and the UK. The Taoiseach has confirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement will protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the Peace Process and avoid a hard border on the island. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I in our engagement with the British Government and the leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland have consistently underlined that, regardless of the challenges of the UK exit from the Union, there remains a pressing need to secure the operation of the devolved power-sharing institutions of the Agreement, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

We have discussed here in the Oireachtas on a number of occasions the question of whether the formal recognition of Palestine, in advance of its full achievement on the ground, would be a helpful step in advancing a resolution of the Israel- Palestine conflict.  I have also regularly discussed it with EU partners and with leaders in the region, including with President Abbas during his visit to Ireland in September. </p><p>One of the many factors bearing on this question is the importance of assessing whether recognition now would positively affect the peace process or merely be viewed as a symbolic gesture, swiftly overtaken and surpassed by events on the ground. </p><p>Unilateral recognition by Ireland will also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the Middle East Peace Process at EU and international level, and it is imperative that it does not diminish Ireland&rsquo;s impact as a peace interlocutor without delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people. </p><p>However, in the context of widespread frustration at the lack of political progress towards an agreement, and not least in light of the views expressed by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in 2014, I have stated that I will be ready to recommend immediate recognition of the State of Palestine to the Government if and when I believe it would be helpful in achieving our objective of a free and sovereign Palestinian state, or advancing the peace process to achieve it. I have not yet concluded that it would be helpful at this time, but situations change, and I keep this matter under continuous and active review. </p><p>Ireland remains fully committed to the resolution of the Middle East conflict, through an agreed settlement which includes the establishment of a sovereign State of Palestine recognised by all, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel, bringing to an end to the occupation that began in 1967. All of my actions on this issue are taken in pursuit of that objective.</p></reply>

The Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan TD, and I represented the Government.  The UK Government was represented by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington MP, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP. </p>  <p>  Set up under the Good Friday Agreement, the Conference brings together the Irish and UK Governments to promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  Following on from the BIIGC in London on 25 July, the meeting on 2 November provided the opportunity to continue our discussions on legacy issues, security co-operation, East-West matters, and political stability in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  At the meeting, we reaffirmed our commitment to implementing the framework established in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to comprehensively address the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past, taking account of the UK Government&rsquo;s public consultation on establishing the legacy institutions. </p>  <p>  On security co-operation, both Governments recalled the commitments made in the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to ending paramilitarism and welcomed the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) established under that Agreement. In considering the findings and recommendations contained in the report, the Conference noted in particular the IRC&rsquo;s view that the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is essential to ending paramilitarism and achieving community transformation. </p>  <p>  The Conference discussed a joint paper by Irish and British officials which outlined a number of possible models to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between Ireland and the UK after it leaves the European Union.  Both Governments agreed that these new structures for systemic bilateral co-operation should demonstrate the strength and depth of the relationship, provide opportunities for ministers and officials to continue to engage with each other, and provide an overall architecture for cooperation that is both meaningful and sustainable in the future. </p>  <p>  As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving Heads of Government and senior ministers and would alternate between locations in Ireland and the UK.  These summits would be supported by close bilateral work by ministers.  Officials on both sides have been asked to turn these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation for consideration at the next meeting of the Conference.</p>  <p>  The Conference provided both Governments the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements.  It was recognised that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have been essential for the progress made in Northern Ireland over the past two decades and that they remain the indispensable framework for the political process in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments reiterated their shared commitment to securing the operation of the devolved power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the consequent resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  It was agreed that the BIIGC would reconvene in Spring 2019.</p></reply>

The misery caused by the long-running conflict in Syria has been further prolonged by military support which has been provided to the Assad regime. There are significant Iranian forces in Syria, which have been assisting the regime in the violent suppression of its own people. This is unhelpful and unwelcome. It is also quite clear that Russia&rsquo;s support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians. Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the conflict, including hosting millions of refugees, as well as a risk of spill-over of violence and its concern about the conflict raging on its southern border is therefore understandable.  Our messages to Turkey, in relation to its operations in Syria, have emphasised our overarching concern for the protection of civilians, including in the context of this particular operation, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities.  The Syria crisis is high on the EU agenda, and was last discussed at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Vienna in August, where<b></b>EU support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict was restated. EU Foreign Ministers met with the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan di Mistura, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in September this year, and reaffirmed our strong support for his work and that of his team. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p><p>The EU&rsquo;s consistent position since the crisis began has been that the conflict can only be resolved by the Syrian people themselves. The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s work to bring about an end the conflict is undertaken in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which are clear on the need for this to be a Syrian-led political process. We support UNSE di Mistura&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to establish a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country. </p><p>I take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of the violence perpetrated against civilians that has characterised the Syrian conflict to date. I have frequently called on all regional actors, and all those involved in the Syria conflict, to show restraint and avoid any escalation, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as adding to the suffering of civilians. I have also called on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process.</p></reply>

A key part of this plan is investing in our presence overseas &ndash; deepening our network by strengthening our presence in key existing locations and opening new offices which will leverage the opportunities to grow our trade and inward investment, to further strengthen political relationships with our partners and promote our values, and to support Irish citizens and our diaspora abroad.  I believe it is prudent and wise to invest now in that global presence and I am delighted to say that work is well under way on the initial phase of the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved the set-up of 13 new offices including the opening of new embassies and consulates in Wellington, Vancouver, Bogot&aacute;, Santiago de Chile, Amman, Mumbai, Cardiff, LA, Frankfurt, Kyiv, Manila and Rabat. The Irish Aid office in Monrovia is also being upgraded to an Embassy. </p>  <p>  The new offices in Wellington and Vancouver opened in August and October 2018 respectively. These openings marked significant milestones in our expansion plan and I look forward to the next group of openings which will include the opening of new Embassies in Santiago de Chile, Bogot&aacute;, and Amman; and new Consulates General in Mumbai and Cardiff in early 2019. Planning is also underway for the opening of Consulates General in Frankfurt and LA in quarter four of 2019 and the opening of Embassies in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat within a tight timeframe thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The locations for new missions were identified on the basis of maximising impact in promoting our economic and political interests; expanding our influence in terms of values and in delivering clear benefits for the State. </p>  <p>  Global Ireland recognises the importance of reinforcing our existing network to enable us to better shape and influence international events in our interests.  It will allow us to play a more active role in supporting and promoting a rules based international environment and will help us play our full role in addressing some of the global challenges that will impact us over the period ahead.</p></reply>

I do not know what the intended purpose of this incursion was, but the effect seems to have been tragically counterproductive, at a time when a temporary ceasefire was in operation, and a long term truce in relation to Gaza seemed to have been in prospect. </p>  <p>  However, this provides no justification whatsoever for the very large-scale firing of rockets into Israel in retaliation. There appear to have been several hundred such rockets in a single day, and this could easily have resulted in much higher civilian casualties. Israeli forces, as is always the case, responded by attacking targets in Gaza they associate with Hamas.</p>  <p>  A reported eight people have been killed by hundreds of aerial attacks in each direction. In addition, very large numbers of civilians on both sides, including young children, spent many hours sheltering from such attacks, which must have been a traumatic experience.</p>  <p>  In view of the potential for further escalation, it is very welcome that an effective ceasefire was quickly re-established, and I commend all who were instrumental in achieving that, notably Egypt. I hope that this will allow progress towards a more durable truce to resume.</p>  <p>  More importantly than what triggered this episode, these events strongly reinforce what I have stressed in all my discussions on Gaza, both in the region and at EU and international level.  So long as the situation in Gaza is allowed to fester, these outbreaks of violence, each one threatening to be bigger and more destructive than the last, will only recur. The blockade is inhumane, and should be ended. All parties need to consider and attempt ways to change the dynamic and break this cycle.  Such possibilities have been a major feature of my own discussions on Gaza, and Ireland is advancing specific projects on educational scholarships and power infrastructure to contribute to this effort.</p></reply>

This is a priority for the Government, given the importance of the landbridge  in getting Irish products, in particular agri-food products, to market on continental Europe.  This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market. A Landbridge Project Group is chaired by my Department and involves all relevant Government Departments, including the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine, the Department of Health, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. The Project Group has met four times to date.  </p>  <p>  Work on is being taken forward in two strands. The first is through the Article 50 negotiations. In the mandate provided to the European Commission by the EU27 in May 2017, it was agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would take account of Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the UK).  </p>  <p>  The importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised and agreed through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.</p>  <p>  To this end, I also welcome the UK&rsquo;s formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to join the Common Transit Convention. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge.</p>  <p>  The second strand is our work with the European Commission and other affected Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code. This work is intensifying and good progress is being made.</p>  <p>  Relevant Departments have also been tasked by the Government to roll out detailed Action Plans with a view to advancing, as appropriate, the mitigating measures which have been identified in the areas of their responsibility from the planning to the implementation phase.  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade which will also take account of the continued use of the landbridge.</p></reply>

These events that have led to the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and the wounding of very many more, were senseless and avoidable.</p>  <p>  I have given a high priority to the Middle East conflict since I assumed office, and discuss it regularly with my European colleagues, as well as with my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts during my visits to the region.  Following the horrific events of 14 May 2018 in Gaza, I summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Iveagh House to convey the Government&rsquo;s view that the actions by Israeli security forces were unjustified and unacceptable. I made clear, as I have done publicly, that Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself did not justify these actions. </p>  <p>  I also raised Gaza with my EU counterparts, at the Foreign Affairs Council in May. I stressed the need to find practical ways to begin to ease the situation there, and to provide hope for an end to the cycle of recurring violence. Once again, we reiterated out commitment to reviving the political process, along the lines of the two- state solution. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, Ireland and other states requested the calling of a Special Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva to discuss these events. At that session, Ireland co-sponsored a motion in which the Human Rights Council set up a commission of inquiry into what happened. Ireland also supported a resolution at the UN General Assembly in New York which called for examination of means of protecting Palestinian civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland has worked consistently, particularly at EU and UN level, to encourage international attention to focus on the long running and worsening problems in Gaza, and the need to end the restrictions imposed by Israel which have a debilitating effect on the population, as well as the need to end rocket fire, shootings, and other violence in both directions.</p>  <p>  I have met the new Israeli Ambassador and raised with him my increasing concerns about the effects of the ongoing occupation of Palestine. I will continue to raise my concerns at every appropriate opportunity.</p>  <p>  I have replied separately to other Questions today about the exchange of fire across the Gaza border, which took place in the last week.</p></reply>

In addition, my Department&rsquo;s diplomatic staff in Ireland, our Permanent Representation to the UN in New York, and our entire Embassy network have been actively presenting our case and seeking support.</p>  <p>  At the United Nations General Assembly this year, the theme for the General Debate was "Making the United Nations relevant to all people: global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I delivered Ireland&rsquo;s National Statement to the General Debate in which I emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for multilateralism as the best way to address global problems.

Of this, &euro;544.9 million will be managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, whose Vote 27 &ndash; International Co-operation &ndash; is known publicly as Irish Aid.

The backstop, included in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement agreed by EU and UK negotiators, and accepted by the UK Cabinet, achieves this. We hope it will not be needed. Both sides are committed to the negotiation of a future EU-UK relationship that will be sufficiently close and comprehensive as to make it unnecessary.  However, if a future relationship agreement delivering that outcome is not operable by 31 December 2020, or by the end of any extended transition period, if that is requested, the backstop will apply unless and until it is superseded by alternative arrangements that ensure the same outcome.</p>  <p>  In the event that the backstop were applied, there would be a single EU-UK customs territory, negating the need for tariffs, quotas or checks on rules of origin between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  The EU and the UK have agreed on a set of measures to ensure that there would be a level playing field between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  Certain elements, such as the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code, will continue to apply to Northern Ireland, ensuring that Northern Irish businesses will not be subject to restrictions when selling into the EU&rsquo;s Single Market. They will also be aligned with a limited set of rules related to the EU&rsquo;s Single Market that are essential to avoiding a hard border. This includes elements related to legislation on goods, SPS checks, agricultural controls and VAT and excise in respect of goods.</p>  <p>  This meets the commitments given by the UK last December that, in the absence of a full agreement to avoid a hard border as part of the future relationship, the UK would maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and Customs Union necessary to protect the all-island economy, North-South Cooperation and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Let me be clear. We hope this backstop is never needed, but its inclusion is a necessary insurance policy to guarantee that a hard border never returns to the island of Ireland.</p></reply>

We liaise very closely on agricultural issues with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his officials.As regards the movement of animals and agricultural products between North and South, the backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement agreed on 14 November at negotiator level and endorsed by the British cabinet provides for the necessary regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU on those elements of the EU Single Market relevant to the avoidance of a hard border. They includes sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls, and rules on agricultural production and marketing.</p>  <p>  With regard to the future EU-UK relationship, both the EU and the UK have identified cooperation in the area of agriculture and trade in agri-food products as important aspects of the future trading relationship. Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including in the area of trade, and in particular as regards agriculture and trade in agri-foods. This will be a priority for us in negotiations on the future relationship.

These provide for the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric or psychological disorders through to counselling and critical incident stress management.</p>  <p>  Defence Force personnel preparing for deployment overseas undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and provide for their protection.  As part of the mission readiness process, all such personnel are provided with briefings by qualified PSS staff, on Critical Incidents and their effects along with stress management and wellness.  Personnel are also issued with the Defence Force guide to Critical Incident Stress Management which provides useful information including how to manage stress associated with such incidents.</p>  <p>  In response to any significant operational incidents at home or overseas, PSS personnel trained in Critical Incident Stress Management are deployed to provide both one-to-one and group psychological support.  In addition, prior to deployment, PSS trains a cross section of personnel in Critical Incident Stress Management Peer Support which enables them to provide initial psychological support (Psychological First Aid) to any personnel who may be affected by a traumatic incident. Such support would include normalising the reactions, enhancing individual stress management and where appropriate referral of personnel to additional resources such as the unit medical officer.</p>  <p>  Defence Force personnel have, both while on a tour of duty and following their return home, access to a Primary Carer Medical Practitioner, either military (Medical Officer) or civilian (GP), whose role it is to assess, diagnose, treat and refer individuals as necessary. Personnel experiencing psychological issues are referred by their Primary Carer for psychiatric and psychological assessment and treatment with onward referral to an external civilian service provider, as required.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these measures provide comprehensive supports to individuals in the Defence Forces who may require them, and I can assure the Deputy that all such supports are kept under review.</p></reply>

I, as well as officials from my Department, remain in ongoing contact with representatives from EU Member States, the Commission and Task Force, and the UK.</p>  <p>  Monthly meetings of the General Affairs Council (Article 50) are an opportunity for me to bring Ireland&rsquo;s interests and concerns directly to both my EU counterparts, and to the Commission Task Force. Yesterday I attended the GAC (Article 50) in Brussels where my counterparts and I discussed last week&rsquo;s announcement of the agreement between the negotiating teams.  I have attended the GAC (Article 50) on a monthly basis, most recently on 12 November, and 16 October. On each of these occasions, I met separately with Michel Barnier and I also met briefly with a range of EU colleagues. </p>  <p>  Over the past six months, I met with many of my counterparts on a bilateral basis, both in Ireland and abroad. This includes Heiko Maas, my German counterpart, who I met en marge of the German Ambassadors&rsquo; Conference in Berlin in August, and my Estonian, Lithuanian and Finnish counterparts in September. More recently, I have held bilateral meetings with the Polish Foreign Minister and European Affairs Minister, as well as Jean-Yves Le Drian, my French counterpart last month. </p>  <p>  In all my meetings, I have been struck by the solidarity and unity of our EU partners with Ireland on the issue of the backstop. As part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, we have a legally operable guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. This would not have been possible without the unity and understanding displayed by our fellow EU27 Member States, as well as Michel Barnier and his team. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, my officials are in frequent contact with both their counterparts in EU Member States and institutions, as well as with the EU Task Force. Officials from my department, attend the Coreper (Article 50), as well as regular working group meetings, with officials from relevant Government Departments, which deal with the negotiations and brexit preparations.  </p></reply>

On 14 November, the British Government decided that the draft Withdrawal Agreement, with the outline of the political declaration, was an acceptable basis on which to proceed.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship. This will form the basis for negotiations after 29 March. We are committed to working with the UK, and our EU partners, to secure a future relationship that is as deep and comprehensive as possible.</p>  <p>  An extraordinary European Council Summit will be held on 25 November so that the Agreement, together with the political declaration, can be endorsed.  This is a very significant and welcome breakthrough in the Brexit process.</p>  <p>  EU and UK negotiators have worked intensively over a long period to achieve this, and should be congratulated and thanked for their work. In particular, Michel Barnier and his team, have demonstrated extraordinary commitment and understanding. This outcome would not have been achieved without the unity and solidarity of our EU Member States and institutions.</p>  <p>  The draft Agreement, notably the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, meets Ireland&rsquo;s objectives.</p>  <p>  It protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process. Importantly, nothing in the Agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  </p>  <p>  It translates the UK&rsquo;s political commitment to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland into a legal guarantee. It provides for a &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; that will apply unless and until another solution is agreed. This means that there will be no hard border in any circumstances. </p>  <p>  It underpins, in a dynamic way, continuing North/South cooperation and the all-island economy.</p>  <p>  It provides for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, ensuring that the arrangements by which Irish and British citizens can live, work and access services in each other&rsquo;s countries will continue into the future. </p>  <p>  It protects the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity and confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens. It provides for a period of transition, which can be extended, in which preparations can be made for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  While this is an important achievement, there is still considerable work to be done. Once the European Council has given its endorsement to the Agreement, it will be for the British and European Parliaments to consider and approve it according to their respective procedures. </p></reply>

The absence of the Executive also means that that North South Ministerial Council cannot meet. </p><p>I am currently engaging with Secretary of State Bradley on how both Governments can most effectively secure the full operation of all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>I met with Secretary of State Bradley in Dublin on 17 September, in Belfast on 8 October and most recently in Dublin on 2 November at the British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference.  I spoke further with the Secretary of State by telephone on Monday 12 November.</p><p>In my discussions with Secretary of State Bradley, I have underlined the Government&rsquo;s deep concern at the continuing impasse with the devolved institutions, which she shares.</p><p>I have also set out the Government&rsquo;s view that the legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election underlines the seriousness of the absence of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, and the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p><p>Secretary of State Bradley has confirmed that this legislation is temporary and time-bound and that it operates to provide the necessary scope to get the institutions back in place.</p><p>Secretary of State Bradley and I have in this context reaffirmed the strong determination of both Governments to get the devolved institutions up and running again.  We are agreed that a new political process is required to secure the necessary agreement between the parties that will see the Assembly and Executive operating again on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>Both Governments are continuing to engage with all of the political parties to seek a way forward.  All parties have re-affirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and have provided views on their key concerns and issues. </p><p>I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a way forward, but I continue to believe that a resolution is possible. </p><p>The calls from across all sections of the community in Northern Ireland for the devolved institutions to operate have to be heeded.</p><p>The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

It is an arrangement that is valued on both islands and the continuation of this arrangement is a stated objective of both the Irish and UK Governments.  In the context of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, it is important that any arrangements necessary to maintain the Common Travel Area are put in place. </p>  <p>  The Common Travel Area provides for associated rights and entitlements which enable Irish and UK citizens to move freely between and reside in both jurisdictions.  These rights and entitlements include access to employment, healthcare, education, and social benefits, as well as the right to vote in certain elections. </p>  <p>  The CTA agreements have existed for over 95 years without a formal agreement but through a combination of legislative provisions and policy measures.  Despite the lack of formal arrangement, the CTA has endured and proven to be flexible and adaptable.  The CTA is recognised in EU law by Protocol No. 20 to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>  <p>  Article 5 of the Draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, within the draft Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK published on 14 November 2018, and agreed at negotiator level, is a translation into legal terms of the acknowledgment between the EU and UK negotiators made in their joint report of December 2017 that the UK and Ireland may &ldquo;continue to make arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of persons between their territories&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The maintenance of the CTA is a bilateral matter.  Work is ongoing both with the UK and domestically at official level to ensure that the necessary provisions are made in both jurisdictions so that the CTA continues to function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.  The UK Government has committed to updating domestic legislation, as necessary, to ensure that the agreed CTA rights and privileges are properly reflected.</p>  <p>  While domestic work on the CTA is being coordinated by my Department, all relevant Government Departments are examining the legislative changes, if any, which may be required to ensure that the CTA continues to operate in their respective policy areas. Ireland will undertake all the work necessary, including through legislative provision to ensure that the CTA is maintained.</p></reply>

This is a priority for the Government given its importance for Irish exporters and importers as a means of access to the rest of the single market, in particular with regard to agri-food products. This is an important issue with regard to protecting the competitiveness of our producers and ensuring continued unhampered access to the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  To this end, I welcome the UK&rsquo;s formal notification to the European Commission of its intention to join the Common Transit Convention. The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Travel Convention will play an important role in ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s access to other EU Member States via the UK landbridge.</p>  <p>  Work on is being taken forward in two strands. The first is through the Article 50 negotiations. In the mandate provided to the European Commission by the EU27 in May 2017, it was agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would take account of Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including the transit of goods (to and from Ireland via the UK).  </p>  <p>  The importance of maintaining the landbridge has been recognised and agreed through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement which reaffirms the commitment of the UK to facilitate the efficient and timely transit through the UK of goods moving from Ireland to another EU Member State or another country, or vice versa.</p>  <p>  The second strand is our work with the European Commission and other affected Member States (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s day-to-day role is limited to adjudicating on prisoners' access to the separated regime which separates paramilitary prisoners from the rest of the prison population, as well as loyalist prisoners from republican prisoners.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the Stocktake of the 2010 agreement between the NI Prison Service and the prisoners in the separated regime at Maghaberry was published in November 2014. It made a number of recommendations to be implemented within a period of six months.   At the time, the Government&rsquo;s strong view was that the full implementation of the Stocktake report offered an opportunity to create a conflict-free environment in the prison.  This view was conveyed to the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms. Theresa Villiers MP, to the then Minister of Justice in the Stormont Executive, Mr. David Ford MLA, and to their officials.   </p>  <p>  My officials at the Belfast Secretariat continue to engage on an ongoing basis with a range of parties including the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (ICRC), and others to discuss, explore and encourage progress. In recent months, officials from the Belfast Secretariat have met with members of the Education and training provision review for separated prisoners. In addition, a senior official from the Secretariat recently met the governor of Maghaberry and discussed a range of issues. </p>  <p>  Officials remain in contact with the Criminal Justice Inspectorate for Northern Ireland whose most recent report on conditions in the prison, issued in August 2017, noted that health and educational provision is improving and that levels of disorder and violence were generally low.  That report also found that there were still significant challenges around the separated regime, and officials have continued to monitor developments.</p>  <p>  In seeking satisfactory outcomes in Maghaberry, the cooperation of both the Northern Ireland Prison Service and the prisoners themselves is required. I would encourage all with influence to move forward in the right spirit.  The restoration of the Executive at Stormont and the appointment of a new Northern Ireland Minister for Justice would also be of great assistance in addressing the issues facing Northern Irish prisons. </p></reply>

On 14 November, Prime Minister May and her cabinet indicated that, for the British Government, the draft text of the Withdrawal Agreement is an acceptable basis on which to proceed.</p><p>This is a very significant and welcome breakthrough in the Brexit process.  </p><p>EU and UK negotiators have worked intensively, with great commitment and professionalism over a long period to achieve this. </p><p>There is no &lsquo;good&rsquo; Brexit for Ireland. We deeply regret the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave, however much we respect that decision. For us, the objective with Brexit has always been to minimise the damage and to lay the best possible groundwork for the future.</p><p>Even in the best possible agreement, it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU, and that will bring change. However it was and continues to be absolutely necessary that any change that did occur would not result in a hard border on the island of Ireland. </p><p>This Withdrawal Agreement does that. It also underpins, in a dynamic way, continuing North/South cooperation and the all-island economy.</p><p>It provides for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, ensuring that the arrangements by which Irish and British citizens can live, work and access services in each other&rsquo;s countries, will continue into the future. </p><p>It confirms that people in the North will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens.</p><p>It provides for a period of transition in which all of us can prepare for the new relationship between the EU and the UK, following the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>In addition, the Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland and North South cooperation will continue in a range of important areas. </p><p>While this is an important achievement, there is still considerable work to be done. </p><p>President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has called an extraordinary European Council Summit for 25 November so that the Agreement can be finalised and formalized.</p><p>It will then be for Westminster and the European Parliament to consider the agreement according to their respective procedures.</p><p>None of this can be taken for granted. </p><p>This is an important step, but only a step on a much longer journey. It is important for us to secure the deepest and most comprehensive relationship possible with the UK following its withdrawal from the EU. It is only through that relationship that we can secure the trade and other interests that are important to Ireland, the UK and our EU partners. We are absolutely committed to working closely with the UK, and our EU partners, to achieve that end.</p></reply>

Some examples of these campaigns have included the Online Passport Renewals Service and a &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; initiative. A public information campaign to promote awareness of Government-wide supports and resources that are available to assist with Brexit preparedness is also currently being coordinated by my Department.</p><p>In the time available it has only proved possible to gather information requested by the Deputy for the period 2016-to date.  Details of relevant advertising campaigns carried out during this timeframe are as follows.</p><p><b><i>2018</i></b></p><p><b>Online Passport Renewals Service</b></p><p>In 2018 we have concentrated on highlighting the Online Passport Renewal Service as a fast and secure way for adults to renew their passports. Specific activities have included advertisements in local publications throughout the country and on social media platforms, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations. The direct costs of advertising to raise public awareness in this regard are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b><font color="#2F2F2F">Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe </font></b></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Against the background of debate which is underway at EU level and beyond about how best to address the challenges of a rapidly changing the world, and in cooperation with European Movement Ireland, my Department hosted a series of &lsquo;Citizens Dialogue on the Future of Europe&rsquo; events throughout spring 2018. These events took place in Galway, Cork, Donegal, Kildare, Meath and Dublin and enabled citizens to share ideas and priorities on the future of Europe and on such themes as the economy, security, social responsibility and globalisation.</font></p><p>To raise awareness of these opportunities for citizens to engage with and attend these events, my Department undertook a communications campaign that included advertisements in local papers and on local radio in each of the locations concerned. The direct costs of this advertising are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council</b></p><p>On 2 July 2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online and the direct costs incurred in  this regard are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Public Consultations on I</b><b><font color="#2F2F2F">nternational Development Policy</font></b></p><p>A public consultation process in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy took place in 5 locations around the country over the period July &ndash; October 2018. The goal of the process was to hear the views of the public on how Ireland&rsquo;s international development policy can contribute towards meeting the ambitious objectives of such initiatives as the 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals agreed by the United Nations in 2015. To raise awareness of these opportunities for the citizens to engage and attend these events, my Department undertook a communications campaign that included advertisements in local papers. The direct costs of this advertising are set out in Table 1.</p><p><b>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;</b></p><p>The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep the Irish public fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. </p><p>The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>My Department is also coordinating a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.  This campaign has updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as public workshop events which were held over successive weeks throughout October. A programme of awareness raising via web and social media platforms and radio and print media advertising also took place. </p><p><b><i>2017</i></b></p><p><b>Online Passport Renewals Service </b></p><p>In 2017 to coincide with the launch of the online adult passport renewals facility, my Department advertised in order to ensure awareness by citizens of this innovative service.</p><p>The advertising in question took the form of a multi-format outdoor transport campaign combined with digital units in Dublin and Belfast Airports to promote the online passport service. The outdoor transport campaign ran over two two-week cycles in May and June<font color="#004080"> </font>2017. The digital units in Dublin and Belfast Airports ran from May to August. In addition to the outdoor campaign, a further online and social media campaign was also run with ads being placed around digital articles and social media activity on travel-related themes. This part of the campaign ran from April until August of 2017. </p><p><b><i>2016</i></b></p><p><b>TravelWise App</b></p><p>In 2016, my Department launched the <i>TravelWise</i>smartphone app to help Irish people traveling abroad to stay safe and informed while traveling, living or working overseas.  <i>TravelWise</i>makes all of the Department&rsquo;s travel advice available to citizens offline and in their pockets as well as being a valuable messaging tool for use by our Consular Service during a crisis situation overseas.

This conflict actually began, in March 2011, as a result of popular revulsion against the mistreatment of people in custody.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU have repeatedly condemned violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in Syria, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. Ireland has called on numerous occasions for the situation in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that a hunger strike began in Hama Central Prison on 12 November. The same prison was reported to be the site of conflict in 2016 when hundreds of detainees were reported to have protested over the transfer of prisoners to the notorious Saydnaya prison near Damascus, where they expected to be sentenced to death by an extra-judicial military tribunal. </p>  <p>  It has been reported that the current hunger strike was commenced by prisoners in protest of death sentences issued against them by the Assad regime. Ireland is opposed to the use of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances. Accordingly, Ireland, together with the rest of the EU, seeks the universal abolition of the death penalty.</p>  <p>  I unreservedly condemn any violation of the human rights of prisoners, and call on all parties to the Syria conflict to ensure protection of human rights. The EU has made very clear, over a period of many years, our strong condemnation of all the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Assad regime. The regime is in no doubt about the strength of our views. </p></reply>

Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).   </p>  <p>  The criteria for selection for OSCE election observation missions is exactly the same as applied in all observation missions, which was set out in the Information Note for Applicants accompanying the call for applications to join the Election Observation Roster established in 2013. </p>  <p>  For each election observation mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers, all roster members are invited to express their interest in the mission with a view to ensuring the widest possible participation. A shortlist is drawn up based on the specific criteria set out by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience, language proficiency, gender and length of time since serving on a mission.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate new observers or observers with limited experience.

Ireland works closely with EU and UN partners in the multilateral fora to monitor non-compliance with international human rights standards.</p>  <p>  Ireland frequently raises issues of human rights abuses, in a national capacity, through the human rights mechanisms of the UN including the Human Rights Council and Universal Periodic Review in Geneva and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York. At the most recent session of the Human Rights Council, in September 2018, Ireland made a national intervention during the Interactive Dialogues with the Commissions of Inquiry on Syria and South Sudan. During this session, Ireland also expressed concern over the ongoing situation in Yemen and South Sudan in our statement during the Item 4 General Debate.</p>  <p>  During the most recent session of the Universal Periodic Review, which concluded last week in Geneva, Ireland made two recommendations to all fourteen countries under review. Countries under review included Senegal, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Chad and Congo. Recommendations covered issues such as eradication of Female Genital Mutilation, LGBTI rights, human rights defenders, sexual violence, the death penalty and freedom of association and assembly. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly believes in the importance of multilateral engagement, both in a national capacity and through the EU. Ireland inputs into EU policy through meetings of the EU Working Party on Human Rights in Brussels and coordination with the EU Delegation in New York and Geneva. At the current session of the UN General Assembly in New York, the EU delivered a statement on behalf of all member states on &ldquo;Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives&rdquo;. This statement made reference to a number of country specific human rights situations including in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen. During the 39th session of the Human Rights Council, the EU also delivered a statement during the Item 4 General Debate.

The violent events in recent months have clearly demonstrated the risks of the continued political vacuum. Ireland has worked consistently to maintain an international focus on the issue, and support for the two state solution.</p>  <p>  The EU remains firmly committed to a two state solution to the conflict. With the prospects for peace continuing to deteriorate on the ground EU Foreign Ministers have discussed the Peace Process on numerous occasions over the last year, most recently at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in August. There we considered how the EU can productively engage and better use all the levers at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. We must ensure that the EU&rsquo;s support for the region is focused on delivery of the two-state solution.</p>  <p>  However, there is also great concern among EU colleagues about threats to the viability of that solution, stemming principally from the settlement policy of the Israeli Government. The Middle East Peace Process has been effectively stalled for four years now. </p>  <p>  Along with other EU colleagues I have sought to encourage and influence the United States in its current consideration of a Middle East initiative, so long as it addresses the needs of both parties to the conflict. And I have indicated my intention to hold an informal ministerial meeting in Ireland, for a small number of Arab and European Foreign Ministers. I believe this style of gathering could be useful in promoting the exchange of ideas on how to restart the stagnated peace process.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance programme is focused on delivering our goals of reducing poverty and hunger, promoting inclusive and sustainable growth and building more equitable and better systems of governance.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is delivered through a wide range of partners and channels, including partner government systems, Irish and international Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionary organisations, and UN and other multilateral agencies and organisations.  Throughout, the ability of these funding channels to reach the poorest and most fragile countries and regions in the world, and deliver real results on the ground, is at the forefront of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement. In this way, Ireland is playing a strong role in supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.  </p><p>The Irish Aid Annual Report 2017, published on 2 October last, indicates that last year Irish bilateral assistance reached 87 of the world&rsquo;s underdeveloped countries. Irish assistance is given in support of countries&rsquo; development needs, typically in response to their poverty reduction strategies, and through the provision of humanitarian assistance in response to emergencies and protracted crises.  Sub-Saharan Africa remains our priority focus, where we direct assistance to the poorest communities, delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture, and food production. This focus is reflected in the adjudication in September by the Overseas Development Institute in the UK that Irish Aid is the world&rsquo;s most efficient donor at targeting extreme poverty.</p><p>We have a particularly strategic input into poverty reduction in countries in Africa where we have a resident embassy &ndash; particularly Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania Uganda, Zambia - allowing Ireland to play a key role in their long-term development.  A similar strategic role is played by the Embassy to Vietnam.  Smaller more focused programmes are delivered in countries and territories such as Zimbabwe, South Africa, Liberia, Kenya and Palestine. </p><p>Our bilateral assistance is complemented by our engagement with UN and multilateral agencies whose core mission and objectives are closely aligned to Ireland&rsquo;s aid priorities, allowing us to work with and support vulnerable communities across most developing countries. A total of 143 countries received Irish support channelled through the multilateral system. A full list of all of the countries and multilateral agencies receiving ODA from Ireland is reflected in Irish Aid&rsquo;s annual report, which is available at: <i>.</i></p><p>A key principle underpinning Irish development cooperation is that it should remain untied - that is, not conditional on acquiring goods and services from Ireland.  This is regularly positively remarked upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee in their regular assessments of Ireland&rsquo;s international development cooperation and humanitarian programmes. Untying aid &ndash; removing the legal and regulatory barriers to open competition for aid-funded procurement &ndash; increases the effectiveness of aid by reducing transaction costs and improving the ability of partner countries to set their own course. Ireland is leading the way in this by making its bilateral Official Development Assistance 100% untied. </p><p>For example, Ireland has been to the forefront in encouraging the EU and its Member States to untie more of their aid. Progress is being made. The proportion of EU and Member States&rsquo; aid that is untied now stands at over 80%. The European Commission has increased its share of untied aid from 48% in 2010 to 72% in 2016. We will continue to encourage further progress in that regard and maintain our international record of keeping our ODA 100% untied.  </p></reply>

OCHA coordinates and leads coherent and effective international responses to humanitarian crises.  Amongst other funds, OCHA manages the Central Emergency Response Fund, which responds to sudden onset disasters and to under-funded crises.  Ireland is a strong supporter of both mechanisms and the current chair of the OCHA donor support group, which works with the Office the UN Humanitarian Coordinator. In 2018 OCHA has assisted millions of people affected by natural disasters around the world, including the response to the earthquake in Indonesia, drought in Afghanistan, and floods in Nigeria. </p>  <p>  Ireland also works closely with the ICRC and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The IFRC is the world's largest humanitarian organisation, comprising 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent member societies, and reaches 160 million people annually through 17 million volunteers, members and staff. Ireland is providing &euro;1.85 million to the Federation in 2018 to support its coordination of relief operations to assist victims of natural disasters, including those affected by the recent devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia.</p>  <p>  Ireland also works with our NGO partners in order to provide rapid assistance following natural disasters. For example, in response to the eruption of the Fuego Volcano in Guatemala on 3 June 2018, Ireland provided &euro;75,000 to Plan International to assist with shelter for those affected. </p>  <p>  As well as responding quickly and effectively in the event of a disaster, it is also important to work with countries to build up their resilience to disasters. Ireland provides core support to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction worth &euro;0.5m to help them build capacity in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries to prepare for and manage the impact of disasters.</p></reply>

These events that have led to the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and the wounding of very many more, were senseless and avoidable.I have given a high priority to the Middle East conflict since I assumed office, and discuss it regularly with my European colleagues, as well as with my Israeli and Palestinian counterparts during my visits to the region. I have given particular priority to the situation in Gaza, which I visited most recently in January of this year.    Following the horrific events of 14 May 2018 in Gaza, I summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Iveagh House to convey the Government&rsquo;s view that the actions by Israeli security forces were unjustified and unacceptable. I made clear, as I have done publicly, that Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself did not justify these actions. </p>  <p>  I also raised Gaza with my EU counterparts, at the Foreign Affairs Council in May. I stressed the need to find practical ways to begin to ease the situation there, and to provide hope for an end to the cycle of recurring violence. Once again, we reiterated our commitment to reviving the political process, along the lines of the two- state solution. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, Ireland and other states requested the calling of a Special Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva to discuss these events. At that session, Ireland co-sponsored a motion in which the Human Rights Council set up a commission of inquiry into what happened. Ireland also supported a resolution at the UN General Assembly in New York which called for examination of means of protecting Palestinian civilians.</p>  <p>  Ireland has worked consistently, particularly at EU and UN level, to encourage international attention to focus on the long running and worsening problems in Gaza, and the need to end the restrictions imposed by Israel which have a debilitating effect on the population, as well as the need to end rocket fire, shootings, and other violence in both directions. </p>  <p>  I have met the new Israeli Ambassador and raised with him my increasing concerns about the effects of the ongoing occupation of Palestine. I will continue to raise my concerns at every appropriate opportunity.</p>  <p>  I have replied separately to other Questions today about the exchange of fire across the Gaza border, which took place in the last week.</p></reply>

The Embassies of Ireland in Nairobi and Abuja actively monitor the situation on the ground, and feed into Ireland&rsquo;s effective advocacy within EU and UN forums.</p><p>In addition, Ireland works with a broad range of partners to coordinate our collective humanitarian response so that those affected can be most effectively protected and assisted.  In this regard, Ireland this year is making a particularly important contribution, through our chairing of the OCHA donor support group which assists the UN Humanitarian Coordinator.  So far this year, Ireland has provided over &euro;4.8 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region and &euro;5.5 million in humanitarian funding to Somalia.  In addition, Ireland is also the 7th largest donor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  CERF has this year allocated &euro;14.9 million to Somalia, as well as a further &euro;22.9million to the Lake Chad basin. </p><p>Ireland and the EU are strong and consistent supporters of the work to build peace and stability in both the Lake Chad region and Somalia.  The EU has contributed up to &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce which promotes regional security in territories affected by Boko Haram.</p><p>The EU provides considerable support to the UN mandated AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to combat the serious threat posed by Al-Shabaab, and also to reinforce the establishment of Somalia&rsquo;s government institutions. This is in addition to EU support for capacity building operations in the areas of maritime law enforcement and training.</p><p>Ireland is working with both EU and UN partners to implement a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of radicalisation in both regions. This includes the promotion of peace and giving people access to decent work and livelihoods, including via the EU&rsquo;s <i>Instrument contributing to Peace and Stability</i>(IcSP) and the <i>EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa </i>(EUTF).</p><p>The appropriate international forum for determining whether a prosecutable crime has been committed would be the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  The Office of the Prosecutor determines whether a situation meets the legal criteria established by the Rome Statute to warrant investigation.  </p><p>As Nigeria has deposited its instrument of ratification to the ICC, the Court has jurisdiction there.  On 12 November 2015, the Office of the Prosecutor identified eight potential cases involving the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes under articles 7 and 8 of the Statute that form the subject of an ongoing admissibility assessment, including six for conduct by Boko Haram and two for conduct by the Nigerian security forces.  </p><p>The ICC does not currently have jurisdiction in Somalia.</p></reply>

The Government is determined to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, are protected for people on the island of Ireland, North and South.   In this regard, the Government appreciates the solidarity and support which has been shown by all of our EU partners in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns.</p>  <p>  The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland that is part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement published on 14 November 2018, and agreed at negotiator level, reflects the priority that the Government and our European partners have placed on protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. </p>  <p>  Prime Minister May and her Cabinet have indicated that, for their part, the draft text for the Withdrawal Agreement is an acceptable basis on which to proceed towards a meeting of the European Council which President Tusk has convened for 25 November. </p>  <p>  This is a very significant step, one that fully achieves our negotiating priorities for this phase and that reflects the commitments made in the Joint Report between the EU and UK negotiators published on 8 December 2017.</p>  <p>  Through the Protocol, the EU and UK will be protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. Importantly, the draft Protocol makes clear that nothing in this Withdrawal Agreement will affect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  Critically, the backstop arrangements in the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement guarantee that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland in any circumstances.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment that the UK will ensure that there will be no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. The Protocol also recognises that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland are EU citizens and that they will continue to enjoy rights, opportunities and benefits. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Protocol provides that the Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland and that North South cooperation can continue in a range of important areas.</p>  <p>  The Protocol also contains other provisions that address a number of other unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  These include provision for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, a key Government objective in negotiations.   </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage intensively, as appropriate, with the EU and the UK to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to secure the gains and benefits of the Peace Process.</p></reply>

Three years of armed conflict has been the driving force in a devastating, protracted humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  I most recently discussed the situation in Yemen with my EU counterparts at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. [We were all in agreement on the need to continue our strong support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, who is working to bring the parties together for a new round of peace talks which may take place before the end of the year.]  I was heartened to hear of the renewed prospects for negotiations. Work is also ongoing in New York on a UN Security Council Resolution that will hopefully see agreement on a ceasefire and will lay the groundwork for the resumption of peace negotiations.</p>  <p>  While some individual EU Member States have announced decisions to refrain from selling arms and military equipment to members of the international Coalition  , there is currently no consensus at EU level on an arms embargo related to the conflict in Yemen. For now Irish efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of Export Control Regimes and the implementation of the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty.</p>  <p>  The UN plays an important role in delivering and coordinating humanitarian support in Yemen, in facilitating access for commercial goods, in driving forward efforts to resolve the conflict through the work of the UN Security Council and the Special Envoy, and in providing oversight through the work of the Human Rights Council and other human rights bodies.  </p>  <p>  I fully support the efforts of the UN Special Envoy, who is working in very difficult circumstances. To make progress, he requires full cooperation and engagement from all parties to the conflict. He has worked hard since he took up the role in March to make a positive impact, and I hope his latest efforts to restart talks, later this month, will meet with success.  </p>  <p>  The UN is vital to the humanitarian effort in Yemen, playing a leadership role in coordinating assessments of need, and ensuring overall humanitarian coordination to avoid gaps and duplication. Since 2015, Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen, much of which is disbursed via UN agencies, who ensure delivery on the ground. This includes a contribution of &euro;4 million made to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund this year, which provides assistance in the areas of education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health. The UN agencies, along with a small number of international NGOs, are carrying the greatest burden in terms of providing food and basic services for the Yemeni people. </p>  <p>  The United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM) is important in facilitating the unimpeded free flow of commercial vessels sailing to Yemen ports not under the control of the internationally recognized government, namely Hodeidah and Saleef. The EU is now the largest donor to UNVIM.</p>  <p>  The UN Human Rights Council also has a role in highlighting the grave human rights situation in Yemen. Ireland was part of a small core group of countries that drove forward the adoption by consensus of a Resolution at the Human Rights Council establishing a Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) on Yemen. The GEE presented its findings to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in August 2018. While the report noted numerous violations and crimes, the experts indicated that they needed more time to complete their work. In September Ireland worked again with a core group of countries to extend the mandate of the GEE for a year, to allow them to do this.</p></reply>

The section also introduces a new, time-limited, tapered regional uplift for productions in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. This uplift will taper out over a period of 4 years. The uplift will be available at a rate of 5% in years 1 and 2, 3% in year 3 and finally 2% in year four.  The section also provides for a number of administrative changes to ensure the credit operates in an efficient manner. As the film tax credit is a notified State aid, these changes are subject to EU approval and the process of notifying the EU is under way.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Finance Bill 2018 amends Section 128F of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provides for favourable tax treatment of share options granted under the Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP). Under the scheme there are restrictions imposed on the total market value of shares which can be granted by the qualifying company to the qualifying employee. The restrictions are set out in paragraph (d) in the definition of &ldquo;qualifying share option&rdquo; in subsection (1). The amendment changes the restriction applied at employee level, whereby the limit of &euro;250,000 in any 3 consecutive years of assessment is replaced by a life-time limit of &euro;300,000, and the limit of 50% of the annual emoluments in the year of assessment is increased to 100% of the annual emoluments. This relief is also subject to State Aid provisions, although the KEEP scheme overall already has State Aid approval.</p></reply>

I do not propose that the incentive be extended beyond this date. </p>  <p>  The incentive was introduced in Budget 2014, at a time when there was considerable loss of employment within the construction sector, with the aim of stimulating increased activity and boosting employment in the sector.  The objectives for which the scheme was put in place have been fulfilled, and the support is no longer necessary.  </p>  <p>  Also, in light of the current housing supply shortage, and the need to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there is a risk that the Home Renovation Incentive could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The Personal Injuries Commission, which was established on foot of a recommendation of the Motor Report, has itself also delivered two reports which make a further 14 recommendations aimed at positively impacting the overall Irish claims environment.</p><p>Across the reports, legislative steps were recommended in a number of areas. Progress on the legislative measures taken by my Department to date are detailed below. </p><p>- The Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 was enacted in July 2018 as part of the Implementation of the Review of the Framework for Motor Insurance Compensation in Ireland; </p><p>- The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 was published in July and is currently being considered in the Oireachtas.  It is scheduled to undergo Committee Stage on 29 November.  This will also include  proposed amendments to Section 8 and Section 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, following agreement with the Minister for Justice and Equality;  </p><p>- The Insurance Distribution Directive was transposed in June 2018. </p><p>- The Department of Finance is also considering legislative measures in respect of Recommendation 8 of the Motor Report (developing a protocol for policyholders to be notified of claims made against them before settlement) and the equivalent recommendation from the EL/PL Report as this appears the only feasible solution to achieve the recommendation in the absence of an agreement with industry on a protocol. </p><p>- The report of the Cost of Insurance Working Group also makes legislative recommendations addressed to other Departments and Agencies, including: </p><p>- the enhancement of the powers of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, through the PIAB (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018, which completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 8 November; </p><p>- the Central Bank to consider amending the relevant regulations regarding communications between insurers and consumers, with regard to premium information and renewal notice periods.  Consultations have concluded on this and the Bank is finalising its considerations in advance of proposing an amending statutory instrument; </p><p>- the consideration by the Department of Justice and Equality of measures necessary to implement Pre-Action Protocols for personal injury cases; </p><p>- the preparation of criminal justice legislation, if required, by the Department of Justice and Equality, to implement a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database.  It has not yet been established if legislation is required in this regard; and </p><p>- the requirement for insurance companies to provide the driver licence number as part of work to establish a fully functioning database to identify uninsured drivers, through a proposed amendment of the Road Traffic Act 2016, which is currently being considered by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as part of the broader review of the database work.</p><p>Finally, I would note that the recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission, with regard to establishing the Judicial Council, will require the progression of the Judicial Council Bill 2017 through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This Bill, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, is a legislative priority for the Government.  I am informed by the Department of Justice and Equality that the intention is to make significant progress towards the enactment of the Bill by the end of this year.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and his Department are currently examining the form which an appropriate amendment to the Bill would take and the options in that regard.  </p><p>Should the Deputy require further detail on the above, he should consult the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s seventh quarterly update which was published recently and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website:<i> </i></p></reply>

When it comes to climate change that means ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s climate transition is achieved at the lowest possible cost and that it is done so in a manner which is equitable. </p>  <p>  A Carbon Budget places a legal restriction on the amount of greenhouse gas a country or sector can produce in a given time period. The development of specific climate action policies, such as the potential introduction of carbon budget methodologies, is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the first instance. However, a sustained whole of Government approach will be required to enable Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. In this context, the National Mitigation Plan and Minister Bruton&rsquo;s forthcoming multi-annual, all-of-government plan for climate action represent important steps towards mainstreaming the climate change agenda into the policy formulation and decision making processes across all of Government. </p>  <p>  I am, together with my Department, committed to assisting in this transition. My Department is currently undertaking a number of actions in order to help mainstream the climate change agenda into policy formulation and decision making processes across all of Government. For example, my Department is currently reviewing the Public Spending Code to ensure that all Government investment decisions will incorporate an appropriate assessment of the climate consequences of those decisions. I recently accepted an invitation from the OECD to join the Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting. Participation in the Collaborative will help us to integrate environmental and climate outcome based reporting into our annual budgetary processes. This will be an iterative process but, as a first step, this year&rsquo;s Revised Estimates Volume (REV) will include a table on climate related expenditure in a separate section of that report. </p>  <p>  Finally, taxation policy also has an important role in supporting climate change policy. In this regard, there are already several established tax measures which support the reduction in national carbon emissions, in particular the carbon tax, the CO2 based Vehicle Registration Tax, the CO2 based motor tax, tax incentives which incentivise the uptake of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and an Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme which incentivises the uptake of cleaner energy technologies.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that the current suite of environmental taxes continue to play an important role in supporting climate change policy.     </p></reply>

However, on foot of a Government decision of the 22 October 1982 to phase out these schemes, no new appointments were permitted and this decision was conveyed to schools at the time.  While certain vacancies on the schemes were filled in subsequent years, the schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008. </p>  <p>  The original 1978/79 schemes covered a relatively small number of primary and secondary schools and the decision to phase them out was part of a policy decision to spread the support more widely and ultimately cover all primary and secondary schools with funding for such services. Negotiations took place in the context of the introduction of new arrangements for the provision of clerical and caretaking assistance for schools under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  A final agreement was reached between the Department and the unions to allow for implementation of the new arrangements.</p>  <p>  As the 1978 and 1979 schemes were being phased out, they were superseded by these more extensive capitation grant schemes.  Under these schemes, the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools in the Free Education Scheme now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services. Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using capitation grant assistance. In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  I am personally very much aware of this as an issue and the important role that School Secretaries and Caretakers play in the running of schools.  </p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment and in consultation with the NCSE. </p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.</p><p>The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>There are 3 special schools and 66 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Tipperary. Of these, 8 are ASD early intervention classes, 32 are primary ASD classes and 18 are post primary ASD classes.  The number of ASD special classes in Co. Tipperary have increased from 10 in 2011/2012 to 58 in 2018/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on  <i>www.ncse.ie. </i></p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year in Co Tipperary, and where special provision is required it is planned and established to meet that need.  I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need in the Clonmel and Cahir areas to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  My Department has no role in making determinations in this area. </p></reply>

I understand that in the case of catholic schools, the Catholic Schools Partnership subsequently published guidelines for catholic schools in relation to the inclusion of all pupils and that this also contains suggestions on how such schools can manage the "opt-out" of religious education. </p>  <p>  These are important steps, which alongside the circulars published earlier this year by my Department for state multi-denominational schools, help to inform parents in an open and transparent way how their requests to have their children opt out of religious instruction are handled by schools.</p></reply>

There are a number of actions under NTRIS aimed at improving traveller participation and engagement in schools nationwide.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality and Tusla Educational Welfare Services in progressing a pilot programme which, if successful, will inform the development of a sustainable programme to address the gap in educational outcomes for children and young people from the Travelling and Roma communities in other regions including Limerick.  </p>  <p>  A key objective of Traveller education policy in recent years has been the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision and the inclusion of Traveller children and young people in mainstream education.  Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, DEIS Plan 2017 which was launched by my Department in June 2017 includes a number of specific actions to improve educational outcomes for Traveller children and young people in the education system.</p>  <p>  The provision of learning support following the removal of the Resource Teachers for Travellers (RTT) posts meant that Primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources to support children who require additional learning support provision through the General Allocation Model (GAM). Post-primary students, formerly supported by RTT hours, access the learning support service.  </p>  <p>  A number of schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) scheme had smaller class sizes as a result of enhanced Pupil Teacher Ratios.  Up until 2011 Traveller pupils attending a DEIS school, but who were supported by an RTT, were not counted as part of the valid enrolment for the implementation of the enhanced pupil teacher ratios.  When the Traveller pupils were no longer supported by RTTs, the compensatory measure proposed for DEIS schools was to apply the DEIS Band 1 pupil teacher ratios to include Traveller pupils, for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools.  There is one post primary school with a Learning Support post in Limerick and there are 5 alleviation posts in Limerick. </p></reply>

It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.  Therefore it is important to understand that the demographic of neighbouring schools will not necessarily be the same and can indicate different levels of disadvantage based on the actual pupil cohort in each individual school. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i></i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses.  Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using capitation grant assistance.  In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  I am personally very much aware of this as an issue and the important role that School Secretaries and Caretakers play in the running of schools.</p></reply>

My Department works very closely with the Department of Health in promoting the 'Healthy Ireland' agenda in schools and is represented on the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group and the National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group.</p>  <p>  Schools and the wider education sector have a vital role to play in contributing to the Government's 'Healthy Ireland' agenda.  </p>  <p>  All schools are required to deliver physical education as part of the curriculum.  Healthy lifestyles guidance was issued to all schools and was developed in consultation with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. It aims to support and strengthen schools efforts in developing in young people the skills and attitudes needed to make informed decisions about their health.</p>  <p>  Through their primary and post primary education students are equipped with the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make healthier life choices. Schools' efforts should be complemented by students' families and their community. </p></reply>

This work is ongoing at present.

This work is ongoing at present.

In terms of providing upgraded court accommodation the refurbishment, extension and development of existing courthouses has always been the Courts Service's preference. However, while this is an option for Tralee, the scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow. Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard. The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review. </p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that the Chief Executive of the Courts Service has recently met with the Chief Executive of Kerry County Council in Tralee to discuss the future provision of court facilities there.</p><p>A number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 -2027. They include:  </p><p>- Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, <b>Tralee</b>and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam; </p><p>- Regional Family Law Centres; </p><p>- A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective. </p></reply>

The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of Special Education Needs. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders was published in July 2016.</p><p>In the course of preparing the advice, the NCSE consulted widely with a range of stakeholders including parents, teachers, academics, experts, psychologists, HSE officials and others.</p><p>The NCSE also reviewed relevant national and international research.</p><p>The Policy advice, which is available on the NCSE&rsquo;s website, includes a review of the July Provision scheme.</p><p>The NCSE review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides day-time respite for families and a structured day for students.  However, the NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>This include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The NCSE advised that in general, the scheme is not meeting its original objective which was to reduce possible regression in academic learning.  </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down syndrome.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and representatives from other Departments and agencies to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.</p><p>There are no plans to change the July provision scheme coverage until this work is complete. </p></reply>

In terms of providing upgraded court accommodation the refurbishment, extension and development of existing courthouses has always been the Courts Service's preference. However, while this is an option for Tralee, the scope for refurbishing and developing the existing courthouse on Ashe Street to provide the envisaged accommodation is extremely limited due to the nature of the building and the constrained nature of the site.</p><p>The Courts Service has also advised that it is currently considering a number of options for Tralee Courthouse, including the level of extension and refurbishment achievable within the confines of the existing courthouse site; whether it would be feasible to acquire an adjacent town centre site and the degree of extension and refurbishment this would allow. Previous efforts to acquire adjacent sites on Ashe Street have not been successful as the sites could not be acquired at a price that represented value for money. A further option is to build a new modern courthouse on a greenfield/brownfield site and a number of potential sites are being considered in this regard. The Courts Service has informed me that a decision has not yet been made and that all options are under review. </p><p>The Courts Service has further advised that the Chief Executive of the Courts Service has recently met with the Chief Executive of Kerry County Council in Tralee to discuss the future provision of court facilities there.</p><p>A number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 -2027. They include:  </p><p>- Further new or refurbished courthouses in regional cities and county towns where facilities remain substandard (including Galway City, Wicklow Town, Portlaoise, <b>Tralee</b>and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Clochan Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht court for the region, and Tuam; </p><p>- Regional Family Law Centres; </p><p>- A nationwide condition survey of all court buildings in the estate will be undertaken to determine their condition and identify works required in relation to any issues identified and meet ongoing maintenance requirements.</p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective.</p></reply>

INIS plans to continue these measures at least until December to ensure demand is met.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, I am advised that over 9,600 people were registered with INIS in Dublin in the month of October &ndash; up significantly on the September figure.  I am further advised that to the end of October in excess of 67,000 persons have been registered this year in Dublin representing an increase of 7.5% on the same period  for 2017.  INIS expects to register over well over 80,000 people in Dublin this year.</p>  <p>  Appointments are made available twice daily with over 400 per day released for booking.

My Department received formal legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General earlier this month.  The advice is comprehensive in nature and is now being carefully considered by my officials, together with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the context of road traffic legislation.  It will also be necessary to consult again with other relevant Government Departments and public bodies via the cross-agency forum established by my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to provide any further details in relation to the legal advice until such time as these consultations are concluded.  </p>  <p>  The consultations that my officials are engaged in include participation in a Taskforce established by South Dublin County Council to consider the public order implications of the misuse of these off-road vehicles at a community level.  The Taskforce has met on three occasions to date, most recently on 14 November 2018.  The Taskforce is a useful and important forum and, indeed, Taskforce discussions informed the Department&rsquo;s correspondence with the Office of the Attorney General. </p>  <p>  Arising from the Taskforce meetings, the road safety officers from each of the Dublin-based local authorities have agreed to organise a public awareness campaign, urging parents not to purchase scramblers and quad bikes as Christmas presents for minors.  In addition, the Road Safety Authority launched a related road safety campaign on 14 November 2018.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to closely monitor the consultations that are taking place concerning the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.</p></reply>

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of the availability of resources and his identified operational demands.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the estimated full year cost to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of employing an additional 18 senior crime and policing analysts at HEO level is approximately &euro;1,042,000.  The estimated annual salary costs of an additional 18 crime and policing analysts at EO level is approximately &euro;753,000.  These calculations are based on the mid-point (excluding long term increments) of the Higher Executive Officer and Executive Officer pay scale currently in effect from 1 October 2018 and including an estimate of Employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  </p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties.  The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs</p><p>The Garda strength by Station and Rank for the D.M.R.

These measures have unfortunately impacted the Limerick-based company Aughinish Alumina (AA), which is owned by one of the sanctioned Russian firms.</p>  <p>  The Government has been working hard, ever since the sanctions were announced, to help find a solution. We have been in regular communication, particularly through our Embassy in Washington, with the US about the particular issues facing AA. This included letters from myself, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister Donohoe to our respective American counterparts. Ministers of State Pat Breen and Patrick O'Donovan also travelled to Washington in July to meet with the relevant US authorities, as well as members of Congress, to underline the importance of this for Ireland.</p>  <p>  We remain, of course, in close contact with AA itself about the situation. The Taoiseach and Tanaiste have both met with the firm's senior management and Minister of State Breen and I have also been heavily engaged. At official level, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continue  to work very closely together on this, with officials from both in regular contact with the company.</p>  <p>  As regards wider international engagement, the Government has consulted with the European Commission, who understand fully how important AA is to the Mid-West of Ireland and the Irish economy. We are also working together, both in Brussels and on the ground in Washington, with other affected EU Member States in order to achieve a positive outcome.  </p>  <p>  The Government welcomes the most recent extension of a licence deadline - which effectively allows AA to continue to operate despite the sanctions - by the US authorities to 7 January 2019. We hope that this additional time will now facilitate a definitive resolution of the issues in a way that safeguards AA's future and protects jobs at the Askeaton facility. We will continue to do everything we can to secure such an outcome.</p></reply>

This includes a goal of increasing investment in every region of Ireland by 30%-40%.  Real progress is being made towards that objective.

It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p><p>The Government has taken a number of positive steps to increase FDI in the regions and the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme is important in encouraging more FDI into regional locations. As part of Budget 2019, I was pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of that Programme on top of the &euro;150m that was announced when it was launched in 2015.

Ireland continues to perform very strongly in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and encouraging further investment from multinational companies is a major priority of mine.  I am pleased to say that there are now over 210,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies here, the highest in the State's history.  </p><p>However, we must recognise that global competition for FDI is increasing all the time, and we must therefore work harder than ever to retain and promote our competitive advantages and to secure new investment projects.  That means improving, if possible, on our already compelling and attractive offering for multinationals to invest here. The IDA is authorised by my Department to provide a range of financial supports in the form of employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants. These grants are an important means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations.  </p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of grants paid by IDA Ireland to its client companies between 2013 and 2017. The figure provided for Dublin includes payments to the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT). Grant payment figures are released on an annual basis and I have been informed by the IDA that information on the total of grants paid to client companies in 2018 will be made available once they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. </p><p>It is important to note that grants paid in a particular year are not necessarily linked to either the investments won or the jobs created in that 12-month period. Grants are generally drawn down over the lifetime of a project which is normally over a period of three to five years. Some investments which result in job creation may not be grant aided and some well-established firms may no longer be receiving grant payments.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;5,093,152</td><td>&euro;72,000</td><td>&euro;2,027,393</td><td>&euro;1,080,631</td><td>&euro;82,725</td><td>&euro;8,355,901</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;120,622</td><td>&euro;418,271</td><td>&euro;64,180</td><td>&euro;603,073</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;3,172,202</td><td>&euro;4,463,951</td><td>&euro;3,023,557</td><td>&euro;2,521,600</td><td>&euro;13,181,310</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>&euro;12,380,130</td><td>&euro;18,353,580</td><td>&euro;13,260,876</td><td>&euro;13,220,973</td><td>&euro;20,843,403</td><td>&euro;78,058,962</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;3,071,490</td><td>&euro;1,889,800</td><td>&euro;1,697,150</td><td>&euro;685,500</td><td>&euro;1,602,200</td><td>&euro;8,946,140</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>&euro;24,803,491</td><td>&euro;19,952,938</td><td>&euro;19,826,741</td><td>&euro;20,136,706</td><td>&euro;19,949,601</td><td>&euro;104,669,477</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>&euro;17,277,141</td><td>&euro;8,422,227</td><td>&euro;18,357,383</td><td>&euro;13,611,022</td><td>&euro;7,681,690</td><td>&euro;65,349,463</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;584,145</td><td>&euro;16,800</td><td>&euro;3,220,609</td><td>&euro;1,024,766</td><td>&euro;2,357,952</td><td>&euro;7,204,272</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;4,690,248</td><td>&euro;728,457</td><td>&euro;5,798,570</td><td>&euro;3,573,544</td><td>&euro;2,096,053</td><td>&euro;16,886,872</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;350,000</td><td>&euro;440,000</td><td>&euro;156,000</td><td>&euro;946,000</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;25,000</td><td>&euro;75,000</td><td>&euro;5,000</td><td>&euro;24,500</td><td>&euro;129,500</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;4,434,483</td><td>&euro;15,374,032</td><td>&euro;10,596,531</td><td>&euro;13,589,484</td><td>&euro;7,036,757</td><td>&euro;51,031,287</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;397,750</td><td>&euro;169,542</td><td>&euro;3,297,973</td><td>&euro;3,865,265</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;2,935,800</td><td>&euro;3,672,307</td><td>&euro;993,000</td><td>&euro;3,031,765</td><td>&euro;924,060</td><td>&euro;11,556,932</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;4,180,577</td><td>&euro;6,376,253</td><td>&euro;2,406,422</td><td>&euro;1,498,389</td><td>&euro;3,184,082</td><td>&euro;17,645,723</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;1,540,920</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;300,000</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;1,840,920</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;58,022</td><td>&euro;200,000</td><td>&euro;200,000</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;458,022</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;150,042</td><td>&euro;324,662</td><td>&euro;120,000</td><td>&euro;355,540</td><td>&euro;960,089</td><td>&euro;1,910,333</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;110,000</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;733,000</td><td>&euro;0</td><td>&euro;185,500</td><td>&euro;1,028,500</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;796,831</td><td>&euro;750,892</td><td>&euro;4,229,218</td><td>&euro;922,814</td><td>&euro;2,875,340</td><td>&euro;9,575,095</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;2,729,055</td><td>&euro;3,654,309</td><td>&euro;2,939,811</td><td>&euro;2,580,100</td><td>&euro;3,428,740</td><td>&euro;15,332,015</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;1,938,976</td><td>&euro;1,867,329</td><td>&euro;1,341,864</td><td>&euro;10,914,081</td><td>&euro;7,794,598</td><td>&euro;23,856,848</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;272,624</td><td>&euro;1,948,923</td><td>&euro;2,513,508</td><td>&euro;1,768,687</td><td>&euro;2,078,588</td><td>&euro;8,582,330</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;934,569</td><td>&euro;783,794</td><td>&euro;1,534,136</td><td>&euro;568,307</td><td>&euro;1,473,521</td><td>&euro;5,294,327</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;27,623</td><td>&euro;43,738</td><td>&euro;234,048</td><td>&euro;159,372</td><td>&euro;321,734</td><td>&euro;786,515</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>&euro;87,951,297</td><td>&euro;87,487,265</td><td>&euro;97,737,583</td><td>&euro;92,978,051</td><td>&euro;90,940,886</td><td>&euro;457,095,082</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-11-20a.751.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000080#WRN02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331, 333, 335 and 336 together.</p>  <p>  Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borelliosis) is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from infected ticks and is the commonest cause of tick-borne infections in Europe.  Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borreliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination which may be carried out by a General Practitioner.  Lyme disease may also be treated by infectious disease specialists (of which there are 12 nationally) or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals.  Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.  The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  The membership of the Subcommittee included a person nominated by Tick Talk Ireland to represent its views during the Subcommittee&rsquo;s deliberations. </p>  <p>  The Subcommittee will shortly submit its final report to the SAC.  During the report&rsquo;s preparation, the HPSC learned that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK was undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease which resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guidelines.  These guidelines are based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to diagnosis, management and public awareness of Lyme disease.  </p>  <p>  Given the significance of the NICE guidelines to the subject-matter of its work, the Subcommittee determined that it would be appropriate to delay finalisation of its report with a view to ensuring that the findings of these guidelines could be taken into consideration and to ensure that no relevant evidence regarding Lyme disease would be omitted.  In considering the NICE report, the Subcommittee focused solely on the evidence and recommendations contained in the report that related to its remit (specifically in relation to awareness-raising - diagnostics and clinical management aspects fell outside the remit of the Subcommittee).  </p>  <p>  The report is scheduled to be finalised by the Subcommittee shortly, at which point it will be sent for consideration to the SAC.  At this juncture, it would be inappropriate to consider making changes to the testing, treatment and/or management of the condition until this deliberative process has been completed.  However, I have been advised that the report of the subcommittee will be recommending the formation of a group of clinicians to review evidence regarding the diagnostics and clinical management of Lyme disease in Ireland as part of its report. </p>  <p>  Outside of the work of the Subcommittee, the HPSC website (hpsc.ie) provides extensive information on Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites for both the public and General Practitioners.  Lyme disease can be successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the characteristic rash (Erythema Migrans) that sometimes accompanies infection with Lyme disease and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  Lyme disease can, however, be a difficult diagnosis to make in cases where there is no evidence of a rash.  It should also be noted that the symptoms associated with Lyme disease are also characteristic of other conditions such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, food poisoning, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Depression and Multiple Sclerosis. </p>  <p>  The infection can, however, be confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.  This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test.</p></reply>

Given the current status of the ICD-11 codes, it would be premature to comment upon their future implementation or any human rights implications with regard to their application at this stage of their development and roll-out. </p>  <p>  In the interim, Lyme neuroborreliosis was (for the first time) on 28 June 2018, included on the list of diseases under EU epidemiological surveillance, with a uniform EU case definition being formally released at the same time.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) will shortly move to adopt this case definition for surveillance of Lyme neuroborreliosis in Ireland.  The choice of Lyme neuroborreliosis as the notifiable entity for Lyme surveillance in the EU was based on scientific advice provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) after following wide consultation with experts in all EU Member States.  As well as enabling Ireland to have a robust and reliable method to monitor Lyme disease, by adopting the EU case definition, Ireland's data will become directly comparable with data from other EU member states.</p>  <p>  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  This two tier approach gives a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All testing in Ireland is confirmed by RIPL.  </p></reply>

As a candidate country, Ireland was not notified, due to confidentiality arrangements, that negotiations were occurring for the reimbursement of nusinersen and we were not party to the negotiations and proceedings that occurred. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The Act specifies the criteria for making reimbursement decisions, which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the reimbursement of nusinersen in July 2017.</p>  <p>  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a health technology assessment on nusinersen and did not recommend its reimbursement at the submitted price.  </p>  <p>  The application is being considered by the Rare Diseases Medicinal Products/Technology Review Committee and the HSE Drugs Group and is due to be considered by the HSE Leadership Team shortly, following which the final decisions will be notified.  </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to protracted deliberative processes, which are usually bound by strict confidentially clauses at the insistence of applicant companies.</p></reply>

It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. </p>  <p>  Sub-groups on Reformulation and on Healthy Eating have been established as initial priority areas for action. Work has commenced on a Roadmap for Reformulation of foods and drinks to reduce sugar and fat content.</p>  <p>  In addition, a voluntary code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. This Code was published in February and work is underway to operationalise it.  </p>  <p>  The OPAP recommended that proposals be developed relating to the rollout of evidence based fiscal measures, including a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, in support of healthy eating. As the Deputy is aware the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1st of May. It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity. In addition, the development of legislation for calorie posting to support people to make healthy choices is underway by the Department of Health. Currently, a behaviour study on how best to make the posting of calories meaningful to customers and more likely to impact on their behaviours is being finalised.</p>  <p>  A HSE national Clinical Lead for Obesity was appointed in 2017. This appointment will be important in further advancing the implementation of many of the recommendations in the OPAP including the development of a national integrated service model for the health and social care of overweight and obese people and for developing quality assurance guidance for obesity services. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the broader Healthy Ireland agenda, a number of other major initiatives support the Obesity Policy:</p>  <p>  - The National Physical Activity Plan is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  - The Healthy Ireland 2018 Communications campaign aims to encourage people to make a small, healthy change under three themes &ndash; Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Mental Wellbeing, and we are working with a range of national and local partners to deliver a range of communications and citizen engagement activities.</p>  <p>  - The Healthy Ireland Fund, which was initiated in 2017 has supported a range of actions at both national and local level, which aim to support the Obesity Policy and the Physical Activity Plan.</p>  <p>  - A national Healthy Workplace Framework is in development, in conjunction with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and a range of other stakeholders. This Framework, which is expected to be published in 2019, will support and foster initiatives to promote employee and workplace health and wellbeing within both public and private sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, the question of targeted programmes along the lines suggested by the Deputy are matters for those Departments concerned in the first instance.</p></reply>

In addition, some minor procedures were undertaken in Hospital 1 Merlin Park. In March 2018, remedial work facilitated the opening of one theatre at Merlin park and this facility provides access to approximately 10 theatre sessions per week and 44 cases per week. Prior to the closure, the Hospital advises that there were 14 staffed sessions per week and approximately 66 cases per week. </p>  <p>  Merlin Park University Hospital further advises that they have not referred patients to other hospitals during the closure as they were able to transfer patients to UHG for a limited period and are now using the one operational theatre. Further, when the leak occurred in September 2017 there were 95 patients with dates for surgery whose surgeries were subsequently deferred and then listed in accordance with the availability of elective theatre sessions in UHG. The impact of the closures has been that approximately one third fewer elective operating cases have taken place year on year, with 3,466 cases undertaken from September 2016-2017, and 2,377 cases undertaken from September 2017-2018. </p>  <p>  Merlin Park University Hospital advise that they are working towards restoring the full elective orthopaedic service as quickly as possible. The Hospital has also gone to tender for a modular theatre facility which would provide 2 replacement theatres and facilitate 20 sessions per week.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drug schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal to the MMP, making a clear clinical case for the patient.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The outcome of an application or an appeal for reimbursement of lidocaine patches is a matter between the MMP and the treating clinician.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

It provides an update on all 48 recommendations as outlined in the Plan and progress achieved.</p><p>One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise, nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p><p>In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks (ERNs) during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in ERNs.  Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan.  Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place.</p><p>The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan.  The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers.  The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland.  Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU.  The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line (a Freephone service) and provides online information about rare diseases on .</p><p>A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan.  One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme.  The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee and Dr Michael Barry has been appointed as committee chairperson.  A first meeting has taken place and membership of the Committee includes two public/patient representatives from a selected panel of three.  The Rare Diseases Medicinal Products/Technology Review Committee is responsible for:</p><p>1. Reviewing proposals received from industry or expert groups in Ireland for funding of new products for rare diseases, or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases and making recommendations as to the implementation of the relevant recommendations from the National Rare Diseases Plan 2011-2018; and</p><p>2. Providing contributions to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products (OMPs) and supporting the implementation of guidelines in conjunction with the National Drugs Management Programme Office where applicable.</p><p>This Committee will also be supported by the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases Clinical Advisory Group.</p><p>The national plan for rare diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.  The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE.  The Patient Safety Bill 2018 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website: .</p><p>Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals.  The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.  The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals.  These modules are available on: .</p><p>The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings.  It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.  A public consultation was held on the Draft Model of Care, the results of which are currently under consideration.</p><p>The National Clinical Programme has developed a Model of Care for Transition from Paediatric to Adult Healthcare Providers in Rare Diseases.  This has been now finalised and approved by the Clinical Advisory Group.</p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan continues to be implemented.  It recommended that an Oversight Implementation Group of relevant stakeholders, including patients' groups, be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the plan&rsquo;s recommendations.  This group was established by the Department of Health in 2015 and has met on a number of occasions.</p><p>While the current National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland will continue to be implemented, as part of its Work Programme for 2019 my Department is considering how best to take forward the next phase of the Plan.</p></reply>

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  As the Mobility Allowance is paid by the Health Service Executive (HSE) I have referred this question to the HSE for a direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on medicine reimbursement. As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to the reimbursement of medicines. </p>  <p>  After receiving market authorisation and in line with the 2013 Act, a company which would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE must submit an application for reimbursement approval.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland. However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions in place and must also recognise the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that, at the recent bi-annual meeting between my Department and the Irish Healthcare Pharmaceutical Association, this proposed dialogue was discussed. It is envisioned that this will take the form of a structured platform of engagement, building a stronger partnership between the State and industry to create better patient access to new treatments.</p>  <p>  The challenge of securing affordable access to innovative medicines is not unique to Ireland. Over the past two years, my officials and I have been engaging with a number of voluntary EU forums in an effort to identify solutions to issues of medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p>  <p>  On 22 June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy with Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for  patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  The Beneluxa Initiative will have an important role to play in securing faster access to innovative medicines and will provide important platforms to deliver  the shared objective of securing access to high cost, innovative treatments at affordable prices.</p></reply>

Within this context, the HSE requested singular integrated winter plans from Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations in June 2018.  Subsequently in September and October 2018, I met with Hospital Groups and Community Health Care Organisations to discuss their plans for winter preparedness. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan 2018/19, which is currently under consideration by my Department, provides for a 4-week enhanced focus period from 17 December 2018 to 13 January 2019, targeting 9 key sites of concern.  University Hospital Limerick has been identified as one of these 9 sites, based on performance in previous winters. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, an additional &euro;10 m in funding is being provided in 2018 for social care measures to enable older people to leave hospital and return to a more appropriate care setting, including their own home, as quickly as possible with the supports they need.  The HSE has confirmed that measures to support older persons transition from acute care to the most appropriate setting have been identified and that the 2018 initiatives have now commenced.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have asked the HSE to ensure that the National Service Plan 2019 provides for a significant uplift in activity across acute, primary and community care,  to manage critical demand pressures, most particularly on Emergency Departments, at the beginning and the end of the year.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  In order to determine how much an applicant will contribute to the cost of their care, a financial assessment is carried out by the HSE which takes account of a person's income and assets.  As part of this assessment, the HSE identifies any income or assets that the applicant and his/her partner may have deprived themselves of in the five years leading up to their application, or at any time on or subsequent to the date on which the application for financial support under the Scheme is first made.  Such assets are defined in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 as 'transferred assets' and 'transferred income'.  Under the legislation there are no exemptions in relation to transferred assets.</p>  <p>  Where a person is aggrieved by a decision of the HSE, they may appeal that decision no later than 40 working days after notice of the original decision was given.  An appeal must be made in a form specified by the HSE and must state the reasons for the appeal.  An appeal may be made in respect of, amongst other things, a determination of an application for State Support, i.e. section 11 (1) of the NHSS Act 2009.</p>  <p>  As an element of this question is in relation to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy on this element as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Respite beds offer additional assistance to families and carers thus helping to alleviate the ongoing stress associated with providing care. The provision of respite can often assist with avoidable acute hospital admissions.</p><p>There are in the region of 2,000 &ldquo;short stay&rdquo; public beds nationally with a budget of &euro;212 million approximately. This includes step-up, step-down care, intermediate care, rehab and respite care comprised of a mixture of the following categories:</p><p>- Palliative</p><p>- Respite</p><p>- Rehab Specific</p><p>- Convalescent</p><p>- Dementia Respite</p><p>- Assessment beds</p><p>- Transitional care beds.</p><p>These beds are interchangeable for use depending on demand in the centres and so the number of specific respite beds in any one month can fluctuate up and down.</p><p>The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that all persons ordinarily resident in the country are eligible, subject to certain charges, for public in-patient services. In-patient services are defined as institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto.  </p><p>Within this overall definition of in-patient care, a person may be eligible for acute in-patient care in circumstances where in-patient services are provided in a hospital for the care and treatment of patients with acute ailments to a person requiring medically acute care and treatment. </p><p>The definition of &ldquo;in-patient services&rdquo; covers a range of services which may include respite care provided or funded by the HSE in residential accommodation (other than in the person&rsquo;s own home).  </p><p>In this context, whether respite care services for older persons falls within the definition of in-patient or acute in-patient services depends on the setting in which the service is provided and the type of service provided.</p><p>A person in receipt of acute in-patient services is liable, subject to a number of exemptions, for the statutory acute in-patient charge, currently &euro;80 per day for a maximum of 10 days in any period of 12 consecutive months.</p><p>In non-acute residential support service settings, an obligation to pay contributions towards maintenance and accommodation costs applies under section 67C of the Health Act 1970.  This includes non-acute residential respite care services provided by the HSE or by agencies funded to provide such services on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004. These contributions apply to the maintenance and accommodation elements only of such services. There is no provision for free days in each 12 month period. However, a threshold provision means that contributions are payable on a given day if the person has received 30 or more days of residential support services during the immediately preceding 12-month period. </p><p>A waiver system is in place to ensure that each service user's maintenance and accommodation contribution is based on what he or she can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances. </p><p>The HSE publishes detailed supporting documentation in relation to long stay residential support services maintenance and accommodation contributions on its website at  www.hse.ie/longstaycontributions.</p></reply>

This Plan will contain a range of measures across hospitals, primary care and community care settings to manage critical demand pressures during winter to ensure that the system is working at full capacity throughout busy periods.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, &euro;10 million has been made available to the HSE for the winter period for home care packages and other supports to minimise delays in people getting home from hospital, with a focus on those in the over 75 age group.  An additional &euro;10m has been provided in 2018 to anticipate and manage critical demand pressures on the health service and Minister Harris has requested the HSE to prioritise social care measures, with a focus on measures to support older people to transition from acute care to the most appropriate setting. The Social Care measures to be included in the winter 2018/2019 plan are currently being put into place.</p></reply>

It is comprised of representatives from the following Departments and Agencies: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Department of Children and Youth Affairs; Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; Department of Education and Skills; Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government; University College Cork; the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; the Health Service Executive (HSE) - including the National Clinical Lead for Obesity; and Safefood. </p><p>Sub-groups on Reformulation and on Healthy Eating have been established as initial priority areas for action. Work has commenced on a Roadmap for Reformulation of foods and drinks to reduce sugar and fat content.</p><p>In addition, a voluntary code of practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship has also been developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments. This Code was published in February and work is underway to operationalise it.  </p><p>A Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax commenced on the 1<sup>st</sup>of May this year.</p><p>New Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid resources have been published, and widely disseminated, including to all primary and post-primary schools. In addition, new Nutrition Standards for the School Meals Scheme have been introduced. </p><p>Work has commenced on developing Healthy Eating Guidelines for the 1-5 year old age group, which will be a valuable resource for parents and carers in the future. In the HSE the Healthy Eating Active Living programme is supporting work in the education sector, as well as with parents, families and communities in delivering a more co-ordinated approach to prevention and early intervention in child obesity. </p><p>This includes a five-year communications campaign, called START, which is being delivered in collaboration with the HSE and Safefood, with a focus on supporting parents make healthy choices around food and activity</p><p>A HSE national Clinical Lead for Obesity was appointed in 2017. Health assessments (including weight checks) were introduced in the GP under-6s contract. The HSE is also implementing a national Breastfeeding Action Plan which is very important and relevant to this topic.</p><p>Finally, under the broader Healthy Ireland agenda, a number of other major initiatives support the Obesity Policy:</p><p>- The National Physical Activity Plan is one of the key developments arising from Healthy Ireland, and implementation of that Plan is well underway in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of other stakeholders.</p><p>- The Healthy Ireland 2018 Communications campaign aims to encourage people to make a small, healthy change under three themes &ndash; Healthy Eating, Physical Activity and Mental Wellbeing, and we are working with a range of national and local partners to deliver a range of communications and citizen engagement activities.</p><p>- The Healthy Ireland Fund, which was initiated in 2017 has supported a range of actions at both national and local level, many of which are targeted at children and which aim to support the Obesity Policy and the Physical Activity Plan.</p></reply>

This central authority will be complemented in time by regional integrated care organisations which will operate with appropriate operational autonomy within defined geographic areas and with clear reporting structures and will deliver almost all services at regional and local level.  These organisations will build on excellent work to date in the development of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. This has brought about positive change, but the fact that they are not aligned and are separate management structures impedes the kind of integrated planning and delivery unpinning the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy sets out the steps to be taken to achieve these new structures. A public consultation on the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and CHOs took place earlier this year, and I expect to bring proposals to Government on this in the near future.  Over the coming period, work will also begin on defining and agreeing a new organisational and operational structure for the future reconfigured health service, including respective roles of the Department of Health, the HSE and national and regional integrated care organisations. Ultimately this will lead to legislation for the revised health structures, putting them on a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, I decided to await the Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s recommendations before proceeding with the hospital trust process, and consequently, we have incurred no costs on this.  Under the Sl&aacute;intecare proposals, there would no longer be a requirement to establish trusts. </p></reply>

Such consignments will require SPS checks to be carried out at a designated border control post, following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and after the transition period. Rosslare has been identified as a port where SPS checks will need to be carried out. Work is underway, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works (OPW), to identify a suitable site for the construction of a border control post (BCP) at Rosslare Port.

On receipt of this payment application, an assessment of the plantation was carried out by the relevant District Inspector. A series of shortcomings in relation to adherence with the scheme&rsquo;s silvicultural requirements was identified as part of the inspection and was communicated to the person named and their forestry company in December 2017 for remedial action to be completed no later than by 26th July 2019. The remedial works required were not related to any flooding incident, but were solely related to silvicultural requirements that apply to the afforestation scheme.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, the applicant&rsquo;s forestry company informed my Department that all remedial works had been completed. A subsequent assessment was carried out by the District Inspector in October 2018. The Inspector advised that the site was not up to the required silvicultural standard and that there were still remedial works outstanding to be carried out. My Department informed the applicant and his forestry company of the outstanding remedial works on 7th November 2018.</p>  <p>  The Afforestation Scheme Terms and Conditions specify that second instalment grants will be paid only when the entire plantation is up to the required standard.  If part of the plantation fails inspection, payment may be withheld on the entire area until the remedial works are carried out and the plantation established. In addition, the Terms and Conditions also set out that the 7th and all subsequent annual premium payments must be withheld until the second instalment grant has been paid.

The recent Farm Structure Survey found that 55% of farm holders were aged over 55, while just 5% were aged under the age of 35. There are a number of supports provided to young farmers and to support generational renewal.  The National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme under the Basic Payment Scheme were introduced in 2015 to provide financial support to young farmers and new entrants to farming during the crucial early years immediately following the setting up of a farming enterprise. Supporting young farmers and generational renewal will also form an important part of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) post 2020 and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will progress these issues during negotiations on the new CAP proposals.</p>  <p>  There are a number of taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers, the main policy objectives being 1) increasing land mobility and the productive use of land and 2) assisting succession and the transfer of farms. In June 2017, I launched the &lsquo;Succession Farm Partnership Scheme&rsquo;. The Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to assist with the transfers of farms within a partnership structure, promoting and supporting the earlier inter-generational transfer of family farms. It also encourages important conversations within farm families about succession planning. In Budget 2019, I welcomed the renewal by Minister Donohoe of two important young farmer reliefs for the sector:</p>  <p>  - 100% Stock Relief on Income Tax for Certain Young Trained Farmers</p>  <p>  - Stamp Duty Exemption on Transfers of Land to Young Trained Farmers.</p>  <p>  In line with EU state aid requirements, the Finance Bill 2018 limits the amount of aid that can be granted under the various young farmer measures to a lifetime ceiling of &euro;70,000.</p></reply>

In a border context the UK commitment in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland was extremely important. </p>  <p>  At the Government&rsquo;s insistence this commitment has now been translated into legal form in the draft of the Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement fully achieves the objective of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland in any circumstances. Crucially, Prime Minister May and her cabinet have indicated that the draft text of the Withdrawal Agreement is an acceptable basis on which to proceed.</p>  <p>  I, and my Department, have been contributing actively to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - coordinated &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; approach, as well as engaging intensively with our EU counterparts and the European Commission Task Force, to achieve this progress.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government has introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit that will help protect farmers whose farms straddle the border with Northern Ireland. My Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget. In Budget 2018 I, along with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Business and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  In Budget 2019 I made available a Brexit resilience package of &euro;78m. This included a range of measures to support farmers and industry including an increased allocation for farms in areas of natural constraint, the introduction of a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot Scheme, and additional funding for the horticulture sector.  </p>  <p>  To better address the long-term impacts of Brexit and to aid Market Diversification, my Department is supporting Bord Bia in its investment in market insight (through its &lsquo;Thinking House&rsquo;) and in market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. To that end funding to Bord Bia has increased by &euro;14.5m since the UK referendum. As regards Product Diversification, I have provided Teagasc with &euro;8m for the development of a new National Food Innovation Hub in Fermoy. This Hub offers agri-food businesses the opportunity to engage in research activities in an affordable way. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in the border region or in any other part of the country. Although the draft Withdrawal Agreement is a major step in the negotiations, further steps will be needed. The Government has been, and will continue to be, firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances along the border and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a future trading relationship with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangements.</p></reply>

There will be high level meetings with the Commission, the Presidency and other Member States as part of the preparation for the December Fisheries Council and a number of important technical meetings. There are also international negations to be concluded before December, for example those taking place this week in  London on mackerel &ndash; our single most important fishery. </p>  <p>  I engaged with a number of my Ministerial colleagues earlier this week at the Agriculture &amp;amp; Fisheries Council. These meetings help me to understand the priorities of other Member States and also gauge where Ireland can build relationships to help us deliver our priorities at the December Council.  </p>  <p>  My aim in all of these negotiations is always, in consultation with the stakeholders, to ensure that we have a profitable and sustainable fishing industry that will continue to benefit our coastal communities. As part of this, I have also launched a public consultation as part of our Sustainability Impact Assessment and I look forward to the outcome of that process which I intend to lay before the Oireachtas later this month.  </p>  <p>  This year, we are facing and additional challenge with the Landing Obligation - or discard ban- coming fully into force.  Without pre-empting the outcome of the Sustainability Impact Assessment, or going into a stock by stock analysis, it is safe to say that I am concerned about a number of the proposals. Where cuts are justified by the scientific advice I will support them but I must be satisfied that the advice from ICES is being applied correctly by the Commission and in a fair and consistent manner. </p>  <p>  I am always conscious of the immediate impacts the decisions taken at the December Fisheries Council have for so many communities around our coast. This is why I believe the advance preparation should be as comprehensive and inclusive as possible involving my own Department as well as Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute; all industry representatives and the Environmental Pillar. This process is invaluable and helps me identify the key areas of concern.  </p>  <p>  The December Council is always a challenge and this year will be no different. I endeavour to ensure that my direct engagement and that of my officials with the issues concerning fisheries at EU level is as comprehensive as  possible. I can assure the Deputy that Ireland is well prepared and I will do my utmost to ensure that the final outcome is one that is good for the industry and the long term sustainability of the stocks. </p></reply>

On the basis of the provisions of Articles 2 and 9 of the London Fisheries Convention, pre-existing reciprocal arrangements were re-affirmed at the time by means of an exchange of letters in the 1960s between the UK/Northern Ireland and Ireland. The Common Fisheries Policy (Article 5 of Regulation 1380/2013) provides for the continuation of such neighbourhood arrangements. </p>  <p>  On 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen in which it found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law. It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law. The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. </p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements. The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels. If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing. The Bill was published in February 2017, commenced debate in the Seanad shortly thereafter and remains before the Oireachtas.  It is fair to say that considerable opposing views to the Bill have been expressed in debates to date, particularly linking the Bill to Brexit.  In the meantime, access continues to be provided for Irish sea-fishing boats to the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.  </p>  <p>  The UK had initially intimated that it would like to retain the Voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention but had not advanced any legal basis on which they can be retained. More recently, and not surprisingly, the UK has expressed concerns about the unequal situation which currently prevails.</p>  <p>  From the moment the UK leaves the EU, any negotiations on a new Voisinage arrangement would fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union and would be negotiated by the EU with the UK on our behalf.</p></reply>

The 5 reckonable years for payments under the scheme are 2003-2007.     In respect of former fishermen and women who were the holder of a licence or permit in the base year, payment will involve a tax free element for each of the 5 reckonable years for which the applicant was a licence or permit holder.

An application form and detailed information on the scheme can be obtained from any IFI Office or by downloading the relevant documentation from the IFI website www.fisheriesireland.ie. In the interests of simplifying the application process it is not a requirement to submit evidence of eel fishing activity.  The State holds accurate records of commercial public eel licence or an eel fishing permit from the ESB held in the 2007 season.

The strategy is clear that non-renewable energy sources will make a significant &ndash; though progressively smaller &ndash; contribution to our energy mix over the course of the energy transition. </p>  <p>  The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised. During this transition, gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply.   The development of an LNG facility would further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State&rsquo;s commitments to tackle climate change.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.   </p>  <p>  In relation to gas, the production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction is an operational matter for the undertakings involved.  I have no policy remit in relation to the means of energy production in other countries. There is no national legislative licensing requirement to specify from where natural gas should be imported, or how imported gas should be produced.  An LNG facility will have to meet national safety and environmental conditions as well as meeting the gas quality specification for the transmission network as defined in the Code of Operations.</p>  <p>  Final investment decisions for the Shannon LNG project and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoter.  </p>  <p>  On 6 July 2017, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act, 2017 was enacted. The Act amended the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 to provide for the prohibition of exploration for and extraction of onshore petroleum by means of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland, and to provide for related matters.</p></reply>

This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.</p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>There are 135 premises in Ballymore. 2 (1%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention, while 133 (99%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. </p><p>Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to data for Q3 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed almost 210,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. This data is to be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</p><p>eir has indicated to the Department that their deployment schedule has been impacted by storms Emma and Ophelia, and other construction issues. The company has proposed new timelines for its deployment which would see the project completed by mid-2019. Officials from my Department are engaged with eir on this proposal.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, eir is a private company, operating on a commercial basis in a liberalised market. The company&rsquo;s response to queries is a matter for it alone, and not one in which I have any statutory authority to intervene. If, after having exhausted a service provider's complaint handling procedures, a customer is not happy, they may contact ComReg, on 1890 229 668; online at  or by email at Consumerline@comreg.ie, for further assistance and guidance with their issue.</p></reply>

An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions.  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, an additional 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Quarter 3 Progress Report for 2018 will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Some of the Taskforce&rsquo;s achievements to date include:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority.  The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots.  It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas, including County Donegal.</p></reply>

They have, more or less, continued to rise through 2017 and 2018, with UK National Balancing Point day ahead gas prices in September being 57% higher in Euro terms than 12 months earlier. Consistent with the upward international gas price trend, average Irish wholesale electricity prices have also increased.  Consistent with the usual time-lag, the effect of this protracted rise in the wholesale electricity price since end 2016 has been observed in the retail market, with all significant Irish electricity suppliers announcing household customer price increases during 2018.</p>  <p>  Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive.  The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.  The regulation of retail market prices for electricity in Ireland ended in 2011 and for gas prices in 2014. The main thrust of Government policy on energy costs focused on the competitive market and supports for energy efficiency. Government policy has supported competition to drive down prices, and data from approved price comparison sites (www.bonkers.ie and www.switcher.ie) shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). It is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions.       Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which the Minister may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo; to the CRU. The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia restrictions, timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas.  Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which Member States must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressly forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package.  A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered.</p></reply>

This role includes the allocation of radio spectrum and the award of spectrum licences, including any terms, conditions and obligations that may be attached to such licences. ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions, and as such it would not be appropriate for me to comment on specific licence terms and conditions.  I do however recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.   Digital connectivity positively impacts on the lives and livelihoods of citizens throughout the country. In paving the way for 5G deployment in Ireland and future spectrum licence awards, consideration will need to be given to a number of factors, including quality of coverage as well as geographical spread.</p>  <p>  There is currently a number of initiatives underway to help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.  These include the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to alleviate coverage deficits across the country.  A report of a focus group was recently published under the auspices of the Taskforce to provide guidance with respect to categories of locations where high quality, mobile coverage should be made available as a priority.  A pilot exercise has also been completed with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be sued to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.   </p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland. This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Ireland's National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, sets out the sectoral policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as well as taking into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. </p>  <p>  Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that about  &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p></reply>

Ireland currently hosts several global players in the ICT sector and boasts a strong cadre of technology-rich Irish owned enterprises. Acknowledging that data centres, as large consumers of electricity, also pose particular challenges to the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system, the Government Statement recognised these challenges and a  plan-led approach will develop a range of measures to promote regional options for data centre investment, minimising the need for additional grid infrastructure.

While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it will be towards the end of Q2 2019, at the earliest, before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.</p></reply>

Mayo. I would again avail of the opportunity to offer my condolences to the families, colleagues and friends of the four crew members who lost their lives: Capt. Dara Fitzpatrick, Capt. Mark Duffy, Winch Operator Paul Ormsby and Winchman Ciar&aacute;n Smith. I am also acutely aware that Paul and Ciar&aacute;n remain lost at sea. </p><p>The Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) commenced an Investigation immediately upon notification of the accident, and that Investigation is ongoing. The AAIU is the national Safety Investigation Authority for aviation accidents and incidents and while it is located within my Department, it functions independently of me and my Department. Regulations provide for investigations to be held in private and are confidential. The sole purpose of such Investigations is the prevention of future accidents and incidents and not to apportion blame or liability.</p><p>The Investigation has published two reports to date; a Preliminary Report AAIU Report No. 2017-006 published on 13 April 2017, and an Interim Report AAIU Report No. 2018-004 published on 16 April 2018. Both reports are publicly available on the AAIU website, <i>www.AAIU.ie</i>. </p><p>The AAIU&rsquo;s investigation into the causes of the accident to R116 is ongoing. It is charged under domestic Law, EU Regulation and International Convention with examining all relevant issues it determines are pertinent to the occurrence it is investigating. As I have already stated publicly, whilst I understand the on-going public interest in this matter, it is vital that the AAIU is given the time and space to complete its work and report on its findings. As the AAIU is independent in the conduct of its investigations, I do not propose to become involved in individual investigations.  As such, I am not in a position to directly comment further on the issues surrounding it. </p><p>However, on information provided by the Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, I can tell the house that work is progressing towards the finalisation of a Draft Report. Once prepared, the Draft Report will be circulated in confidence to interested parties for comment, a process that will take at least 60 days. The Investigation will then proceed to finalise the Report, taking into account the comments received. Due to the complexity of the work involved, and as the number of comments, which may be received is unknown; it is not possible to be definitive regarding a timescale for these activities.</p></reply>

Such investigations are carried out by external, independent investigators drawn from a panel established by the MCIB for this purpose. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the 2000 Act specifically deals with the composition of the MCIB. The Board consists of five members, three of which are appointed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport. In addition, the Chief Surveyor of the Marine Survey Office is an ex officio member of the board and the Secretary General of this Department, or his or her nominee, is also a member of the board. The current nominee of the Secretary General is the Lead Investigator of the Railway Accident Investigation Unit, which is based in this Department. Prior to this the previous nominee of the Secretary General was the Chief Aeronautical Officer of the Air Accident Investigation Unit, which is also based in this Department. </p>  <p>  The remit of the Board, its statutory powers and its obligations are contained in the 2000 Act. In addition, the MCIB is also subject to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (revised in 2016), which is designed to ensure that State bodies meet the highest standards of corporate governance. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise that the current Chairperson of the MCIB is due to complete her term in January 2019. In this regard, my Department has already begun the process to appoint the next Chairperson. </p>  <p>  On 5 October 2018 the Public Appointment Service (PAS) advertised for the upcoming vacancy on its dedicated website for appointments to State Boards (www.stateboards.ie). In support of this campaign, a comprehensive booklet was produced and published by PAS (in conjunction with my Department) inviting applications from suitably qualified candidates and specifying the particular skills and experiences required of the Chairperson of the MCIB. In addition to the identified key competencies required of the Chairperson, the booklet expressed a desire for applications from candidates with experience or knowledge of marine accident investigation or accident investigation in another sector, or Health and Safety Management. </p>  <p>  My Department hopes to conclude the appointment process shortly and to have the new Chairperson in place by early 2019 to continue to lead the MCIB in its important work. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is anticipated that 2 additional vacancies on the MCIB (including the position of Deputy Chairperson) may arise in 2020. My Department will work closely with PAS at the relevant time to ensure that we attract suitably qualified and experienced candidates who will uphold the required high standards of corporate governance and continue to oversee the effective running of the MCIB.</p></reply>

The transfer of co-ordination of such an incident to IRCG&rsquo;s Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) occurs when the location is confirmed to be offshore or coastal. In carrying out its responsibilities, the MRCC coordinates various SAR assets available to it in consultation with a variety of state and voluntary entities. The transfer of responsibilities from the ARCC to MRCC is managed on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) under the National SAR Framework. The coordination of participants in the search and rescue operation is managed on the basis of standard operating procedures and various MoUs with the entities involved, as specified in the National SAR Framework. </p>  <p>  Once the search and rescue has been completed, the Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) will commence its investigation of the accident under International Convention, EU Regulation and national legislation. These obligations require it to conduct investigations into aviation accidents and serious incidents that occur in the state and its territorial waters, regardless of registration origin. Outside of territorial waters (12 miles) and in international waters, the AAIU is obligated to conduct investigations into aviation accidents and serious incidents that occur to Irish registered aircraft. With regard to occurrences to foreign registered aircraft, outside of Irish territorial waters but close to Ireland, the investigation will be completed by the state of registry and support will be provided by the AAIU if so sought by the state of registry.</p></reply>

These young people are offered a wide range of services from different State actors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education. </p>  <p>  The aftercare provisions of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on the first of September 2017. This means that there is now a statutory obligation on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to prepare an aftercare plan for each eligible child and young person. This plan encompasses the range of supports that a young person may need from all service providers, including Tusla, to help them make the transition to independent adult life. This plan must specifically include consideration of the young person&rsquo;s needs in relation to accommodation. </p>  <p>  The majority of young people who leave the care of the State each year upon turning 18 do so with stable accommodation in place. A significant number of young people leaving care remain living with their former foster carers. Those who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education. </p>  <p>  Tusla does not collate data on the number of young adults discharged from aftercare into homelessness.  Tusla does not operate a policy of discharging young adults into homeless services. </p>  <p>  Of the 1,964 young adults aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of an aftercare service at the end of June 2018, 45.2% were living with their former foster carers, 25.1% were living independently, 10.5% were at home with their birth parents, and 9.3% were in a residential care placement or supported lodgings. </p>  <p>  However, some 9% of young people leaving care are at a more pronounced risk of entering unstable accommodation due to the complexity of their support needs. In recognition of the particularly complex needs of a minority of young people leaving care, they have since 2017 been included for the first time as a separate category for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). CAS will provide targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate care-leavers. My Department and Tusla have developed principles and criteria relating to funding proposals under CAS. Where accommodation is provided under CAS, Tusla will provide and, where necessary advocate for, additional independent living supports, in particular for the most vulnerable care leavers, in accordance with the individual&rsquo;s pre-agreed aftercare plan. I am pleased to be able to confirm that the first two care leavers have now taken occupancy of secure accommodation under the scheme while an additional 43 units, consisting of a mix of one and two bed units across the State, are "Sale Agreed" and should be available for many other young people leaving care in the near future.  </p>  <p>  The security provided by a tenancy in CAS accommodation, combined with the aftercare supports identified by Tusla as part of the aftercare planning process, can help ensure that these young people have a safe base from which to begin their transition to independent adult life.</p></reply>

My officials immediately contacted Tusla, the Child and Family Agency to establish the details of the case. I am pleased to assure you that Tusla have confirmed that they will temporarily extend the young person&rsquo;s current aftercare placement to ensure that she has a safe place to stay.</p>  <p>  According to the information provided by Tusla, the young person in question was due to be discharged from her current placement on Friday 16th November, with the intention that she could move directly to an Aftercare unit run by Focus Ireland and funded by Tusla. Unfortunately, on November 9th, this unit advised that they were not in a position to accommodate the young person due assessed risk.</p>  <p>  Tusla are appealing this decision, and are offering additional support to the unit to manage concerns identified by that service. Due to the particularly complex needs of the young person identifying a suitable adult placement is a challenge. Tusla believe that the unit identified will best meet these needs. A final decision is awaited from the unit. In the interim, as mentioned, the young person can temporarily remain in her current placement. </p></reply>

I renew my call for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, and I note that the Mercer report advises this course of action also. A Sectoral Employment Order offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. My department will readily co-operate with such a process, if and when it is underway.  </p>  <p>  I would not wish to prejudice any future process through commenting on the specific wage levels suggested in this report, but will say again that I welcome all contributions that seek to address quality in Early Learning and Care, and I believe that those working in the sector need and deserve better pay and conditions, especially given the importance of the work they do in supporting children's early learning and development.</p>  <p>  I have supported a range of measures to improve pay and conditions using the tools available to me. In particular, I have introduced additional capitation into funding programmes for early learning and care, including a 7% rise this September in the ECCE capitation rate, as well as Programme Support Payments to recognise the administrative roles that services play. I have also continued to provide a higher rate of capitation payment for graduate-led pre-school rooms, to encourage the attraction and retention of graduates. This year I also introduced a pilot measure for funding services whose staff take part in continuing professional development, and I hope to build on this pilot over the years to come, following an evaluation.</p>  <p>  New data on current wage rates will shortly be available through Pobal's annual sector profile, which will be published later this month, and through the independent review of costs for service providers in the sector, which was commissioned by my Department. The new Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and Families contains significant actions to develop and support a valued early learning and care workforce that will deliver quality services to children in the most important years of their development.</p></reply>

Over the past 2 years there is evidence of positive change in the day to day operations in Oberstown. I have met with young people in Oberstown on a number of occasions in recent months, who were anxious that the many positives about Oberstown be highlighted. Furthermore, the most recent HIQA report also found that improvements were evident. I believe that these improvements have been brought about by the strong leadership of the Chairperson and the Board.</p>  <p>  The Report referred to by the Deputy, relates to a Review that was commissioned by Oberstown Board of Management following a particularly difficult time in Oberstown in 2016. There had been serious incidents involving young people which threatened the safety of the centre.  </p>  <p>  It is imperative that a report of this kind should observe due process and fair procedures, so that all persons referred to are treated appropriately. The Board of Oberstown and I have taken legal advice on the question of publication.   </p>  <p>  Following careful examination, the Board was not in a position to satisfy itself, or myself, that fair procedures had been applied before the report was finalised and submitted. In light of this and the legal advice received, I, following careful consideration of the matter, concluded that it is not appropriate to publish the full report.   </p>  <p>  In addition to this Review, the Board commissioned a number of other reports at the same time, with a view to engaging external expertise to support the development of the Campus. These reviews included security, health and safety and behaviour management.  The Review Implementation Group, which I appointed, began work to oversee all the various recommendations in March 2017. The Group&rsquo;s final report in December 2017 produced a coherent plan to implement all the recommendations.

In early 2019, DCYA will introduce initial SAC regulations which will enable the registration of SAC services, to be followed shortly thereafter by full regulations which will enable inspection. This move is designed to enable school aged children to avail of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) when it is launched in late 2019. A fundamental requirement for access to ACS will be registration with Tusla and for services to be subject to  inspections. In Budget 2019, my Department secured additional funding for Tusla to recruit more inspectors to meet this increased demand. The recruitment process is ongoing and will see the staff in post in early 2019.</p>  <p>  The Early Years and School Age Capital Programmes in 2018 were available to childcare providers looking to expand, repair, maintain or establish a new service. Applications for funding were open from February to March 2018, with the results of the process announced in June 2018. Strand 4 of the programmes was designed to assist new or existing services who were looking to provide additional school age childcare places and strand 5 covered building improvements and maintenance for school age childcare services. The maximum grant available under strand 4 in 2018 was &euro;20,000 with a total of &euro;750,000 awarded to 45 services. The maximum grant available under strand 5 in 2018 was &euro;5,000 with a total of &euro;250,000 awarded to 54 services. The design of 2019's Capital offering is currently on-going, and the details of this will be made available to providers as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are no specific funding streams covering school age children with disabilities. However, following the end of the third programme year of the  Access and Inclusion Model (AIM, which operates in the ECCE / pre-school programme) in mid 2019, DCYA will carry out an evaluation of AIM, and in the light of the evaluation will consider possible extension of AIM to other age groups, such as school age children.</p>  <p>  For any queries in relation to the various schemes run by the Department, the local City/County Childcare Committee is best placed to assist. They are funded by DCYA to provide assistance on all matters related to childcare provision in a given area.</p></reply>

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R.  The review will also help to inform future CL&Aacute;R programmes in 2019 and beyond.  </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding specific areas and measures which might be supported under the CL&Aacute;R programme in 2019 will be made early next year. </p></reply>

In my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development I am absolutely clear on the importance of ensuring that these communities can access the services they need so that they remain vibrant places in which to live and work.</p>  <p>  Investment in rural Ireland is taking place right across Government. The Action Plan for Rural Development is a comprehensive cross-Government plan which sets out a wide range of measures focused on supporting and building sustainable communities; growing jobs and enterprise; improving access to services; maximising tourism, culture and heritage assets; and improving connectivity in rural areas.</p>  <p>  Since its publication, Government departments have been working towards delivery of the measures contained in the Action Plan. The Third Progress Report on the Action Plan is due to be published shortly and I can confirm significant progress continues to be made across the range of measures.  </p>  <p>  Continued implementation of the Action Plan for Rural Development, together with the additional &euro;1 billion investment provided for through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, will bring positive benefits to our rural communities. I expect to be able to announce the first group of projects to be supported by the Fund before the end of this month.</p>  <p>  My Department also administers a range of funding programmes that support local communities throughout Ireland. Of particular importance for those towns and villages most disadvantaged in terms of access to services are the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the funding being provided to our public libraries.</p>  <p>  Additionally, funding delivered through the LEADER Programme and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme provides supports tailored to the specific needs of individual areas.</p>  <p>  The Government is also continuing to explore ways to sustain the viability of the post office network into the future. Last month, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment launched a new Digital Assist pilot initiative with An Post. Ten locations across the country will act as pilots for the provision of new services and I am delighted that my Department has been able to provide funding of &euro;80,000 for this programme. The first unit has been unveiled in Ballymore Eustace post office in Co Kildare.</p>  <p>  In terms of directly facilitating access to services in rural Ireland, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has provided a funding allocation of &euro;14.9 million for local link services in 2018. Such funding facilitated 1.9 million passenger journeys last year &ndash; providing a vital service for rural communities. </p></reply>

Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance scheme to include people on short term payment schemes such as jobseekers benefit would require additional funding for the scheme, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a recipient of a social welfare or health service executive payment who has exceptional essential heating costs due to ill health or infirmity and who cannot provide for such costs from within his or her own resources may qualify for a heating supplement.  There is no standard rate for a heating supplement.  Each case is examined on its merits and the Community Welfare Officer determines the amount to be paid taking account of the level of the expenses in question and the ability of the applicant to contribute towards his or her exceptional heating costs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the house hold benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;182 million in 2018.  Household benefit applicants aged 70 or over do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria or undergo a means test.</p><p>The fuel allowance payment is targeted at those who are more vulnerable to energy poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  Disablement benefit is not included among those payments, as it is not means-tested and it can be paid to people in full time employment.  Allowing all persons over 70 years of age in receipt of social protection payments regardless of means to receive the fuel allowance would also fundamentally change the nature of the scheme and add significantly to its cost.</p><p>Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance scheme to include people who are in receipt of disablement benefit and for all people age over 70 who do not satisfy the means test would require considerable extra funding for the fuel allowance scheme<b></b>and would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.  The appropriate levels of welfare support including eligibility for fuel allowance will be considered by the Government during budget negotiations, with due regard to the available resources.</p><p>In 2016 the Government launched a comprehensive Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty following extensive public consultation.  This Strategy is spearheaded by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency, and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  The Warmer Homes Scheme, administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, is designed to do that.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive.</p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in the coming weeks, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in early 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The Scheme enables local authorities to provide home loans in accordance with the criteria set out in the Regulations and the Statutory Credit Policy issued in accordance with them.  The Housing Agency has been given the task of carrying out assessments of the loan applications on behalf of the authorities and making recommendations in respect of each application.</p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister's power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions should not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  Therefore, I am precluded from intervening in relation to individual cases.</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations it is a matter for each local authority to make the decision on loan approval applications.  Under the Statutory Credit Policy each authority must establish a Credit Committee to consider these applications on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the Statutory Credit Policy and  having regard to the recommendations of the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The Statutory Credit Policy also obliges local authorities to establish an appeals process to which applicants, who are dissatisfied with a decision of a Credit Committee, may appeal that decision.  It is therefore open to the persons referred to by the Deputy to make such an appeal.  Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p><p>Housing authorities submit funding proposals for individual Traveller-specific projects and developments on an annual basis.  These projects are assessed on a case-by-case basis in my Department in advance of allocations being made.  In addition, further funding may be considered by my Department throughout the year in the light of progress across the programmes generally.  There is regular contact between my Department and housing authorities in order to try to ensure maximum progress and drawdown.</p><p>All applications for funding are dealt with on receipt.  The timeline for assessment of Traveller-specific accommodation can vary considerably depending on the type of accommodation being developed or refurbished.  Traveller-specific accommodation varies from Group Housing Schemes, to Halting Sites with demountables, to provision of emergency mobile homes, to major and minor refurbishments and extensions of existing accommodation.</p><p>In the main, proposals for Traveller Accommodation are approved.  However, on occasion projects may require clarification or revision based on assessment by my Department.  There is no formal appeals process as my Department works successfully in collaborating with local authorities to bring projects to completion.</p><p>In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, and reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawdown in recent years, the Housing Agency, in 2017, commissioned a review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation to date.  This review had regard to targets contained in local authority TAPs and actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.</p><p>Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee recommended that an Independent Expert Group be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  That Expert Group has now been established and has been tasked with reviewing the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and all other legislation that impacts the delivery of Traveller Accommodation.  I have asked the Expert Group to bring forward recommendations that will improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally.</p><p>My Department will consider any recommendations made by the Expert Group that improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally and help to ensure that full use is made of the increasing level of funding available for investment in Traveller accommodation.</p><p>The amount of funding approved and drawn down by housing authorities for Traveller-specific accommodation from 2015 to 2018 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th></th><th><div>Allocation</div></th><th><div>Drawdown</div></th><th><div>Allocation</div></th><th><div>Drawdown</div></th><th><div>Allocation</div></th><th><div>Drawdown</div></th><th><div>Allocation</div></th><th><div>Drawdown</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>2018</div></td><td><div>to date 2018</div></td></tr><tr><td>County Council</td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td><td><div>&euro;</div></td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td><div> </div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>          130,000 </div></td><td><div> </div></td><td><div>          207,905 </div></td><td><div>            71,450 </div></td><td><div>            167,740 </div></td><td><div>                -

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.  There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway and the Household Means Policy is being reviewed as part of this process.  The Housing Agency is continuing to carry out the detailed statistical work, which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. </p>  <p>  The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

At the moment there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 218 fire stations nationwide, with local authorities expending approximately &euro;280m per annum on their fire services. </p>  <p>  The most recent review of fire services in Ireland resulted in the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; (KCS) in 2013. This was the report on the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011/2012, and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland. </p>  <p>  At national level, a National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was created within my Department in 2009 to give central direction and leadership for the fire and emergency management services. The 2009 arrangements put in place a management structure at central government level with a clear mandate and visibility to develop national policy and to drive consistent achievement of quality fire services by local authorities, while not interfering with existing local political accountability for front-line service delivery. Under the system, responsibility for the day-to-day operation of fire services remains with the local authorities. However, the National Directorate&rsquo;s mandate includes developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.</p>  <p>  The KCS policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire and, for the first time, set out national norms, standards and targets against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded, inter alia, that:</p>  <p>  - Fire Services are applying and refining internationally-recognised risk management approaches to reduce the fire risk and the annual toll of life and property loss caused by fire.</p>  <p>  - Local authorities are matching the assessed fire risk in their individual fire station areas with services based on both full-time and retained fire service models, with a comprehensive support infrastructure, and applying a range of appropriate fire prevention and fire protection approaches.</p>  <p>  - Local authorities have prioritised and maintained the financial and personnel resources in their fire services at times when they were implementing significant reductions in all other areas.</p>  <p>  - Local authorities have benchmarked their fire services against national standards and national norms, and a strong degree of consistency, linked to area risk categorisation, now exists in fire service provision; all local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as minimum standards.</p>  <p>  A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/local-government/fire-and-emergency-management/fire-services-ireland-local-delivery-national.</p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that the National Directorate structure has been very effective in leading the development of emergency management in Ireland as well as fire services. The National Directorate was central to the work which underpinned the successful response to severe weather emergencies including Ex-Hurricane Ophelia in October 2017 and Storm Emma earlier this year. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the &ldquo;Fire Safety Task Force&rdquo; Report in May 2018, which was convened at my request by the National Directorate, I have asked the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of Task Force Report. </p>  <p>  I have no additional plans for the reorganisation of the fire service at national, regional and local level at this time, as the evidence suggests that current arrangements, as outlined, are working effectively to meet the challenges involved in trying to protect communities from fire and other emergencies. </p></reply>

Implementation of this Directive is transposed through the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  I understand that the concepts of &lsquo;working time&rsquo; and &lsquo;rest periods&rsquo; as provided for in the Directive were the subject of a recent judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union. </p>  <p>  The judgment of the Court was noted at my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Board meeting of 13 September 2018. The Management Board requested that preliminary legal advice be sought regarding the potential impact of the judgment and I understand that this should be available by the end of the year.

This includes regular attendance at a wide variety of inter-Departmental meetings that take place on a weekly and fortnightly basis, as well as internal discussions through a range of fora, including a specific cross-Divisional co-ordination group and at the Department's Management Board.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to predict with confidence the impact of Brexit on housing as this will be determined in large part by the outcome of the process around the draft withdrawal agreement but also by the nature of the future relationship between the UK and the EU.  Nonetheless, the Brexit planning arrangements in place, taking account also of established approach to longer term planning, including in relation to the National Planning Framework, provide an effective vehicle for ensuring that the potential impact of developments within the evolving Brexit process can be assessed.</p></reply>

Irish Water has entered into service level agreements (SLAs) with each local authority for the provision of water services.  Staff members working under these arrangements remain local authority employees while continuing to perform key water services functions with local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water.  Staffing arrangements are an operational matter for Irish Water and local authorities within the context of the SLA arrangements currently in place.</p>  <p>  On 19 September 2018, I received a report from the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in respect of a process of engagement that was undertaken at my request with the parties involved in the transformation programme for Irish Water, those being Irish Water, ICTU and relevant affiliated unions, Local Government management and my Department.  The context here lies in Irish Water&rsquo;s proposal to fully integrate its operations and end the current operational arrangements for the delivery of water services through the service level agreements with local authorities.  The discussions with the parties have advanced on the basis that the current SLAs remain in place until such time as an alternative is agreed.</p>  <p>  In considering the WRC report in consultation with my Government colleagues, I have been particularly mindful of the WRC&rsquo;s comments that uncertainty about the next phase of transformation appears to be causing staffing difficulties at Local Government level and that further delay in providing the necessary clarity could exacerbate this situation and increase risks to the safe and effective delivery of water and wastewater services.  Therefore, in the interests of clarity, I am asking the parties to now engage in a process to work towards the development of a stable structural and operational framework for the future. I am grateful for the commitment of the WRC to facilitate this process.  My Department has been in communication with the parties in this regard.</p></reply>

An annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out, on a short-term basis &ndash; i.e. for 14 days or less at a time, of a person&rsquo;s entire home where it is their primary residence.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it as a Short Term Letting (STL), they will require planning permission to do so unless the property is already permitted to be used for tourism / short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to STL can be sought and it will be up to each local Planning Authority to consider applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners to prepare for and adapt to the new laws. In addition to revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which have been prepared, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals; drafting of these amendments is currently underway.</p>  <p>  Any unauthorised development, including breaches of the proposed exemptions, may be the subject of planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority.</p></reply>

The provisions involved include power for the imposition of sanctions on landlords in breach of the legal requirements and power for the RTB to investigate without the need for a complaint to be made.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the RTB to appropriately resource and develop its capacity to implement these provisions. The proposed new powers for the RTB are a crucial first step in expanding its overall role and function as part of a multi-annual change management programme to proactively enforce tenancy law. The RTB publishes its quarterly Rent Index and advises my Department on the residential rental market on a continuous basis which informs policy development in this area.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill and I hope to bring the Bill to Government in the coming weeks for approval to publish.</p></reply>

In any such capacity, my Department may make submissions or observations to assist the responsible authority in carrying out its functions, including consent functions, in compliance with various legislative and administrative requirements with respect to the conservation, protection and preservation of natural and built heritage.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposal referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, in September 2016 the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Northern Ireland (DAERA-NI) consulted under its Marine Works (Environment Impact Assessment) Regulations 2007 with various bodies in the Republic of Ireland, including my Department, to inform its decision making as to whether an Environmental Impact Assessment was required for the proposal by Warrenpoint Harbour Authority to create a new disposal site within Carlingford Lough and within the jurisdiction boundaries of the Harbour Authority, to dispose of material dredged from within the Harbour limits. </p>  <p>  Whilst my Department endeavours to provide observations or submissions on developments that have been referred for comment it is not always in a position to do so.  No inference however should be drawn from this that my Department is satisfied or otherwise with a development, plan or programme, or that natural or built heritage matters are not material considerations, if my Department does not issue observations on a particular proposal. While my Department may or may not provide observations, , I am not the competent authority for proposals such as that was submitted for Carlingford Lough by Warrenpoint Harbour Authority. It is a matter for the competent authority in this regard to assess the environmental impact assessment screening report and ensure the findings are in compliance with the relevant environment impact assessment legislation.</p>  <p>  I understand that in the case of the Warrenpoint Harbour proposal DAERA-NI were content that the proposal did not require a full environmental impact assessment and that the Harbour Authority was obliged to undergo a full site characterisation assessment exercise. I further understand that the placement of dredged material is licensable and that there will be further surveys, assessment and consultation processes. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would be best placed to advise further on this process.</p></reply>

A further process of examination of the marine Special Areas of Conservation was carried out in 2009 and 2016. Ireland is now considered sufficient in almost all respects although there is a "scientific reserve"  on sufficiency of marine sites for reef habitat and for the bottle-nosed dolphin.</p>  <p>  In 2007, the European Court of Justice in case C-418/04 ruled that Ireland was required to designate additional Special Protection Areas, under the EU Birds Directive. This process is largely complete for land and freshwater sites, although there are still some landowner appeals under consideration in a small number of sites.</p>  <p>  Ireland is still required by the European Commission to complete an analysis of the requirements (if any) to designate Special Protection Areas in Ireland&rsquo;s marine territory. Data collection on seabird distribution has been carried out in the past 3 years and this data will be reviewed in 2019 to determine if there are marine areas which meet the criteria for such designation.  </p></reply>
