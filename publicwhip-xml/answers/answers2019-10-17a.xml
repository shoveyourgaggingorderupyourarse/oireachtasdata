This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of nearly &euro;2 billion since 2016.  </p><p>In relation to staffing in our schools we have, since May 2016:</p><p>- provided for an additional 3,000 SNAs and over 7,300 new teaching posts, with a further 1,000 SNA positions and 581 teaching posts for the 2020/21 school year as a result of Budget 2020.</p><p>- cut the pupil teacher ratio at primary level twice</p><p>- introduced a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020</p><p>- provided 1,300 new middle management positions at primary level (also 1,300 at post-primary level)</p><p>- increased significantly the number of release days allowed to &ldquo;Teaching Principals&rdquo; with one more additional release day in September 2020 as a result of Budget 2020.  </p><p>In the current school year, the number of teachers employed in our schools have reached the highest ever level. Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015/16 school year with the current school year.  This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to a general average of 26 pupils to every 1 teacher, the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.</p><p>The Budget 2020 measure of improved teacher staffing levels for schools with four teachers or less will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher. </p><p>Over 1,300 schools across the country with 4 teachers or less will feel the benefit of this improvement in the staffing schedule. </p><p>The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period.  It is expected that these ratios will further improve when the statistics for the 2019/20 school year are published at the end of the school year.</p></reply>

The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The work now underway in relation to small schools seeks to build on this in a sustainable way. Between now and next March, I will continue to engage with the main partners through the Primary Education Forum and my Department&rsquo;s Small Schools Steering Group to develop a new policy of supports for small schools and feed into the Estimates process for 2021.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 is the third successive budget to provide for an increase in the number of principal release days.  One additional release day will be allocated to each school with a teaching principal with effect from 1 September 2020.  This will bring the number of release days to 19, 25 and 31, depending on the size of school.  This is an increase from 14, 18 and 22 days since 2015.  In addition, a further four additional release days are allocated to schools with special classes.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increase of release days, the Government lifted the moratorium on middle management posts in 2017.  In total almost 1300 leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since 2017 which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  My Department has committed to revising the number of available Posts of Responsibility to take account of retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibilities are maintained in the school system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-17a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101700039#WRA02000"><p>The Department&rsquo;s capital budget for 2020 should be considered in the context of an increase of over 26% between 2018 and 2019 (&euro;745m in 2018 rising to &euro;941m in 2019). Also, the value achieved from the disposal by TU Dublin of its Kevin Street property, the sale of which closed in August, means that the Department no longer needs to set aside a significant funding envelope for the Grangegorman development in 2020.  The Kevin Street property sold for &euro;140m which was about &euro;60m above the guide price. This reduces pressure on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget in 2020.</p>  <p>  The allocation for my Department's School Buildings programme in 2020 is broadly in line with the allocation for 2019.  In 2019 the allocation was &euro;622m. The allocation envisaged for 2020 is &euro;620m. This &euro;2m reduction will have no material impact on the school building programme.</p>  <p>  Given these circumstances the impact of the changes to the capital budget is unlikely to impact to any significant extent on projects.</p></reply>

The Patron advised that an invitation to consultation meetings was forwarded to the Boards of Management of both schools in question and to all representative groups identified in both communities.  In total, eleven groups were identified and meetings arranged between February and July 2019.  The Patron advised that the majority of the meetings proceeded and the majority views taken into consideration.  A small number of meetings were cancelled by the group/association concerned and did not proceed. </p>  <p>  The two schools due to amalgamate will continue to operate from the existing school sites until a new school building is provided. It is envisaged that the construction phase for the new amalgamated school will be facilitated with investment available during the second half of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 to 2027.  </p>  <p>  The new, amalgamated school will be built to the highest standards and will be compliant with Part L of the Building Regulations 2017.  It will also provide the opportunity for the school to have a fully equipped PE Hall facility with fitness suite together with provision of accommodation to meet special education needs in West Cavan at Port-Primary level.</p></reply>

It is improves their communicative competence in Gaeilge, in the context of their future role as teachers of Irish and other subjects through Irish. It also enhances their understanding of life and culture in the Gaeltacht and the reality of life in bilingual communities.  That is why the Teaching Council has made the placement compulsory for all student teachers at primary to graduate. </p><p>Approximately 2,400 student teachers will benefit from this measure in the first year.</p></reply>

It focuses on the whole school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified needs.  Schools promote wellbeing through a range of activities and approaches to support the academic, physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual development of all children and young people. </p>  <p>  Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also provides a referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in my Department provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with identified difficulties.  Consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions delivered in the school setting is also available.  </p>  <p>  When counselling or more specialised intervention is considered to be required, a referral is made to an outside agency.  NEPS supports schools with this onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.</p></reply>

This reduces pressure on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget in 2020.</p>  <p> - The allocation for the School Buildings programme is broadly in line with last year&rsquo;s allocation.  In 2019, the allocation was &euro;622m and the allocation envisaged for the School Building Programme in 2020 is &euro;620m.  This is a difference of &euro;2m (0.3% of a reduction). A &euro;2m reduction will have no material impact on the delivery of the school building programme.</p>  <p>  Capital planning and budgeting is undertaken on a multi-annual basis.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;12 billion over the period 2018-2027.  This includes some &euro;8.8 billion for the schools sector and &euro;2.2 billion for higher education infrastructure.

These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

As such, I fully recognise their value to communities right across the country. They provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activity.</p>  <p>  The majority of rural schools (over 1,200) are classed as small - having 4 or fewer teachers. Whilst facing the challenges and opportunities that all schools do, this particular group of schools has specific challenges. I have been listening to our partners around this and discussing what we can do to support small schools and ensure that they have a sustainable future. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents and I am honouring this partnership approach as I examine the issue. </p>  <p>  I have spoken with international colleagues to hear their perspective and, together with my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural and Community Development, hosted a Symposium on Small Schools. I want to actively engage with the people and organisations who work in and with small schools and who understand the value and opportunities they offer to their communities. </p>  <p>  Already, we as a Government have shown that we are listening and I was pleased to announced additional supports in Budget 2020. This record level of investment in the sector is providing for an extra release day for teaching principals and improved teaching staffing levels for small schools. The work now underway in relation to small schools seeks to build on this in a sustainable way. Between now and next March, I will continue to engage with the main partners through the Primary Education Forum and my Department&rsquo;s Small Schools Steering Group to develop a new policy of supports for small schools and feed into the Estimates process for 2021. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 academic year the DEIS Programme is available in 891 schools serving over 190,000 students. My Department will invest approximately &euro;125 million this year on the programme and this includes the provision of  enhanced school book grants to all DEIS Schools,  enhanced staffing in DEIS Band 1 Primary Schools, enhanced allocation for dedicated career guidance counsellor in DEIS Post-Primary schools and enhanced National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) allocation time and the payment of a DEIS Grant to all DEIS schools. In addition all DEIS Urban Primary and DEIS Post Primary schools are included in the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) Scheme.  The scheme is delivered by 415 full-time HSCL Coordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.<b></b>Responding to specific actions in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy  (NTRIS) and DEIS Plan 2017,  my Department has committed to the assignment of 4 HSCLs, as part of a 2 Year Pilot Programme commencing in the 2019/20 school year in 4 areas to target attendance, participation and retention/school completion for Traveller and Roma pupils.</p><p>You may be aware that at the request of my Department, the Educational Research Centre (ERC) has conducted an independent evaluation of the School Support Programme (SSP) component of DEIS in urban and rural primary schools and in post-primary schools. Like the DEIS programme itself, the evaluation is multifaceted, and is attempting to monitor the implementation of the programme and assess its impact on students, families and schools. The evaluation reports are published on the ERC&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>The latest report on the evaluation of the DEIS programme by the ERC, The Evaluation of DEIS at Post-Primary Level: Closing the Achievement and Attainment Gaps, was published in January 2019. It shows that the achievement and attainment gaps between DEIS and non-DEIS post-primary schools continue to narrow, both in terms of performance at Junior Certificate level and retention rates. It is also encouraging to see a rise in the percentage of students in DEIS schools taking English and Mathematics at Higher Level.</p><p>The findings from the latest evaluation report supports the rationale to continue to target resources at schools with concentrations of students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds.  It is important to continue to implement the 108 Actions of DEIS Plan 2017 to address the needs of our most marginalised students. One example of an action we are taking to narrow the gap between DEIS and Non-DEIS is the School Excellence Fund (SEF)-DEIS. SEF-DEIS enables schools to apply for funding to implement innovative programmes which are context specific and are aimed at improving educational outcomes. At the end of May I announced Tranche 3 of SEF-DEIS  and the closing date for receipt of applications has recently been extended to 31 October. Further details on how to apply are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p></reply>

Earlier in the year, I hosted a symposium on Small Schools which gave me an opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to small schools and to open a dialogue with all the key stakeholders. The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 is the third successive budget to provide for an increase in the number of principal release days.  One additional release day will be allocated to each school with a teaching principal with effect from 1 September 2020.  This will bring the number of release days to 19, 25 and 31, depending on the size of school.  This is an increase from 14, 18 and 22 days since 2015.  In addition, a further four additional release days are allocated to schools with special classes.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increase of release days, the Government lifted the moratorium on middle management posts in 2017.  In total almost 1300 leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since 2017 which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  My Department has committed to revising the number of available Posts of Responsibility to take account of retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibilities are maintained in the school system. </p></reply>

These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

The allocation envisaged for 2020 is &euro;620m. This &euro;2m reduction will have no material impact on the school building programme.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s capital budget for 2020 should be considered in the context of an increase of over 26% between 2018 and 2019 (&euro;745m in 2018 rising to &euro;941m in 2019). Also, the value achieved from the disposal by TU Dublin of its Kevin Street property, the sale of which closed in August, means that the Department no longer needs to set aside a significant funding envelope for the Grangegorman development in 2020.  The Kevin Street property sold for &euro;140m which was about &euro;60m above the guide price. This reduces pressure on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget in 2020.</p>  <p>  The allocation for schools will support circa 60 new school building projects going to construction in 2020 delivering in excess of 30,000 school places (permanent additional and replacement places). </p>  <p>  During 2018 and 2019, the capital budget is facilitating extensions and new schools being delivered as part of the rollout of Project Ireland 2040 which involved overall construction activity during 2018 and 2019 of circa 130 large scale projects ranging in value from &euro;1m to projects in excess of &euro;20m.  There was also in excess of 280 projects with a project value less than &euro;1m at construction during this period.  All of these projects are expected to deliver more than 40,000 permanent (additional and replacement) school places and replace circa 600 prefabs.  This will make significant progress in relation to providing modern energy efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation.  </p>  <p>  My Department's priority is to ensure that every child will have access to a physical school place.  In this regard, it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools.  My Department takes an integrated approach with the replacement of temporary accommodation as part of large-scale projects or as part of new projects approved under my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation Scheme.</p></reply>

Supports available include Special Education Teaching support in schools; funding for Assistive Technology such as soundfield and FM systems; and guidance from the NCSE&rsquo;s Visiting Teacher service on classroom adaptation and school staff training.</p><p>All children are in receipt of special educational needs teaching support under the new model introduced in 2017 and revised in 2019. The new Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on that school&rsquo;s educational profile, to allow schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools. Schools deploy additional teaching resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. </p><p>No school received an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, which is less than the allocation they had received to support pupils with Low Incidence special educational needs during the 2016/17 school year. </p><p>No allocation for pupils made by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school and whereas schools have greater discretion as to how they can distribute resources under the new model, based on the individual needs of pupils, no reduction in allocations have been made to schools in respect of any pupils who were previously in receipt of a Low Incidence special needs allocation in that school.</p><p>The Visiting Teaching Service has assessed the educational needs of all 9 children and made recommendations to their schools.In accordance with the Visiting Teachers&rsquo; Service Referral Process and Procedures, children with mild or unilateral hearing loss are placed on the &ldquo;On Request&rdquo; caseload and children with moderate-profound hearing loss are placed on the &ldquo;Active&rdquo; caseload of the Visiting Teacher. </p><p>The Visiting Teachers have assessed the acoustic conditions in the schools and made recommendations to schools to put in place appropriate measures to cater for the children&rsquo;s needs. Schools may utilise existing funding streams from the Department such as the Minor Works Grant or Grants for furniture and equipment for special education needs, to provide equipment, if these are recommended. </p><p>All nine children have received assistive technology, in accordance with the criteria of the scheme.</p><p>With regard to teacher training, the NCSE can provide direct support to the schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible. Schools can apply for support through the NCSE&rsquo;s online application system, available at the following web address: . </p><p>The NCSE offers telephone advice, school visits from a member of the team, in-service courses for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the children&rsquo;s educational needs, as they progresses through school.</p><p>Schools have been instructed to continue to engage with their local SENO and Visiting Teacher with regard to the special education needs of the children identified by the HSE review. Parents/guardians may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on . </p><p>My Department has made direct contact with both the schools and parents/guardians and a representative of my Department also met with a group of affected parents/guardians in November 2018 and March 2019. The HSE, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and NCSE were also represented at those meetings.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with the HSE and will review supports as a matter of priority should details of other affected children be supplied by the HSE.</p></reply>

At &euro;1.88bn, 2020 will see the highest level to date of spend on higher education in a single year. </p>  <p>  This funding will provide: </p>  <p> - For the launch of the Human Capital Initiative with &euro;60 million in 2020, providing an additional 3,000 student places.</p>  <p> - &euro;19 million to address demographic pressures, accommodating a further 2,700 places. </p>  <p> - A multi-annual fund of &euro;90 million to assist the development and progression of Technological Universities (TUs).</p>  <p> - Funding of &euro;3.3 million to promote excellence in research. </p>  <p> - Funding of &euro;2 million for student mental health and wellbeing initiatives in the higher education sector. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 will deliver an additional 2,700 new undergraduate student places through investment of &euro;19m in 2020. This is reflective of the growing demographic pressures in higher education. This is part of a &euro;60m increase in current funding to provide for increased student numbers over the three year period 2018-2020.</p>  <p>  Increased demographic provision will be supplemented by the expansion of places in Higher Education in priority skill areas under the Human Capital Initiative (HCI). Through this fund an additional 1,500 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate conversion places will be provided in 2020.  This equates to a total of 5,700 additional student places in higher education in 2020.</p>  <p>  The HCI will be a transformative development for the third level sector. The HCI will invest &euro;300 million in Higher Education over the period 2020 to 2024. Funded from the surplus in the National Training Fund, the HCI will help to realise the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, Future Jobs Ireland and the National Skills Strategy. At &euro;60 million per year over the next 5 years, it will form a key part of our strategic response to addressing the skills needs of the economy,  mitigating Brexit risks, responding to digitalisation and the future world of work, and preparing ourselves for other challenges that the economy may face.</p>  <p>  In order to actively address increasing demand on wellbeing, I have announced ring-fenced funding of &euro;2m which will assist institutions in supporting students with their mental health and wellbeing. This is in addition to existing spending, in the region of &euro;7m, by institutions in the area of &lsquo;Welfare and Guidance&rsquo; which includes counselling services, health promotion, careers service, multi-faith, racial and ethnic cultural support.</p>  <p>  The objective Research Excellence fund is to strengthen the international competitiveness and visibility of Ireland&rsquo;s research capability.   Excellence in research emerges on the basis of international competition and collaboration, and these are increasingly important, especially in addressing today's global challenges. Ireland's research system is well regarded internationally in relation to factors such as academic freedom, a culture of open intellectual engagement and support for innovation. </p>  <p>  As part of a programme of planned reforms of the National Training Fund the levy has increased from 0.7% to 1.0% between 2018 and 2020. The increase in the Training Levy has yielded an additional &euro;190 million for investment in the tertiary education sector over this period. This investment has facilitated the huge growth we have seen in apprenticeship numbers, a 40% increase in participants in Skillnet Ireland programmes, and has led to the creation of the important ETB Skills to Advance programme.</p>  <p>  Through Budget 2020 my Department has committed &euro;27m in additional funding to  further the expansion of the apprenticeship programme with over 7,500 new registrations on craft and new apprenticeships. An additional &euro;8 million will support 7,000 additional participants on Skillnet Ireland programmes including a new digital skills initiative and an SME upskilling scheme. The ETB Skills to Advance programme will be supported with an additional &euro;6 million to allow for the upskilling of an additional 3,000 people in the workforce.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am confident that this substantial level of addtional investment in third level education will bring significant benefits both for individuals and in terms of enhancing the skills available across the Irish economy to equip us for an ever-changing environment locally, nationally and on the global stage.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level and Budget 2019 which provided over 1300 additional posts in schools.</p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level and 13.8:1 to 13:1 at post primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  It is expected that these ratios will further improve when the statistics for the 2019/20 school year are published.</p></reply>

These measures will take effect from September 2020.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department is in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC.</p></reply>

As such, I fully recognise their value to communities right across the country. They provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activity.</p>  <p>  The majority of rural schools (over 1,200) are classed as small - having 4 or fewer teachers. Whilst facing the challenges and opportunities that all schools do, this particular group of schools has specific challenges. I have been listening to our partners around this and discussing what we can do to support small schools and ensure that they have a sustainable future. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents and I am honouring this partnership approach as I examine the issue. </p>  <p>  I have spoken with international colleagues to hear their perspective and, together with my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural and Community Development, hosted a Symposium on Small Schools. I want to actively engage with the people and organisations who work in and with small schools and who understand the value and opportunities they offer to their communities. </p>  <p>  Already, we as a Government have shown that we are listening and I was pleased to announced additional supports in Budget 2020. The work now underway in relation to small schools seeks to build on this in a sustainable way. Between now and next March, I will continue to engage with the main partners through the Primary Education Forum and my Department&rsquo;s Small Schools Steering Group to develop a new policy of supports for small schools and feed into the Estimates process for 2021. </p></reply>

I have been listening to our partners around this and discussing what we can do to support small schools and ensure that they have a sustainable future. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents and I am honouring this partnership approach as I examine the issue. </p>  <p>  I have spoken with international colleagues to hear their perspective and, together with my colleague Michael Ring, Minister for Rural and Community Development, hosted a Symposium on Small Schools. I want to actively engage with the people and organisations who work in and with small schools and who understand the value and opportunities they offer to their communities. </p>  <p>  Already, we as a Government have shown that we are listening and I was pleased to announced additional supports in Budget 2020. This record level of investment in the sector is providing for an extra release day for teaching principals and improved teaching staffing levels for small schools. The work now underway in relation to small schools seeks to build on this in a sustainable way. Between now and next March, I will continue to engage with the main partners through the Primary Education Forum and my Department&rsquo;s Small Schools Steering Group to develop a new policy of supports for small schools and feed into the Estimates process for 2021. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 reduced PTR for small schools.</p></reply>

The engineering advice following those detailed investigations was that some temporary engineering solutions and other precautionary measures should be completed in some parts of some of these buildings until permanent remediation works were designed, programmed and delivered.  These works were completed in advance of these schools re-opening for the new school year.</p>  <p>  The programme to complete the remediation of all the impacted schools is continuing, with the intention to maximise the summer holiday periods in 2020 and 2021 to carry out permanent works. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that I recently announced that the independent review of current use and practices in the Design and Build Procurement/Construction Model for the delivery of school building internationally has been awarded to the School of Surveying and Construction Management, Technological University Dublin.  The scope and nature of the current review is designed to ensure that it does not prejudice the on-going legal process initiated by the Department against the company and others.</p>  <p>  The report arising from this review will be finalised by the end of Quarter 4 this year.  </p>  <p>  The independent review will be an important precursor in a planned wider independent review of the Department&rsquo;s Design &amp;amp; Build Programme which will commence when the ongoing legal process has concluded.  </p>  <p>  Design and Build has been one of a mix of procurement routes used by the Department of Education and Skills to deliver school places over the past 10 years.  </p>  <p>  Other procurement methods employed by the Department include traditional procurement, i.e. the design work is contracted separately from the construction; Public Private Partnerships (PPPs); and devolved delivery, i.e. where a project is devolved to another entity, such as an Education and Training Board (ETB), the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), local authority or OPW, for delivery. It is considered that the use of a mix of procurement routes has been, and continues to be, essential to delivering school places at the pace required, taking account of capacity both in the construction industry and the public sector.</p></reply>

In addition, in the ongoing reviews of the Primary Curriculum and of the Senior Cycle the skills of, or skills closely related to, digital literacy, have featured strongly in all discussions on future provision.  </p>  <p>  Currently at post-primary level, there are several programmes and courses in ICT and Digital Literacy already in place, particularly the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Literacy and the IT courses in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. To a lesser extent, the recently-introduced Leaving Certificate subject in Computer Science also looks at aspects of digital literacy. </p>  <p>  In studying the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Media Literacy, students learn to use digital technology, communication tools and the internet creatively, critically and safely, in support of their development, learning and capacity to participate effectively in social and community life.</p>  <p>  The Information and Communication Technology module forms part of the core curriculum for all Leaving Certificate Applied students. It is intended to develop the students&rsquo; skills, knowledge, attitudes and understanding of Information and Communication Technology to enable them to use digital technology in both their current and future lives. </p>  <p>  In addition, areas such as Wellbeing and its constituent programmes in Social, Personal and Health Education, Relationships and Sexuality Education and Civic, Social and Political Education also underpin skills of digital literacy in engaging with the subject material in these courses.</p>  <p>  The Digital Learning Framework is currently being disseminated to all schools. The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process and will help towards the development of digital literacy skills. The development and adaption of this Framework is a key objective of the Digital Strategy for Schools which is currently being implemented. </p></reply>

The purpose of the demonstration project is to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports that allows for early intervention in terms of providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complements existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services. </p>  <p> - Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 200% from 548 to 1,621 for 2019/2020 school year. Of these 1,355 special classes will cater for students diagnosed with ASD. </p>  <p> - 167 new special classes have been established nationally for 2019/20 school year of which approximately 156 will be new ASD special classes, comprising 6 Early Intervention, 100 primary and 50 post-primary ASD classes. udget 2020 provides for an additional 265 special class teachers in 2020, which will allow for the opening of additional classes to cater for over 1,300 additional places, where required.</p>  <p> - 124 special schools providing specialist education for approximately 7,500 pupils annually with over 1,400 teachers. Budget 2020 provides for an additional 23 teaching posts for special schools, designed to meet expected increases in enrolments in 2020, providing over 8,000 pupil places in special schools. It also provides for the continued provision of administrative deputy principal posts in special schools with 15+ teaching posts, introduced in special schools for the first time this September.</p>  <p> - The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. This Policy Advice is to be completed and a report submitted to the Minister no later than June 2020. It is anticipated that a progress report will be submitted by the NCSE in the coming weeks.</p>  <p> - Other supports provides for assistive technology supports and equipment, special school transport arrangements including additional transport assistance such as bus escorts; teacher training and continuing professional development in the area of special education; enhanced capitation levels for special schools and special classes and modification of school buildings to assist with access and new build provisions to ensure inclusive settings in newly built schools.</p>  <p> - The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) includes a new Regional Support Service within the NCSE to support the inclusion of children with special educational needs in schools.</p>  <p> - A Home Tuition scheme provides for the education of children with special educational needs who are awaiting school placement and the July provision provides for an extended school year scheme.</p>  <p> - Special Arrangements for State Examinations &ndash; reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs to participate in state exams.</p>  <p>  This increased investment in teachers, SNAs, therapeutic and other supports reflects the priority which this Government has put on helping children with special educational needs to fulfil their potential. It also reflects the growing participation of children with Special Educational Needs in the Education System and the capacity of the Education System to better support their full participation and progression.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of unprecedented level of investment, I am aware that issues remain. </p>  <p>  There are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system. </p>  <p>  In these areas, some parents are experiencing difficulty in securing a suitable place for their children. This will continue to be a major concern for me and my Department.</p>  <p>  Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 has been invoked already and it may need to be used again.  However, my stated preference is for schools to engage with this challenge on a voluntary basis because it is the right thing for the children in their community.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support the NCSE to continue to work with schools, patron bodies and teachers so that they can establish special classes where required with confidence.  In that way, parents can be happy that the education needs of their children will be provided for in their local school in so far as possible.</p>  <p>  Ensuring every child has access to a suitable school placement is a priority for me and my Department and we will continue to ensure that this can be provided for.</p></reply>

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement. As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant. Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p>  <p>  Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs. The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2019/2020 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0030/2019 which issued on 22 May 2019.</p>  <p>  The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0030/2019 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed. Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment. Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).</p>  <p>  My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.  </p>  <p>  I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010, and we saw the resumption of capital punishment in Bahrain in 2017 as a very negative development. Ireland condemns the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Along with our EU partners, Ireland calls on Bahrain to again introduce a moratorium on executions, as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty. </p>  <p>  I am also aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. I understand that a large number of prisoners held in Jau Prison in Bahrain went on hunger strike in response to these conditions. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. We shall consider carefully any opportunity to participate in a joint statement at a future Human Rights Council session, and I have asked my officials to keep the matter under review.</p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister in New York last month I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, including at the Human Rights Council, whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

There is a maximum rebate of 7.5 cents per litre when the retail price is &euro;1.25 (Vat exclusive) or above.   </p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing the road haulage sector due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, I announced in my Budget 2020 speech that the DRS is being enhanced. The detail of this is set out in the Finance Bill which is being published today. In brief, the price floor of &euro;1.00 (Vat exclusive) will remain the same; the marginal rebate rate will double at a price point of &euro;1.07 or above; the maximum rebate amount will remain at 7.5 cents per litre; and the amended DRS will apply to fuel purchased by qualifying operators from 1st January 2020. </p>  <p>  This represents a significant enhancement of the terms of the DRS. By way of example, the current average price of a litre of diesel is &euro;1.093 (Vat exclusive), which if used as the average price under the current DRS would entitle qualifying operators to a rebate of 2.8c per litre. Under the enhanced DRS, qualifying operators would be entitled to a rebate of 4.4c if an average per litre price of &euro;1.109 (Vat exclusive) were to be used as the basis for calculating the rebate. In other words, in the example outlined above, an additional 1.6c to the average price of a litre of diesel would be matched by the additional rebate amount. More generally, at a price point of &euro;1.16 (Vat exclusive), the rebate amount under the enhanced DRS is 7.5c per litre which is 2.7c per litre more than the rebate amount that would be paid under the current DRS.       </p>  <p>  I appreciate that this scheme is a fossil fuel subsidy which the ESRI has found is directly increasing CO2 emissions. However, I consider, on balance, that the specific Brexit challenges faced by hauliers justifies this enhancement. This is intended as a temporary support measure, to be reviewed as part of the annual budgetary process. </p></reply>

One criteria for drawdown is that it can be used to remedy or mitigate the existence of &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; in the State. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, such circumstances are defined as either a period of severe economic downturn or a period during which an unusual event outside the control of the State has a major impact on the financial position of the general government.</p>  <p>  The RDF is intended, therefore, to be used as a defined-purpose instrument to address severe events, as opposed to the normal fluctuations within the economic cycle. This approach aligns it with the current EU fiscal rules framework, whereby there could be a drawdown from the RDF for an &ldquo;unusual event&rdquo; under the existing Stability and Growth Pact provisions. Withdrawals from the RDF will be transferred directly to the Exchequer so as to support shortfalls in revenue and voted expenditure to address the specific downturn.  The RDF Act deliberately does not describe specific events, such as Brexit or others, so as to give flexibility to Governments to withdraw from the Fund for all severe downturns, many of which are not possible to specify in advance. </p>  <p>  A drawdown from the RDF should not be the first action taken in the face of a no-deal Brexit, as the Government has already taken significant steps to prepare for Brexit and will continue to do so. These steps to prepare include dedicated measures, and economic and fiscal policies to get Ireland Brexit ready in Budgets since 2016.  </p>  <p>  I would, therefore, envisage that the occurrence of a Brexit with a significant fiscal impact and/or an economic downturn would justify draw down from the RDF.  This is the sensible approach to using the Rainy Day Fund so as to ensure its funds are available and used to support measures that are timely, targeted and temporary, to assist in converting our economy and its businesses to a post-Brexit world.  I would note that the Exchequer holds significant cash balances that are available for use immediately in responding to the fallout from all Brexit scenarios.</p></reply>

The other key findings of the report noted that insurers often sell policies at a discount to new customers and increase premiums when customers renew, targeting increases at those less likely to switch; and that this appeared to impact consumers that showed at least one characteristic of vulnerability, such as having lower financial capability.  While this is an interim report and it does not recommend any remedies at this stage, the FCA is due to publish its final report with possible remedies in Q1 2020.</p>  <p>  Both Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I have concerns about the potential impact that dual pricing practices could have on certain vulnerable customers if they are being employed in Ireland, particularly in light of the interim findings in the UK on the matter.  Prior to making any conclusions on this however, we need more detailed information about the extent and scale of the practice and what can be done to address it.  Accordingly, I have asked the Central Bank for their views on this matter as a first step.</p></reply>

All other MOT rates remain at their current levels until 1 May 2020 when new rates will take effect subject to the enactment of the Finance Bill 2019.</p><p>The current rate of MOT for marked gas oil (MGO), also referred to as &ldquo;green agricultural diesel&rdquo;, is &euro;102.28 per 1,000 litres, comprised of a carbon charge component of &euro;54.92 and a non-carbon charge component of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres.  These rates did not increase from Budget night. From 1 May 2020 the MOT rate for MGO will be &euro;117.78 per 1,000 litres, arising from the increase of the carbon component from &euro;54.92 to &euro;70.42; the non-carbon component will not change from its current level of &euro;47.36 per 1,000 litres.  </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that agricultural contractors who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for those expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p><p>When carbon tax was increased in Budget 2012, provision was made for a separate and additional tax measure for farmers to compensate them for the increase.  The statutory basis for this tax relief is section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  It is available to individuals and companies that carry on a trade of farming and are entitled to claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction in respect of farm diesel.  However, it should be noted that agricultural contractors are not entitled to this relief as they are not carrying on a trade of farming. This is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires the occupation of farm land and agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farm land.  </p><p>The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) was introduced in 2013 and offers a partial refund to qualifying road operators on the excise paid on diesel when the retail price is &euro;1.00 (Vat exclusive) or above. The maximum rebate is 7.5 cents per litre when the retail price is &euro;1.25 (Vat exclusive) or above.</p><p>Certain qualifying criteria apply, for example, auto diesel must be purchased in the State, either in bulk (over 2,000 litres) or via a Revenue approved Fuel Card, and used in a qualifying vehicle for the purpose of business transport activities. Operators with a licence issued in other EU Member States are also eligible to claim on diesel purchased in the State subject to meeting all the other scheme criteria.</p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing the road haulage sector due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, I announced in my budget speech that the Diesel Rebate Scheme is being enhanced. The publication of the Finance Bill today will set out the details of the enhancements to the Scheme. This is intended as a temporary support measure, to be reviewed as part of the annual budgetary process.</p><p>Full details regarding the Diesel Rebate Scheme and qualification criteria are available on the website of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners:  </p><p>.</p></reply>

As the market developed over the years this treatment resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils. The scope of the relatively narrow original zero rating of food supplement products permitted by Revenue broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplements that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. This caused difficulties for both Revenue and industry. </p>  <p>  Following a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplements, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following this review, Revenue engaged with the Department of Finance concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. </p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, Revenue delayed the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This allowed time for the my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The public consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward was evidence based. The results of the consultation were included in the 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group paper as part of the Budget 2020 process. </p>  <p>  The implementation of a 13.5% rate will provide certainty to industry in respect of food supplement products and will apply prospectively. It is important to clarify that certain products will not be impacted by the change introduced in this Finance Bill (e.g. foods for specific groups, vitamins and minerals such as folic acid licensed as medicines by the HPRA, and fortified foods). These products will continue to benefit from the zero rating for VAT purposes.</p></reply>

Dividends are treated as income and are ultimately liable to income tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate which is the highest rate of income tax to which they are liable. Universal Social Charge (USC) is also chargeable on the payments and in certain instances PRSI. </p>  <p>  As I announced in my Budget 2020 speech, Revenue has identified a potential gap between the DWT remitted by companies and the income tax and USC ultimately payable by Irish taxpayers. </p>  <p>  The rate of DWT that is currently applied is the standard 20% rate of income tax, but most individuals are also subject to the USC (0.5%, 2%, 4.5% and 8% rates).  When DWT was first introduced in 1999 and standard rated, there was no USC and the WHT rate has never been updated to take account of the USC.  As a result, the current 20% DWT rate does not cover the income taxes that are ultimately be due on a self-assessment basis so, while DWT has been applied to a dividend payment, a further amount of tax may be due. </p>  <p>  To address this gap, I announced changes to the DWT regime. Firstly, an increase in the rate of DWT from 20% to 25% from 1 January 2020. Secondly, from 1 January 2021, Revenue will introduce a modernised DWT regime that will utilise real-time data, which will allow a personalised rate of DWT to be applied to each individual taxpayer based on their marginal rate.</p>  <p>  The revised 25% rate is considered a reasonable combination of the 20% rate of income tax and the most common rate of USC which is the 4.5% that applies to income between &euro;19,874 and &euro;70,044.  In addition, it is likely that many of the taxpayers in question are also subject to the higher 40% rate of income tax. </p>  <p>  The &euro;80 million budgeted yield from the increase in the DWT rate from 20% to 25% is estimated based on prudent assumptions from payments in 2018 and to date in 2019. The yield is expected to arise on payments from Irish resident companies to Irish resident individuals in 2020 through reducing the potential gap described above between DWT withheld and the final tax payable by individuals. </p>  <p>  From 2021 onwards, the modernized DWT regime arising out of the newly modernized PAYE system will eliminate this gap by ensuring all individual taxpayers pay the right tax at the right time.  It is important to note there is no proposed change to due dates for companies to return DWT as part of the modernised regime.</p></reply>

The full list, detailing each of the available FRE allowances for 2019, is published on the Revenue website. </p><p>I am aware that over the past 18 months, Revenue has been conducting a comprehensive review of the FRE regime.  Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category of FRE allowance is being examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements.  I understand that the review may result in increases and decreases in several FRE categories, the withdrawal of the right to avail of the FRE allowance in certain categories and the introduction of new categories where appropriate.  Revenue have advised that a flat rate expense allowance can only be retained to the extent that there is a legislative basis to support the right to tax deductibility in respect of the expense.</p><p>Revenue has advised me that its FRE review is nearing conclusion, with an implementation date of 1 January 2020 for all changes to the FRE regime to make sure that employees in any one sector are not impacted on earlier than employees of another sector.  Revenue will be publishing a comprehensive list of all FRE allowances for 2020 in advance of the implementation date.</p><p>I am also advised by Revenue that it is not possible to accurately quantify the anticipated increase in tax revenue arising out of any abolition or reduction of FRE allowances, as the cost of such allowances vary depending on the particular circumstances of the individual recipients, for example, the extent of their income subject to tax and whether income is subject to tax at the standard or marginal rate. Moreover, a breakdown of the cost and numbers by reference to each employment category in which the FRE regime currently operates is not readily available. Prior to 2018, Revenue&rsquo;s systems were not designed to identify FREs as a separate item from expenses generally.  However, the current (2018) Income Tax Form 11 and Form 12 tax returns now have specific questions on FREs, which will allow Revenue to segregate FREs from expenses claimed generally. However, final figures for 2018 are not expected to be available until mid-2020 to allow for processing of the data from income tax returns and cross referencing across Revenue operational systems. No account was taken of potential yield from changes to the FRE regime from 2020 when formulating revenue raising measures for Budget 2020.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue who are independent in the performance of their functions.  Any changes in practice to the flat rate expenses regime are therefore a matter for Revenue, but I understand that any withdrawal of the practice can only take place if Revenue are satisfied that there is no longer a legally valid basis to give the concession, after engagement with the relevant representative body acting on behalf of the various categories of workers.  </p><p>There has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation which says that all employees are entitled to claim a tax deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.  Any changes to the general rule in section 114 TCA could lead to a considerable erosion of the income tax base, with potentially significant additional costs to the Exchequer, and are therefore not being considered at this time.</p><p>However, it is important to be clear that Revenue&rsquo;s operation of the regime does not preclude any employee from making an individual claim for a tax allowance in respect of employment-related expenses, where those expenses meet the statutory requirement for such an allowance.  Therefore, while certain employees may no longer claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may still be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.</p><p>At the same time, I expect that Revenue will implement the outcome of their review in their customary proportionate and fair manner fully cognisant of the impact on the individuals concerned, as they have done before on many occasions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-17a.247.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019101700042#WRD06800"><p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in reducing the prevalence of poverty in our country.  CSO data shows that the proportion of those living in consistent poverty dropped from 9.0% in 2013 to 6.7% in 2017. CSO data on poverty is available at this link: </p><p>For most people, employment is the primary path out of poverty and we have created thousands of new jobs, with a record 2.3 million people now at work in our economy.  Our income tax system is considered progressive by international standards; our tax revenue funds a wide range of services, with an emphasis on providing support to the groups in our society who need it the most.</p><p>Budget 2020 was framed in unique circumstances. What might be seen as normal Budgetary elements such as modest income tax reductions and across-the-board welfare rate increases did not feature. What did feature, however, were sizeable targeted expenditure increases in a number of sectors. These will have a positive impact on society to be factored into a balanced assessment of the Budget, rather than focusing solely on the fact that income tax and welfare payments remain largely unchanged. </p><p><b>Employment Affairs and Social Protection</b></p><p>A carefully targeted social welfare package, benefiting the vulnerable elderly, families and carers was introduced in Budget 2020. The Living Alone Allowance, which is targeted at the most vulnerable pensioners, was raised by &euro;5 per week; the Fuel Allowance was also increased, so that the increase for those in the lowest income deciles who receive it will more than cover the cost of the new carbon tax. There were further increases for qualified child dependants in all weekly payments. There was an increase in the earnings disregard for those in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment, and an increase of &euro;10 in Working Family Payment thresholds for recipients with up to three children. In addition there was an increase in the hours that carers can work or study outside the home. Finally, I announced payment of a 100% Christmas Bonus in 2019.</p><p><b>Distributional Impacts</b></p><p>The Department of Finance prepared an analysis on the distributional impacts of the direct tax, indirect tax and welfare measures contained in Budget 2020 using the SWITCH micro-simulation model. This analysis found on average the first three deciles gained from the tax and welfare measures and the rest of the deciles were left broadly unchanged. Gains were largest for the first decile, followed by the second and third which indicates that the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2020 were broadly progressive. The SWITCH analysis cannot take into account other expenditure measures such as increased expenditure in health or education.</p><p>Annex B of the Tax Policy Changes document published by the Department of Finance on Budget day also sets out a distributional analysis of Budget 2020 Measures on a variety of household family types across a range of income levels. The document is available at this link: </p><p><b>Expenditure</b></p><p>As set out in Expenditure Report 2020, the focus of the core element of Budget 2020 is on providing for sustainable increases in public expenditure. This is in recognition of the key role of public services and infrastructure in supporting our citizens and promoting the resilience of our economy, particularly in light of the increasing risks in the global economic environment. Particular focus was placed on maintaining and improving supports for children and families, as well as for elderly people. </p><p>In order to protect the most vulnerable in society, Budget 2020 provides an allocation of over &euro;21 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The significant provision of supports provided through the Social Protection system represents an important strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling poverty and social inequality in Ireland. </p><p>Gross current expenditure for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will see an increase of over 6% in 2020, rising to almost &euro;1.6 billion. As well as increased funding for Early Years Care and Education, central to this allocation is funding for the continued roll-out of the National Childcare Scheme.</p><p>&euro;17.4 billion in current expenditure will be allocated to the Health sector in 2020, a year on year increase of over 6%. This investment reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create a more responsive, integrated and people-centred Health system. New measures such as a reduction of prescription charges for over 70&rsquo;s, the expansion of free GP care to all children under 8 and free dental care for children under 6 will all contribute to improving access to health and social services across the country. </p><p>The Housing programme in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will see an increase of 11% compared with 2019, bringing the total allocation to almost &euro;2.6 billion (including current and capital expenditure). This allocation will support the Social Housing needs of over 27,500 households in 2020. This includes the delivery of 11,167 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes as well as supporting 16,350 new households under the HAP and RAS schemes.</p><p>Further details of these measures and all Budget 2020 allocations can be found in Expenditure Report 2020, which can be found on budget.gov.ie.</p><p><b>Carbon Tax</b></p><p>Budget 2020 included an increase in carbon tax of &euro;6 per tonne, which is expected to raise &euro;90 million in 2020. The funding raised is to be directed to support increases to existing climate related schemes or new schemes that would not have been provided in the absence of this increase. Government has been clear that the importance of clear action in this regard must be balanced with measures to promote equity during the transition. The revenue raised in 2020 will support:</p><p>- &euro;34 million in funding to protect the vulnerable through an increase in the fuel allowance and energy efficiency upgrades;</p><p>- &euro;31 million for schemes to ensure a just transition to a low carbon economy, including measures with a particular focus on the midlands;</p><p>- &euro;25 million for programmes that can help all citizens to reduce their carbon footprint. </p><p>These measures are set out in more detail in the paper published alongside the Budget on 8 October, &lsquo;The Carbon Tax Increase &ndash; What it Will be Spent On&rsquo;. This paper can be found on the Budget website:</p><p> </p><p><b>Equality Budgeting</b></p><p>An Equality Budgeting pilot was adopted for the 2018 budgetary cycle, built on the existing performance budgeting framework. Equality Budgeting aims to provide greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process, avoid unintended adverse outcomes and enhance the Government&rsquo;s decision making framework. It involves Departments setting concrete measurable targets for equality objectives in the Revised Estimates Volume and reporting on progress in the Public Service Performance Report. For the pilot exercise, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators. The learnings from the pilot were used to inform the expansion of the equality budgeting initiative to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group has also been established. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance Equality Budgeting policy and progress the initiative.</p><p>Future direction will now be assisted by the recent publication of the OECD Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland which sets out a path forward with a number of recommendations for consideration. This work was commissioned by both the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality.  The scan recommendations  are aligned with international experiences of best practice in this field. Implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations will be carried forward in close consultation with the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group. The OECD report can be found at .</p><p><b>Social Impact Assessment</b></p><p>The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) series of papers aims to provide an evidence based methodology to examine the impact of public expenditure on households. This framework is designed to examine the demographic profile of public service users, and how they are impacted by budgetary policy decisions. This approach complements the budgetary impact assessments carried out using the SWITCH (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) model by the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and externally by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). SIA papers published with Budget 2020 focused on topics such as the Domiciliary Care Allowance and Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding for Public Transport. More information about the SIA series is available at .</p><p><b>National Childcare Scheme</b></p><p>The importance and value of quality early years care and education is well-documented. The international evidence shows a wide range of benefits for children, families and society at large. High quality services provide long-lasting cognitive, social and emotional benefits for children, supporting children to enjoy their childhood and realise the full potential of their future. However, affordability and accessibility of quality childcare is a major concern for many parents and can act as a barrier to employment which, in turn, increases the risk of poverty. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay, reduce child poverty and tangibly reduce the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland.</p><p>A Focused Policy Assessment (FPA) on the NCS published by DCYA in October 2018 presented the impacts as:</p><p>- Increased labour force participation amongst parents with children ages 0-15 (incl. female participation) </p><p>- Higher quality childcare provision than currently available </p><p>- Positive outcomes for children </p><p>- Reduced poverty among families with children.</p><p>Taken as a whole, therefore, there is a wealth of information published in the context of Budget 2020 which provides important insights into the wide range of targeted benefits and public service improvements that have been delivered, and to their impact on citizens' lives and wellbeing.</p></reply>

In this regard, it is important to point out that the rules underpinning procurement have not changed due to Brexit, as the procurement Directives already provide for a range of options for trading with third countries. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement in Ireland.  In this context, the OGP published an Information Note on Brexit and Public Procurement in 2017, which has been updated to take account of developments in the interim in December 2018 and June with the most resent iteration being publish last week [link].</p>  <p>  The Information Note sets out the potential risks faced by public bodies that would include disruption to supply, increases in costs, extra administrative burdens, and changes in the regulatory environment.  In addition, to identifying risk, the Information Note emphasises the importance of managing any potential risks to supply and the need to put in place the necessary detailed contingency plans. Such contingencies could include, but are not limited to, buying in bulk and holding stock, and sourcing substitutions and alternative suppliers.</p>  <p>  Whilst the OGP establishes certain aggregated arrangements on behalf of public bodies, the bulk of public procurement remains outside centralised structures. Therefore, it is the responsibility of each public body to ensure the continued delivery of public services as they are best placed to assess and develop contingency planning in relation to their own contracts, including the specific risks associated with Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The OGP has written to all Government Departments advising them to identify and manage any potential risks and to put in place the necessary detailed contingency plans.</p></reply>

Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in 2020.  </p>  <p>  The update of the Public Spending Code highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects focusing on the robustness of planned delivery, accuracy of cost forecasts, and consideration of risk.  My Department is developing a new governance and assurance process for major projects with an estimated cost of over &euro;100 million. This new process is being informed by international best practice and will involve consultation with all major public sector stakeholders. It is likely to involve an independent external review of major projects at key stages. Options are being explored as to how to operate this approach. It may involve external reviews conducted by a panel of experts in infrastructure delivery and may draw on international expertise where relevant. The delivery of such reviews could be done in parallel with other elements of the development of public investment proposed interventions so as not to cause undue delay to those projects which will proceed. The detail of the process and arrangements for implementation will be scoped and developed with a target operational date of mid-2020.</p></reply>

The Government is spending nearly one euro in every five of the education budget on special education &ndash; about &euro;1.9 billion in 2019.  </p>  <p>  We have significantly increased the availability of specialist placements for children with special educational needs as well as bringing more and more children into mainstream education.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides for an additional 1,064 SNA posts and 400 newe special education teacher posts to cater for new need next year.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders was published in July 2016.  The report acknowledges that there has been substantial investment in the education of students with autism over the 14 years since the publication of the last major report on autism in 2001.  The report set out 11 recommendations for further improvement and outlines a range of associated actions to give effect to its recommendations.</p>  <p>  My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared.  </p>  <p>  The group met on three occasions in 2018 and twice to date in 2019 with a further meeting due to be scheduled in the coming weeks. There are further sub-groups continuing to work and research options regarding the implementation of some of the outstanding recommendations.  The work of the Implementation Group is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  A number of the recommendations in relation to school aged provision have been substantially implemented, including those on the development of additional primary and post primary provision, admissions to schools, operating of special classes, additional release days for teaching principals and the use of evidence-informed interventions.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on recommendations relating to on developing teacher knowledge, skills and understanding. My Department intends to publish comprehensive inter agency Good Practice Guidelines on the education of children with Autism in 2020.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that recommendations will be made shortly concerning a revised July provision scheme which would be implemented next year at the earliest.  Before any changes are made to the July provision scheme, there will be consultations with stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The NCSE estimated that implementing the school based recommendations in the report would cost an additional &euro;20m per annum. </p>  <p>  Capitation funding, is intended to contribute towards the cost of heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general up-keep etc. My Department recognises the need to improve capitation funding for schools. Capitation grants are the main funding mechanism for schools to enable them meet their day to day running costs. The levels of capitation grants both primary and post primarty are examined annually as part of the estimates process and in the light of available resources.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provided for a 5% increase in Capitation funding for primary and post primary schools effective from the start of the 2019/20 school year. Over the course of the school year 2019/20, an additional &euro;10 million will be allocated to primary and post primary schools, of which &euro;4 million will be allocated in 2019.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided that schools capitation for all schools will increase by a further 2.5% from September 2020. Enhanced capitation rates will increase by 7.5% from September 2020.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that it is extremely difficult to make valid comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post primary levels.  Primary ASD special classes receive an enhanced capitation grants of &euro;849 per student enrolled inclusive of the mainstream capitation rate (currently &euro;179 per students). Post Primary ASD special classes do not receive enhanced capitation.  However, the Post Primary mainstream capitation rate is &euro;309 per student.</p></reply>

Typically, a two classroom SEN Base is provided in new primary schools and a two or four classroom SEN Base is provided in new post primary schools. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p>  <p>  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

The Guidance Counsellor also provides a referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.  </p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) in my Department provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with identified difficulties.  Consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions delivered in the school setting is also available.  </p>  <p>  When counselling or more specialised intervention is considered to be required, a referral is made to an outside agency.  NEPS supports schools with this onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.</p></reply>

Currently, we spend almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn on supporting children with special needs. </p><p>The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants are at unprecedented levels and so too is the number of children receiving support across the continuum that includes mainstream classes, special classes and schools. Our commitment is provide each child with an education in accordance with his/her need.</p><p>An additional 1,050 specialised places have been provided this school year, with 167 new special classes.  This brings the total number of special class places to over 9,700, almost a trebling provision since 2011. Over 80% of these are ASD special class places. </p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs including ASD. These schools now provide over 8,000 places compared to 6,848 in 2011.</p><p>Budget 2020 provides for an additional 1,064 SNA posts and 400 new special education teacher posts to cater for new need next year.  </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs including special classes for Autism are available by county on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs. </p><p>The Council has well established structures in place to plan and coordinate special education provision throughout the country. </p><p>Normally, special classes are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required</p><p>However there are some parts of the country where the Council faced challenges in getting schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.</p><p>I know that this has caused much anguish for parents and families involved. </p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time back in April in respect of the Dublin 15 area. </p><p>We have made significant progress in a relatively short period with the opening 7 new special classes and a new Special School that will provide 88 places for children with special needs. </p><p>The new places will help these families and ensure that the children concerned have access to education.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows the real and practical challenges that can be addressed when opening new special classes and how we can resolve these challenges by working together and in partnership. </p><p>The NCSE is continuing its work at local level to ensure all children can access a suitable school placement for the forthcoming school year and beyond. </p><p>As Minister, I would much prefer that schools provide places for children in their community.  Where this is not the case, I am prepared to use the legislation to ensure that children can access a suitable education.</p></reply>

This does not preclude new schools established since 2011 from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where it has capacity to do so, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established. </p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.</p></reply>

Earlier in the year, I hosted a symposium on Small Schools which gave me an opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to small schools and to open a dialogue with all the key stakeholders. The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 is the third successive budget to provide for an increase in the number of principal release days.  One additional release day will be allocated to each school with a teaching principal with effect from 1 September 2020.  This will bring the number of release days to 19, 25 and 31, depending on the size of school.  This is an increase from 14, 18 and 22 days since 2015.  In addition, a further four additional release days are allocated to schools with special classes.</p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increase of release days, the Government lifted the moratorium on middle management posts in 2017.  In total almost 1300 leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since 2017 which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  My Department has committed to revising the number of available Posts of Responsibility to take account of retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibilities are maintained in the school system. </p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) including the following new schools to serve the areas referred to by the Deputy:</p><p>- a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in  2019 to serve the Leixlip school planning area,  </p><p>-  a new 8-classroom primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Naas school planning area.</p><p>- a new 500 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Kilcock school planning area to be located in Enfield. </p><p>This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population. </p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  </p>  <p>  On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed by all attendees at the last meeting of the group that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. A response was received on 28 June and has since been shared with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as a primary contributor to the work of the cross-agency group. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area. </p>  <p>  These proposals are receiving detailed consideration in my Department and will be further scrutinised to ascertain whether they can be progressed alongside targeted enforcement measures, awareness raising and youth engagement, which will be key to success in combatting this behaviour.</p></reply>

By contrast, in the old District model, Superintendents would have been balancing this important work with competing priorities such as the investigation of major crime. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner a number of considerations were taken into account in developing the new model and the restructuring of Divisions, including population, geography, projected growth, crime trends and workload across a range of work streams.<b></b></p><p>Under the new model, the existing Meath and Westmeath Divisions will be merged and will form part of the Eastern Garda Region with the new Meath/Westmeath Divisional Headquarters to be situated in Mullingar.  </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that in light of the new structures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is undertaking a review of accommodation requirements, including Mullingar Garda Station.  I am informed that the need for new or additional Garda accommodation or facilities in Mullingar will be considered in the context of that review. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Commissioner last week announced the first 5 Divisions were the new Model will be implemented - Meath/Westmeath will be among these first Divisions, alongside Galway, Cork City, Dublin South Central and Limerick. </p><p>I understand that the new model will be implemented on a phased basis throughout 2020. </p><p>Finally, it may be noted that these changes are being introduced at a time of record investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro; 92 million this year. I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year in addition to &euro;116million in capital investment.  This level of funding will allow the Garda Commissioner to recruit up to 700 new Garda&iacute; next year and additional Garda staff. </p><p>I am confident that this ongoing investment in Garda resources together with the ongoing reform process will result in an improved policing service for all communities, urban and rural, now and into the future.</p></reply>

I am also aware of the misgivings of some groups in respect of the potential for misuse of the technology.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the EU Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive permits data to be retained once it is lawful and fair and for a specific law enforcement purpose. It is important that our national law keeps pace with technological developments and this is being considered in the context of legislation currently being developed as I am determined to ensure that Ireland is fully equipped to combat the rapid developments in all forms of crime and terrorism. </p>  <p>  A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image either from a passport or passport card. My Department&rsquo;s Immigration Service operate automated border control &ldquo;eGates&rdquo; at Dublin Airport which utilise facial recognition technology in order to &ldquo;match&rdquo; arriving passengers with the photograph contained on the chip in their passport. </p>  <p>  The installation of the vb i-match&trade; ABC eGate biometric solution has created a visible clearance option for passengers holding eligible e-Passports or the Irish Passport Identification Cards. In fact, vb i-match&trade; ABC  reads and authenticates both Passports and Irish Passport cards in addition to guaranteeing that only legitimate passengers cross the border.  Systems such as these are now used in border control areas all over the world.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the European Commission has been looking at the use of facial recognition more closely in recent times and has made recommendations in this regard in respect of the use of the technology in developing Schengen area border controls and in systems to support police and law enforcement to capture criminals and terrorists.  These systems are also used to assist in identifying the location of  missing children and vulnerable adults, in line with the EU&rsquo;s data protection rules.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that the EU are considering new regulations in this area that will give EU citizens explicit rights over the use of their facial recognition data. I understand that the aim is to limit the indiscriminate use of facial recognition technology by companies and public authorities.   </p>  <p>  While Ireland does not generally participate in the Schengen systems, my officials are monitoring these developments closely for consideration of any policy or legislative amendments that may be useful and/or necessary in the future.</p></reply>

The Strategy represents a whole of Government approach to bring about meaningful change and progress for the Traveller and Roma community in Ireland.  It brings Government Departments and Agencies together along with representatives of both Traveller and Roma communities to bring a focus to the issues which affect them most in a structured way. I chair the quarterly meetings of the NTRIS Steering Group, which held its most recent meeting on Wednesday 16 October, 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department has allocated &euro;3.9m in funding in 2020 to support a range of Traveller and Roma projects including the provision of core funding to both local and national representative groups. </p>  <p>  In 2019, recipients of Department funding to Traveller projects and NGOs included the Traveller counselling service and an education pilot. The Traveller mediation service was approved funding of &euro;250,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund. Some &euro;25,000 was allocated from the budget to fund the Traveller Pride awards and concert event. The education pilot received &euro;350,000 funding for 2019.

The stamp is valid to the expiry of the non EEA passport in which it is placed.  Applications are only accepted from applicants, whose current permission to remain is due to expire in the next six months. Student permission to remain in the State is not reckonable for this scheme. As this is a Ministerial scheme, successful applicants must not have come to the adverse attention of An Garda Siochana, or be an undue burden on the State. </p>  <p>   The holder of a stamp 3 is permitted to remain in Ireland on the basis that they are dependent on another person who is lawfully resident in the State. The holder of a stamp 3 permission is not permitted to work or claim any State welfare benefits. For example, a Stamp 3 permission can be issued to a  dependent person of a Non EEA national who holds a work permit in the State.  After 8 years they may apply for Stamp 5 permission to remain in the State in their own right.</p></reply>

It will rescue firms with acute liquidity or insolvency problems and support them to put a restructuring plan in place to adjust to their new reality with investment support potentially of up to &euro;10m under state aid rules for firms of all sizes depending on circumstances. </p><p><b>Transition Fund &ndash; &euro;45 million</b></p><p>This Fund will support businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, ranging from food and engineering firms to business process outsourcing firms. It will help those businesses to adapt their business model as needed and adjust to the new trading reality. It is targeted at businesses with 10 or more employees. </p><p><b>Transformation Fund - &euro;8 million </b></p><p>This Fund will be administered by Enterprise Ireland. It will be provided as non-refundable grants supporting larger indigenous firms to transform their business to develop new products and processes, to achieve a step-up in levels of competitiveness and innovation and to assist in diversifying to new markets. There will be initial funding of &euro;5 million for primary food processing companies and &euro;3 million for non-food companies, for example, in traditional engineering sectors. Additional funding for food transformation is also being made available through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p><b>Emergency Brexit Fund for Micro Enterprises - LEO repayable grants &ndash; &euro;5 million</b></p><p>The LEOs will operate a new &ldquo;Micro-Enterprise Emergency Brexit Fund&rdquo;. </p><p>The funding will be provided in the form of a repayable grant worth up to &euro;50,000 through the LEOs, without interest applying and flexible repayment terms determined by agreement with the LEO, which is how the LEOs currently provide grants. </p><p>It is important to reiterate that these supports are designed to mitigate the negative impacts of a No Deal Brexit and will only be activated if no agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p><p>In addition to the supports listed above, in the event of a No Deal Brexit it is envisioned that &euro;45 million will be provided to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The breakdown of the composition of each measure to be activated under the fund is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

This is addressed under Pillar 4 of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland strategy. Pillar 4 is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force as this will lead to the more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce. </p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of Future Jobs Ireland outlines a number of key ambitions and deliverables to help to increase participation in the labour force. A number of these ambitions are centred on flexible working solutions which offer potential benefits for employers, employees and wider society in general. Flexible working encompasses a wide range of practices including part-time, compressed hours, job sharing, home-working and remote working. Such solutions allow for tangible benefits for employees including improving their work-life balance. It also provides solutions for those who would otherwise take unpaid parental leave but cannot afford to do so. </p>  <p>  There are a number of key deliverables under Pillar 4 with the objective of fostering participation in the labour force through flexible working solutions. These include deliverables such as holding a national consultation on flexible working options, the development of guidance for employers on family-friendly working options, and the extension of unpaid Parental Leave. </p>  <p>  A further deliverable under this Pillar is the completion of research on remote working. My Department is currently leading on this research which focusses on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements. The research will also identify the influencing factors for both employers and employees partaking in remote working.</p>  <p>  This research will include desk research, a national employee survey, and one-on-one consultation with key stakeholders. The recent report published by the Financial Services Union on the impact of technology on employees will be considered as a part of this process. The research will also include an international policy review which will consider the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo;, as currently in place in France, in order to understand the impacts of this on remote working. A further input to this project will be the results arising from a Remote Working Stakeholder Forum which I held in the Cavan Digital Hub on 18 July. </p>  <p>  The research will be completed in Q4 of this year and will be published shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

All this information, including details on how to apply for an employment permit, can be found in the Employment Permit section of my Department&rsquo;s website at </p><p>Any application for an employment permit should comply with all of the legislative requirements for the particular employment permit type, including that the non-EEA national has the required immigration permission at the time of application.

Over the years additional funding has been provided for home supports, for transitional care, for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, for aids and appliances and to provide increased capacity in both the acute and community settings.  </p>  <p>  This year, services are being stretched more than ever, with demand consistently outstripping supply and over the last number of weeks we have seen significant increases in delayed transfers of care. While the HSE maximises the use of resources, prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals, there is a growing demand for egress support.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is engaging extensively with the HSE in the context of planning for winter, including the response to the current challenge. An additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year. The HSE were authorised to take immediate action in that regard last month, and released significant support to over 700 people to take up places under the NHSS and over 300 transitional care bed approvals. My Department is continuing active engagement with the HSE with regard to planning for the winter ahead. </p>  <p>  Under Budget 2020, the Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. We have committed to an additional investment of &euro;52 million in Budget 2020 to bring the total funding for home supports to &euro;487 million in 2020. In 2020 the HSE will deliver over 19.2 million hours of home support, representing a substantial increase of 1 million hours more than this year&rsquo;s target.   </p>  <p>  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and, as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand in Winter 2020, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for our older citizens. Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45million has been provided to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme budget. In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment into its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing its total annual budget to &euro;1.03 billion.</p>  <p>  While I am mindful of the present pressures and challenges, there is a need for longer term planning and action. Last year I established an expert working group to carry out an independent expert review of delayed transfers of care. The review was established in recognition of the need to identify focused actions that will ensure that older people who are fit for discharge from hospital are supported to return to their homes and communities as early as possible. The Group reported its findings in November 2018.</p>  <p>  The review recognised that delayed transfers of care are caused by a multitude of factors and it made nine recommendations which include the development of a national policy to provide for a more consistent approach to recording delayed discharges, strengthening data collection, standardising definitions and ensuring consistent discharge guidelines.  The report underlines the importance of hospitals and communities working together to improve patient flow. This is in line with the overall direction of an integrated care approach, expanding community-based care to bring care closer to home, as outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  I subsequently requested the HSE establish an appropriate multi-disciplinary structure to progress implementation of the recommendations. Arising from this a HSE Implementation Group has been established. I have also established and chair a Cross Divisional Oversight Group within the Department of Health to oversee the HSE&rsquo;s implementation of the recommendations. Work is progressing well and last month the HSE hosted a collaborative learning event amongst staff to assist with the development of medium to long-term solutions.</p></reply>

However, certain aspects of the operation of fertility clinics are regulated. SI No. 158 of 2006 (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations govern the quality and safety standards in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells, including gametes and embryos.  Under these Regulations the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is empowered to authorise and monitor tissue establishments involved in the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells intended for human applications.</p>  <p>  Of further relevance is the Children and Family Relationships (CFR) Act 2015, which reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.  Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the  CFR  Act make provision for children conceived through the assistance of a donor.  This includes a requirement for gamete and embryo donations to be made on a non-anonymous basis and the establishment of a National Donor-Conceived Person Register to enable children to access information on their donor and genetically related siblings when they come of age, should they so wish.  Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 will commence on 5th May 2020.</p>  <p>  In addition to these,  the Medical Council provides specific guidance in the area of AHR in the ethical guidelines issued periodically to registered medical practitioners for application in the clinical situations in which they work.  However, these Guidelines have no statutory remit and do not apply to anyone working in the area other than medical practitioners.</p>  <p>  Given the lack of specific regulation in this area, the Government approved the drafting of a bill on assisted human reproduction (AHR) and associated areas of research, based on the published General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill.  This comprehensive piece of legislation encompasses the regulation of a range of practices, including: gamete (sperm or egg) and embryo donation for AHR and research; surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of embryos; posthumous assisted reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research.  The General Scheme also provides for an independent regulatory authority for AHR.</p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health published the report of its review of the General Scheme on 11 July 2019, as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January 2018.  This report will be considered as part of the ongoing process of drafting the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

The additional funding will establish a new health diversion programme for people using drugs, increase awareness of drug-related harms, improve access to HSE addiction services and support initiatives developed by Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. </p>  <p>  &euro;200,000 has been allocated to begin the phased implementation of the Government health diversion programme for people found in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will provide a health screening and brief intervention known as SAOR to people who are referred to the health services by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  &euro;100,000 will be allocated for an awareness campaign about the dangers of drug use, to target high-risk groups such as young people and festival goers. </p>  <p>  &euro;185,000 has been provided to expand services in maternity hospitals for pregnant and post-natal women affected by substance misuse, and their babies. This funding includes the recruitment of additional drug and alcohol liaison midwives. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 also provides for the continued funding of &euro;1m for Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. Of this, &euro;10,000 is being provided in core funding to each of the 24 Drug and Alcohol Task Forces. Funding of &euro;60,000 is being provided for each of the 12 strategic health initiatives which reflect priorities agreed between Task Forces and CHOs. These initiatives target young people, women, families and services users, and homeless people and others with complex needs. It is envisaged a further initiative will be funded on drug-related intimidation. </p></reply>

The Secretary General restated the Government&rsquo;s view that the service should be normalised and available in the community as close to patients as possible.  He also reiterated the Minister&rsquo;s requirement that all nineteen maternity hospitals/units should be able to offer services to women.    </p>  <p>  In April 2019, the Secretary General wrote to the Interim Director General of the HSE to raise concerns in relation to the lack of progress regarding the full implementation of termination of pregnancy services across all maternity hospitals/units. While acknowledging the very substantial work by the HSE to ensure that services were introduced from 1 January, the Secretary General expressed the Minister&rsquo;s disappointment that services were still not available in early pregnancy in all nineteen maternity hospitals and units. The letter requested the HSE&rsquo;s attendance at a meeting with the Minister to detail plans to bring service provision in line with Government policy as quickly as possible. The Interim Director General responded to acknowledge the contents of the Secretary General&rsquo;s letter and to confirm that the HSE would attend the meeting. </p>  <p>  In April there was also an exchange of correspondence between the Department's Acute Hospitals Policy Division and the HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme in relation to the rollout of termination of pregnancy services in the acute hospital sector. The Programme confirmed that termination services in the hospital setting was working well, and demand was within the planning parameters. The hospitals/units providing services were noted and a detailed update was provided in relation to hospitals not providing services in early pregnancy (up to twelve weeks of pregnancy). In response, the Department requested clarification in relation to hospitals not providing services in early pregnancy. </p>  <p>  In May 2019, National Director of Acute Strategy and Planning in the HSE wrote to a Principal Officer in the Department with a briefing note on termination of pregnancy services. The brief detailed the services being provided in hospitals, listed the hospitals providing services in early pregnancy and outlined plans for service expansion in further hospitals.  The Minister also wrote to the Director General in May, requesting a further update on the expansion of termination of pregnancy services in early pregnancy in the remaining maternity hospitals/units across the country. The Minister requested a more detailed report on the HSE &lsquo;My Options&rsquo; telephone helpline, and information on arrangements put in place by the HSE for reviews to be carried out under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2019. </p>  <p>  In June 2019, the Director General replied to the Minister, outlining the plans in place to expand termination of pregnancy services in a number of further hospitals and addressing the approach in the remaining sites.  The Director General provided a report on the My Options helpline, which included details on the number and type of calls received (information / support / counselling).  Finally, he addressed the Minister&rsquo;s request regarding arrangements for reviews under the Act and undertook to provide further information on same. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the HSE to ensure full implementation of the service. </p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro, ongoing investments. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  The HSE received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) in Multiple Sclerosis.</p>  <p>  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress Ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.</p>  <p>  Application 2 is for the use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.</p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded, the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of September 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa. </p></reply>

However, the 10% administrative penalty was waived.  The person named was notified of this decision on 11 April 2018 and he was also given the opportunity to appeal, within 3 months, the decision  to the independent Agriculture Appeal Office.   </p>  <p>  The Agriculture Appeals Office operates independently of my Department. Regulation 5 (2) of the Agriculture Appeals Regulations, 2002, (S.I. No. 193 of 2002), requires an appeal to be made within 3 months from the date of the notification of the Department decision. The deadline for submission of the appeal in this case was 11 July 2018. I am advised that an appeal was submitted to the Agriculture Appeals Office on 12 November 2018, 4 months after the deadline. The person named was advised in a letter dated 12 November 2018 that was issued by the Agriculture Appeals Office that the appeal was received outside the 3 month timeframe. </p>  <p>  In accordance with Regulation 5 (3) of the Agriculture Appeals Regulations, 2002, which provides for an appeal to be submitted late where the Director considers that there are exceptional circumstances, the person named was also informed that if there were exceptional circumstances why the appeal was not lodged by the deadline, it was open to him to write to the Director of Agriculture Appeals by 26 November 2018 outlining any such circumstances and to enclose any relevant documentation. The person named was also provided with the option of contacting the Office of the Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  On 2 April 2019, an e-mail was submitted by the agricultural agent of the person named to my Department&rsquo;s BPS division requesting a further review. This appeal and supporting documentation were forwarded to the Agriculture Appeals Office on the 2 April 2019.  Following an examination of the documentation submitted, the person named was advised that the Director of Agriculture Appeals had determined that the late appeal could not be accepted. I am advised that a further submission was received by the Agriculture Appeals Office from the person named and enclosing further documentation.  That documentation is currently being examined.</p></reply>

The scheme aims to provide a &ldquo;close to home&rdquo; woodland amenity for the local community to enjoy.</p>  <p>  Funding for CCF and NeighbourWood is provided for in the total allocation for all forestry support schemes, which will be &euro;9m in 2020.</p></reply>

From the introduction of the scheme to the end of September 2019, grant support has been provided for the purchase of a total of 8,450 new vehicles to the value of almost &euro;39 million. To date this year, over &euro;17 million has been provided to support the purchase of 3,815 new electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 will see &euro;36 million allocated next year for electric vehicles supports. Of this, &euro;6 million will be provided to support charging infrastructure and &euro;30 million allocated towards purchase grants. As the whole life costs of electric vehicles reduce, the targeting of Government grant support must be adjusted to reflect this. Accordingly, the grant of up to &euro;3,800 for businesses purchasing a new electric car will be discontinued. Businesses can continue to apply for this grant until 22 October provided the vehicle is registered in 2019. However, I do not intend to extend this support beyond the end of this year. </p>  <p>  Businesses purchasing electric vans can continue to avail of the grant. In addition, there is a generous benefit-in-kind tax relief available to support the purchase of battery electric vehicles by businesses.

As part of that growth, 13 new services were successfully secured with Norwegian Air International and Air Canada, both of which used Boeing 737 MAX jet aircraft. Unfortunately, the grounding earlier this year of the Boeing 737 MAX jet aircraft has disproportionally affected Shannon Airport. Separately, and without warning, Kuwait Airlines announced in January last the immediate cessation of its daily trans-atlantic service via Shannon Airport.</p>  <p>  I understand that these developments, which are totally outside the control of Shannon Group, will result in a fall in passenger numbers for Shannon Airport for the first time in six years.  However, I am aware that Airport management are very focussed on addressing these challenges and are in constant discussion with numerous airlines with a view to providing additional flights from Shannon Airport.  The decision to operate a specific air route is however an operational matter for airlines themselves, in consultation with airport authorities.  </p>  <p>  Finally, in 2019, additional funding was made available to Tourism Ireland for its Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund, bringing the total allocation to &euro;1.25 million. This fund seeks to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the Regions.  It is supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders (airports and ports) and matched by air and sea carriers.  This resulted in total cooperative marketing expenditure overseas of &euro;2.5m in 2017 and &euro;2.65m in 2018.  As recently announced following Budget 2020, funding for this Scheme is being increased further to &euro;2.5m in 2020.  I would encourage all regional airports, including Shannon Airport and Cork Airport to continue to avail of this funding to optimise air services and increase connectivity to the regions for passengers. </p></reply>

In performing its regulatory function, its actions include responding to breaches of regulations while respecting fair procedures and natural justice.</p>  <p>  Tusla conducted an inspection of the service in question - which catered for both pre-school and school-age children - in line with the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 in June 2019. During this inspection it was observed that the service, which was approved for a set number of children, was operating outside its registration status, with a substantial number of additional children observed in attendance. Tusla advised the service to revert immediately to its approved registration status, and to take immediate remedial action to address the risk posed to children on the premises due to inadequate insurance. Tusla also referred the service to the local Chief Fire Officer and to the Planning and Enforcement Section of the local Council.</p>  <p>  Tusla carried out a follow-up inspection of the service in September 2019, and found that more children  were attending the service than were approved. Tusla again instructed the service to revert to its approved registration status.</p>  <p>  Tusla also received an application from the registered provider for registration of a school-age service which highlighted that the service has been operating in contravention of its planning permission, which states that the number of children to be accommodated at the facility must not exceed a certain amount.  This has resulted in the regrettable situation described.</p>  <p>  While I appreciate the considerable inconvenience that you reference,  the safety and welfare of children is my foremost priority.  Services must abide by the legislation that is in place to protect our children.</p>  <p>  Tusla continues to engage with the registered provider to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  30 City and Childcare Committees across the country are available to support parents and providers with issues relating to early learning and care and school age childcare. In this instance, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Childcare Committee is available to support parents who need assistance with sourcing alternative service provision and they have been working with local providers to ascertain availability of places, and with new services in the area who intend to create additional places.  </p></reply>

It represents a landmark for parents, underpinned by an innovative IT system, and offering the option of paperless, automated assessment.  We know parents have a lot on their plate, so we are designing an application process that will be as safe, speedy and stress-free as possible.  This means that we have to develop 30,000 different applicant circumstances and choices through the system, to cater for all possible variations.</p>  <p>  The IT system is built and is being piloted at present.  The objective of any pilot is to identify potential issues or &ldquo;snags&rdquo;, and to support readiness for full launch. The pilot has been highly valuable in this regard, allowing us to identify and address a number of issues.  Last week I signalled that a minor snag had been identified which blocked a small number of applications from proceeding through the system.  This has required additional time to address the issue and retest the system.  This means that the Scheme should now open for applications in November.  Subsidy payments, as previously advised, should still flow from November.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the pilot will continue and we will also enable providers to complete programme readiness activities in advance of the full launch.  </p>  <p>  With regard to a specific date for full launch, the Project Board overseeing the Scheme will meet this week and hopes to recommend a new date at that time. </p>  <p>  Allowing these extra few weeks before launching the National Childcare Scheme is the right thing to do.  Parents and providers deserve a robust system and a positive user experience.  It is too important for families for us not to deliver the best possible Scheme and system.</p></reply>

Therefore, all those registered and in receipt of a subsidy under the TEC scheme prior to February 2020, will be entitled to retain that subsidy.  </p>  <p>  While most of those benefiting from legacy schemes will see their level of subsidy rise under the NCS,  persons registered on TEC before February 2020, have the option to either move to the NCS or remain on the TEC scheme for the duration of their eligibility. Information re what subsidy a parent may be eligible to receive under the NCS is available from the NCS Parent Information Line at 01 9068530.</p></reply>

This Act also established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and tasked it with implementing the provisions of this Act.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the NEWB was transferred from the Department of Education to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on its establishment in 2011.</p>  <p>  In January 2014 Tusla, the Child and Family Agency was established and as part of the remit of the Agency, it took on the functions of the former NEWB: chiefly the Educational Welfare Services (EWS). The EWS comprises the statutory functions relating to Educational Welfare Officers; the operationalisation of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme; and the funding of the School Completion Programme (SCP).</p>  <p>  The statutory Education Welfare Service encompasses all recognised schools in the State. The abovementioned legislation mandates that children should be in school from ages 6 to 16 unless they are on the Section 14 register as being home educated or attending an independent school. Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) work with children and young people who are experiencing difficulties with school attendance. EWOs aim to ensure that concerns and problems around attendance are addressed before issues escalate. In doing so, EWOs seek to find solutions within a collaborative intervention framework involving children, their families, schools and other relevant agencies.</p>  <p>  The Act also allows the EWS to prosecute a family in relation to school attendance issues should the family of a child not engage after being referred to Tusla after 20 days non attendance at school. Every effort is made to ensure the child is in receipt of his or her constitutional right to an education prior to legal proceedings being initiated. </p>  <p>  The School Attendance Notice is a final legal notice stating that legal proceedings may be initiated if the family is not in compliance with the notice and the child does not attend school on each school day that the notice is in force. Should the child attend school on each school day that the notice is in force, legal proceedings will not be initiated.</p></reply>

In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his/her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the relevant recommendations made in the Review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be progressed as part of that process. Following consideration of a number of implementation issues arising, in that context, I expect to be in a position to publish the Review.</p></reply>

The plan focuses on increasing the delivery of social housing, with a target of delivering 50,000 social housing homes and 87,000 other social housing supports by 2021.  In 2018, 8,000 new social homes were delivered nationally and this year, a further 10,000 new social homes will be delivered.Budget 2020 has increased funding available to local authorities to provide homeless accommodation and related services to &euro;166m, an increase of &euro;20m on this years budget of &euro;146m. </p><p>My Department publishes a monthly report on homelessness. The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The report captures details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities.

The HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Service Centre within 2 working days of receipt. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  HAP is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. Budget 2019 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;422 million. This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 16,760 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The Exchequer allocation also provides for the recoupment to the HAP SCC the costs associated with the administration of the HAP scheme. HAP SSC staff and administrative costs are recouped quarterly.  The HAP SSC currently have 74 staff. Sanction requests for additional staffing resources were received in Quarter 1 2019.  These were approved by my Department; no additional requests have been received.  </p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord.   The HAP application form comes in two parts, Section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and Section B to be completed by the landlord or agent. An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both Section A and Section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. </p>  <p>  HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP Shared Service Centre.  If there are delays at the processing  stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.  The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>  To support local authorities in the implementation of the HAP scheme my Department provides a once off administrative payment of &euro;150 per HAP household to all local authorities.  This administrative payment recognises the resources required to manage the HAP process.  The payment is made directly to local authorities twice yearly, to offset HAP staffing and administrative costs.  </p>  <p>  At the end of Q2 2019, there were over 48,000 households having their housing needs met via HAP and some 28,000 separate landlords and agents in receipt of monthly HAP payments. My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.</p></reply>

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. </p>  <p>  In 2018, the Board disposed of 39% of planning appeals within the statutory objective period of 18 weeks. This was down from 64% in 2017, mainly due to the impact of the transition to the new Plean-IT system and an increased case-load. However, it should be noted that the total number of appeals disposed of by the Board in 2018 was 2,158, a 24% increase on the previous year.  </p>  <p>  For 2019, the Board has set a target to decide 60% - 70% of planning appeals within the statutory objective period. As of end September 2019, the compliance rate for determining planning appeals within the statutory objective period stood at 67%, up significantly from 38% at the same time in 2018, which is in line with the Performance Delivery Agreement target.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked closely with the Board over the last year or so on a range of measures aimed at increasing its compliance rate with the statutory objective period, including the appointment of additional Board members and the provision of additional resources. Ongoing and planned recruitment processes will see staffing levels increase further in the months ahead.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the impact these measures appear to be having and as such, I have no plans currently to introduce new legislation aimed specifically at increasing the Board&rsquo;s compliance rate. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources to maintain and improve its compliance rate going forward, in line with its Performance Delivery Agreement target.</p></reply>

In this context, Part XA, as inserted into the 2000 Act, sets out the procedure for applications for substitute consent, which is a form of retrospective development consent. The substitute consent process involves the preparation of a remedial environmental impact assessment report or a remedial Natura impact statement, or both as appropriate. </p>  <p>  It is open to any individual who has not already been directed to do so by a planning authority, to consider seeking leave from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under section 177C of the 2000 Act to apply for substitute consent.  Section 177D(2) of the 2000 Act sets out the matters to which the Board must have regard to in deciding to grant leave to apply for substitute consent, which includes that exceptional circumstances exist such that the Board considers it appropriate to allow the opportunity to regularise the development by way of substitute consent.</p></reply>

Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalized, and before affordable dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p><p>In order to support the delivery of affordable homes to buy or rent, the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021 to provide infrastructure support for the delivery of some 6,200 affordable homes. To date, two calls for proposals have been made under the SSF, resulting in funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, being allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes. Of these 35 projects, two of them are in Galway; one in Galway City Council and one in Galway County Council with the potential to support the delivery of a cumulative total of 125 affordable homes.</p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:  </p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible. </p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. </p><p>In order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and the other at Emmet Road in Inchicore. In tandem with these pilot projects, my Department is developing a national policy approach to Cost Rental for Ireland to ensure future projects can be delivered at a scale and in a manner that will have the desired positive impact on the Irish housing sector. </p><p>These new schemes are complemented by other key Government affordability initiatives, including the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the Help to Buy Scheme.  In addition, the Land Development Agency's initial portfolio of sites will have the potential to deliver 3,000 affordable homes and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF related cost reduction, some of which have already come on stream.</p><p>In overall terms, programmes are in place under which some 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF related reduction will be delivered, with some 15,000 households already supported under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan or the Help to Buy Scheme.</p></reply>

My Department wrote again to planning authorities on 2 July and 26 September seeking new or revised estimates following my designation of additional Rent Pressure Zones in certain parts of the country, which extended the application of the short-term letting provisions to these areas. The additional resources sought primarily comprise additional enforcement staff, but also include, inter alia, associated legal costs and IT costs.</p><p>Since then, further communication has taken place between my Department and all relevant planning authorities seeking clarification and refinement of the resourcing requests, as well as in relation to the practical implementation of the short-term letting provisions. </p><p>Additional resources have been provided in Budget 2020 to support local authorities in the implementation and enforcement of the short-term letting provisions.

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.  </p>  <p>  The other main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA) aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. </p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's National Biodiversity Action Plan. The most recent Plan (Ireland's 3rd) was published in October 2017 and includes a number of actions aimed at assisting local authorities throughout the country in their efforts to protect and conserve biodiversity in their areas. Local authorities undertake much valuable work in this sphere and several have produced local Biodiversity Action Plans which are an important element in the overall approach to halting biodiversity loss and protect native species and their habitats. </p>  <p>  My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service will continue to monitor and protect biodiversity through the implementation of the existing legislative framework and in particular will continue to protect and enhance the habitat and species within the designated European Sites. These comprise 439 Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and 154 Special Protection Areas (SPA).</p>  <p>  My Department advises on planning, forestry and EPA licence applications nationally. It also engages in wildlife surveys and monitoring, carries out stakeholder liaison and maintains its educational and awareness raising role with respect to vulnerable species and habitats. My Department also has a remit to comment on a variety of licences under the Wildlife Acts with the aim of helping to protect biodiversity.</p>  <p>  In support of the work carried out by local authorities, I have made a commitment in the coming years to double the funding my Department makes available for local Heritage and Biodiversity Officers to implement biodiversity actions at local level and to tackle invasive species. A pilot grant scheme was introduced in 2018 to assist local authority led biodiversity projects and I am pleased that we have extended this scheme in 2019. </p>  <p>  I look forward to local authorities using the funding available  for projects aimed at tackling invasive alien species in their areas. Invasive alien species are a significant threat to our biodiversity and can also have significant adverse effects in terms of the cost involved in implementing eradication or management measures. I want therefore to enable locally led works and also to raise awareness around invasive alien species and biodiversity matters more generally.</p>  <p>  My Department is also preparing legislation to implement the EU IAS Regulation and this new legislation will strengthen and update existing legislative provisions around the management and control of invasive alien species in Ireland. This is another important measure to protect native species. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Article 17 Report was submitted by my Department to the European Commission in April 2019. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, 85% of habitats are reported as being in Unfavourable status. The main drivers are agricultural practices which negatively impact over 70% of habitats, particularly ecologically unsuitable grazing, abandonment and pollution. The Unfavourable status of many habitats is not surprising as this is the reason they have been listed on the Directive.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in a range of targeted activities to address these issues at regional, national and EU level, and also liaises with other departments, particularly the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to implement policy and practices which will help tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss. </p>  <p>  The status of species is somewhat better: 57% assessed as Favourable and 30% assessed as being in Unfavourable status, with 72% demonstrating stable or improving trends while just 15% demonstrated on-going declining trends. Progress is being made and a number of species such as bats, otter, pine marten and grey seal are doing well.</p>  <p>  Recognising the need for a coherent cross-sectoral response to the biodiversity crisis, earlier this year I announced our 'Seeds for Nature&rsquo;, a range of commitments to be undertaken by public authorities and other stakeholders to drive implementation of actions in the Plan.</p>  <p>  Biodiversity underpins all aspects of our lives and society. Halting biodiversity loss is not simply a matter for a single agency or department. However, my Department is the lead for implementation of biodiversity policy in Ireland and takes this responsibility very seriously and will continue to work across a range of areas, engaging across sectors, to tackle biodiversity loss.</p></reply>
