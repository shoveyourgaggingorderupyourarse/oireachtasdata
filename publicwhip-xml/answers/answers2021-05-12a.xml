The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences.</p><p>The public information campaigns play a vital role in communicating the various strands of the pandemic. All platforms are utilised with some campaigns tailored for different audiences using specific channels. There have been 48 campaigns to date, and each campaign was advertised using a combination of National Press, Regional Press, Radio, Digital Display, Social Media, TV and Online Video. The media buying was engaged through PHD Ltd, and these contracts were placed under the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) Framework Agreement.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-12a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051200073#WRB00700"><p>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the electronic communications sector and the postal sector. It was given regulatory responsibility for the <i>.ie </i>namespace in 2007. The Communications Regulation Act 2007 sets out the terms for the registration of <i>.ie</i>domain names and they enable ComReg to make regulations and to &ldquo;<i>specify an entity as the authority authorised to register &lsquo;.ie&rsquo; domain names&rdquo;. </i>In 2009, ComReg appointed <i>.ie Domain  Registry</i>(IEDR) as the authority authorised to register <i>.ie</i>domain names in accordance with Section 32(4)(a) of the Act of 2007. The decision also stated that IEDR would set up and maintain a Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) which would be the representative group of all stakeholders.  </p><p>IEDR published its policy on Registration and Naming in the .IE, in which it set out the requirements for new registrants, including that they must provide evidence of their real and substantive connection to the island of Ireland. The requirements are set out in Section 2 of the policy document and it states that <i>.ie</i>names are only available to those either based on the island of Ireland, or those who have a real connection to the island of Ireland. Evidence of being based in Ireland can include: a CRO number, Revenue VAT number, registered business number, an Irish VAT number, proof of Irish income tax registration (sole traders), a trademark that is enforceable in Ireland or for individuals it might be a digital copy of an Irish driver&rsquo;s license or Irish passport. If they are based outside of the island of Ireland, a connection to Ireland must be proven. Applicants must show that they trade with, or clearly intend to trade with, consumers or businesses on the island of Ireland. Acceptable evidence of this connection to the island of Ireland includes invoices, press releases, promotional material, or even a screenshot of the registrant&rsquo;s e-commerce store that shows that consumers or businesses can select anywhere on the island of Ireland as their location for delivery. </p><p>IEDR has a process whereby stakeholders can suggest policy changes to IEDR&rsquo;s Policy Advisory Committee (PAC). The PAC was set up in 2014 and it considers and provides advice on policy issues concerning Ireland&rsquo;s Internet top-level domain, <i>.ie</i>to its Board. </p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has no role in relation to the policies and procedures which are used by IEDR. However, the CCPC does have a role in providing information to consumers about online shopping and in January of this year the CCPC published &ldquo;Online shopping post-Brexit: A CCPC consumer guide to shopping online&rdquo;, in which they advised  consumers that a &lsquo;<i>.ie</i>&rsquo; domain does not guarantee that consumers are dealing with an Irish-based business. The CCPC advised consumers that the most important step to take is to check where a business is based before they buy. It advised consumers to check the business&rsquo;s registered address in the terms and conditions (T&amp;amp;Cs) section of the website to find out where the business is registered. The document went on to inform consumers that from 1 January last, all online shopping orders received from the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) are subject to Irish VAT and customs charges, depending on the value and the type of items concerned. Before ordering from outside the EU, consumers are reminded to check the T&amp;amp;Cs to find out what VAT and import charges that they may have to pay. The CCPC also published guidance for businesses selling online emphasising the importance of disclosing the geographic location of their business, as required by the Consumer Rights Directive. Since 1 January, the CCPC have received 25 contacts from consumers on scenarios which would fall within the type of situation outlined here. These cases would include scenarios where consumers have advised the CCPC that they made a purchase for goods from <i>.ie</i>sites and subsequently found out that the traders were actually based in the UK or outside the EU. </p></reply>

The outlook for internationally traded sectors is also uncertain and will depend on developments in export markets.   </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I would like to thank the Deputy for her suggestion about Ireland becoming an EU hub for the events sector and would be interested in hearing about any proposals which I could share with my colleague, Minister Catherine Martin, whose Department is the lead in this area.  </p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, my Department recently launched the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) which gives grants to businesses which are not eligible for the Government&rsquo;s COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity grant or other direct sectoral grant schemes. This scheme aims to help businesses with their fixed costs, for example, rent, utility bills, security.  A payment grant of &euro;4,000 is available for the first quarter of this year. A decision on payment for the second quarter of this year will be made in due course. </p></reply>

With this in mind the Government has put in place a comprehensive package to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Small business assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.  The level of business supports is unprecedented. </p>  <p>  I would urge business owners to seek the supports outlined above if they have not already done so. I would also suggest they contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  While there is a requirement for some schemes for businesses to be operating from a rated premises, in the case of SBASC they do not necessarily have to be the rate payer to qualify.  Our objective is to assist businesses to meet some of the ongoing fixed costs of operating from a premises.   We are not providing compensation for loss of personal income above this level or compensation for loss of profits for any sector.</p>  <p>  I can assure you the Government is continuing to review the range of assistance schemes and eligibility criteria to ensure we have the right mix for the recovery.</p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan, a Micro-generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a public consultation launched in January (now closed) and the submissions received are currently being reviewed, with a view to publication of the final scheme design, subject to Government approval, in the coming months.    While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is envisaged that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published an updated Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in February, which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for prosumer development later this year. </p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to a household under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,819 in 2020.   Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Individual applications to the Warmer Homes Scheme are an operational matter for the SEAI and as Minister I have no role in such matters. However in reference to the case raised by the Deputy, I have been informed by the SEAI that the application for the home in question was received in January and is currently awaiting a survey allocation. </p>  <p>  There are currently approximately 8,000 homes on the scheme work programme. This includes homes that: are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting initial survey. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget allocation, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. </p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards our 70% renewable electricity target by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions.  Most recently, my Department commissioned an independent report incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector and the report from the International Expert Commission was published in October 2018. It found that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this piece of critical electricity infrastructure. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, I have decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Terms of reference for this study were published on my Department's website on 21 April and are also attached for ease of reference. On 7 May, my Department launched a procurement using the appropriate procurement framework administered by the Office of Government Procurement. </p></reply>

It has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company.</p><p>Since the November 2016 Private Members' motion referred to by the Deputy was debated, a lot of work has been done to ensure An Post and the post office network remain viable.</p><p>An Post put in place a Strategic Plan, covering the period 2017 &ndash; 2021, in response to the structural challenges faced by the postal sector. As part of the delivery of the plan the company was split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p><p>An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p><p>An Post has also launched its Green Hub, a facility providing end-to-end project management and financial advice for all levels of home retro-fitting which will be supported by competitive loan rates. The Green Hub is essentially a one-stop-shop which will cover loan-only or full retro-fit services, from initial home assessments to completed works and an SEAI grant application and payment process. An Post has partnered with SSE Airtricity to give free home assessments and the fulfilment of works.</p><p>Government efforts have been focussed on supporting An Post in the roll out of new services and the delivery of its strategic plan. &euro;30m in State funding was made available, of which &euro;15 million is to support the renewal of the post office network and a further &euro;15 million towards the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mail delivery service.  This helps secure the future of mail and post office services for local communities throughout the country in both rural and urban areas. </p><p>An Post has received an investment loan of &euro;40m from the European Investment Bank to finance innovation and modernisation projects as part of its strategic plan. The borrowing is being used to help fund the capital costs associated with five investment programmes which are part of the Transformation Plan, including Post Office renewal.</p><p>Government continues to provide significant business to An Post through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Social Welfare contract and National Treasury Management Agency business. A Capital Expenditure programme was approved at Ministerial level which, as part of the Company&rsquo;s commitment to the sustainability of its network, is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post&rsquo;s Financial Services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the Retail side of the business.</p><p>In line with its commercial strategy to increase its banking services, An Post announced a new partnership with Bank of Ireland to offer personal and SME withdrawal and lodgement services to Bank of Ireland customers across the An Post network of over 900 post offices nationwide. This builds on the agency banking services An Post already provides for a number of other leading banks including AIB and Ulster Bank with more than 4.5 million transactions and a cash value of almost &euro;1.5bn annually.</p><p>The Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. In that regard, Government recently approved the Report on the Provision of Offline Government Services and the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Group, co-chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to, <i>inter alia,</i>examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network. The Group has met twice in the past 3 weeks and will report back to Government by the end of July.</p><p>Government is committed to delivering services using channels geared to the needs of the public and remains committed to a sustainable Post Office Network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.</p><p>All options will be considered fully and every effort made to give effect to the Government commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to a household under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.As indicated in the table below, there are currently 779 homes in Cork on the Warmer Homes work programme. The scheme operates nationally on a first come first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months in Cork and nationally. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between March and June of last year as well as between January and 12 April of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme has now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p><p>The SEAI has advised me that the average wait times should only ever be used as a general guide and that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather. </p><p>It is important to note that funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p><p>In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered. </p><p>This table shows a breakdown by county of the total national Warmer Homes work programme.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. on warmer homes work programme </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>102</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>147</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>779</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>390</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>2404</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>391</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>238</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>256</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>104</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>96</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>93</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>263</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>74</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>157</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>391</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>271</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>138</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>144</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>123</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>292</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>213</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>184</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>287</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>236</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>7945</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The current legislation allows a learner driver to renew their learner permit for a third time on condition that they can show evidence that they have either sat, or applied to sit, a driving test. An applicant who provides evidence of having sat a driving test will receive  a two year permit renewal. An applicant who provides evidence that a driving test has been arranged will recieve a one year permit.</p>  <p>  A person must be in possession of a valid learner permit in order to sit a test. In cases where a permit expires before a scheduled test could take place, a facility to renew the permit is required. This provision was particularly necessary when waiting times for driving tests were particularly long. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of people driving on our roads on their 4th, 5th, 6th or subsequent learner permit.  A learner permit is not a licence, but a permit to allow a person to drive while learning. </p>  <p>  In October 2019, the Road Safety Authority sent proposals to my Department in relation to this issue. These proposals were examined and a submission was prepared for Ministerial approval. The measures set out in the submission took account of the shorter wait times for tests and the increased tester resources available at the end of 2019 as the opportune time to tackle the issue. Due to the restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, a review of the draft submission is now required. With the current backlog pending due to the halting of driving tests, it is prudent to delay any changes to regulations for long term permit holders in the short term, or until the driving test service is stabilised.</p></reply>

Galway Harbour Company does not meet the criteria laid out in National Ports Policy to be designated as a Port of National Significance (Tier 1 or 2):  Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) are ports that are responsible for 15% to 20% of overall tonnage through Irish ports, and Ports of National Significance (Tier 2) are ports that are responsible for at least 2.5% of overall tonnage through Irish ports.  Galway Port&rsquo;s average market share of national total tonnage handled since corporatisation in 1997 averages around 1.5%.  Therefore, it is designated as a Port of Regional Significance.</p>  <p>  Galway Harbour is also not included in the EU&rsquo;s Trans European Network for Transport (TEN-T) as it does not meet the qualification criteria. </p>  <p>  However,  in December 2020 officials from my Department and Galway Harbour Company met with officials from the European Commission to explore the potential for the inclusion of Galway Harbour Company on the comprehensive network. The European Commission&rsquo;s position was that whilst a review of the TEN-T Regulation was being conducted, the design and qualification criteria for inclusion on the TEN-T Comprehensive Network should remain as is with some minor adjustments.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing review of the TEN-T Regulation, officials from my Department met with the European Commission again in March of this year. At this meeting, it was once more highlighted that the current methodologies being used for inclusion on the comprehensive network do not provide for the potential role that ports such as Galway Harbour can play in contributing to the EU Green Deal. </p>  <p>  Outside of these meetings, my Department has engaged with the Conference of Peripheral and Maritime Regions to discuss the possibility of additional criteria being added to the TEN-T Regulation to allow for the inclusion of ports, particularly those in the Atlantic Region, on the Comprehensive TEN-T Network.</p>  <p>  It is intended that officials from my Department will have a further meeting with the European  Commission on the ongoing review of the TEN-T regulation. At this meeting, the inclusion of Galway Harbour on the TEN-T comprehensive network will again be raised.  At that stage, a proposal on the matter will be formally made to the Commission. </p></reply>

To deal with the backlog, the RSA have plans to increase capacity when it is allowed to re-open. This additional capacity will see the number of tests increase from an average pre Covid19 output of 15,000 tests per month to 50,000 per month. This will help significantly to tackle the backlog.</p>  <p>   The RSA is working to deliver an online driver theory test service. A pilot online driver theory test is underway for trucks and buses.

The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the Free Travel Scheme.   In Budget 2020, and prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, over &euro;300 million was provided for PSO and Local Link services.  Due to the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in the collapse of fare revenue on public transport, a further &euro;370 million (in addition to the c. &euro;300m already provided) was allocated to enable the continued operation of public transport services in 2020.   My primary focus is to ensure that public transport services continue to operate during this pandemic, and I secured almost &euro;659m for PSO services in 2021, of which &euro;30m is to support the licensed bus sector.   </p>  <p>  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  I have, therefore, forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The objective of the mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households and to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. </p>  <p>  The macroprudential measures apply loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. The LTI limit is 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income. For second and subsequent buyers, the LTV limit is 80% of the value of the residential property (i.e. a deposit of 20% is required from the house purchaser). A mortgage deposit can help households to absorb a certain reduction of house prices before the borrower falls into negative equity. </p>  <p>  Allowances to exceed the LTI limit and LTV limit have been central to the framework of the mortgage measures since their introduction. The allowances acknowledge that higher LTI and LTV mortgages can be appropriate in certain circumstances. Mortgage lenders are allowed to issue up to 20 per cent of the value of new mortgage lending to second and subsequent buyers at LTVs above 80 per cent. This could include borrowers in the specific circumstance referenced by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  The allocation of allowances is a matter for individual lenders, based on an evaluation of each specific borrower and the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies. The mortgage measure limits are in addition to individual banks' credit policies and are not a substitute for lenders&rsquo; responsibilities to assess affordability and lend prudently.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, subject to the requirement to comply with the provisions of the macro-prudential mortgage lending rules, the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements, it remains the responsibility of an individual lender to assess the credit worthiness of an individual and to decide whether or not to provide a loan in any particular case, or how much credit to provide in any particular case. </p></reply>

It focuses primarily on business eligibility, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis to the employer. The objective of the EWSS is to support businesses, encourage employment and help to maintain the link between employers and employees. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;500 million have been granted to 48,900 employers in respect of 558,000 workers.</p>  <p>  The EWSS &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by Covid-19 by requiring a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations. The primary employer qualification for the EWSS is based on the employer's turnover in the current six-month period being less, compared with the same pre-pandemic position period in 2019. The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that it is operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from 1 January to 30 June 2021 compared with the equivalent period in 2019. </p>  <p>  To answer the specific point raised in the Deputy's question, the turnover qualification requirement for EWSS applies regardless of whether the business is required to close fully or partially due to public health restrictions, or indeed if the business could remain open throughout the pandemic. The &ldquo;turnover test&rdquo; is the determining factor as regards eligibility for the EWSS and accordingly, the business must have suffered at least a 30% decrease in its turnover and this disruption is due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The EWSS is designed to be flexible for the employer and take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover so if there is a reduction in turnover in the future because of a change in circumstance the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that later period.   </p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s position remains that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Reflecting this, sustainable finance is a specific horizontal priority within the Government&rsquo;s current strategy for the further development of the international financial services sector, &lsquo;<i>Ireland for Finance&rsquo;</i>. </p><p>The Strategy aims to make Ireland a leader in the field, in particular through further enhancing and deepening the base of expertise and activity in sustainable finance that we already have here. </p><p>To this end, the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Action Plan 2021 has 10 (from the 46 overall) action measures which will progress the sustainable finance agenda. These include the development and delivery of training and education programmes to build capacity and expertise in the industry in Ireland, as well as a &lsquo;deep dive&rsquo; into Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) data needs to measure progress and identify barriers in advancing this agenda. Additionally, an assessment of outstanding issues with identifying and managing biodiversity impacts, dependencies and associated financial sector risks is being undertaken.</p><p>More broadly Ireland has been active with an increasingly important role in international efforts to accelerate the sustainable finance agenda, including through our role in the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, and the Central Bank&rsquo;s involvement with the international Network for Greening the Financial System.</p><p>This is in addition to my Department's input and work across International Financial Institutions (IFIs) such as the IMF and World Bank where sustainable finance and climate action are central areas of interest especially in the development of post-Covid recovery measures. Other IFIs such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), where Ireland is an active member, are implementing strategies for the coming decades to ensure that at least 40% of their funding for new projects will be climate-related as part of an overall objective of transitioning to green low carbon economies by 2030 and net zero by 2050.</p><p>At EU level, I welcome the work being undertaken by the EU Commission in developing a renewed strategy for sustainable finance, in particular by progressing the transition by boosting sustainable investments and by moving sustainable finance beyond climate objectives.</p><p>Similarly, the EU&rsquo;s Green Taxonomy regulation, and the disclosures directive, which will form the cornerstone of the new regulatory regime, are major steps forward. Their implementation will be instrumental in identifying, measuring and helping remove barriers to the advancement of our common sustainable goals in the years ahead.</p></reply>

The Group advocates that the emphasis must always be on remembrance and commemoration of locally significant historical events and the avoidance of any sense of celebration.  My Department has developed comprehensive guidance for the allocation of funding to assist local authorities.  However, it is, of course, within the discretion of individual local authorities to provide support from within their own resources to local communities who wish to erect and maintain monuments, where this is deemed the appropriate approach.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that local authorities will receive a number of requests from commemorative committees and community groups seeking support for the erection of monuments and other memorials as we navigate through the sensitive forthcoming period of commemorations.  While we recognise that these incidents and actions are undoubtedly of great local significance in the narrative of the part played by individual counties during the Struggle for Independence and Civil War, this is just one element within the Community Strand of the overall Decade of Centenaries Programme.  </p>  <p>  There is scope for a rich diversity of interesting and engaging commemorative initiatives to be curated from within the annual funding allocation from my Department to each of the local authorities.

These funds support artists, arts organisations and production companies to sustain through this crisis period and make a vital contribution to the recovery of our society. </p><p>This additional funding includes a &euro;25 million allocation for the Live Performance Support Scheme, part of a &euro;50m suite of measures to support the live entertainment sector and provide vital support and opportunities for continued activity in the sector. The measures are aimed at providing significant job contracts for all workers in the live entertainment sector, including musicians, actors, crew and technicians. The supports in place also ensure that artists and arts workers will be well placed to avail of international opportunities once it is safe to do so thereby reaffirming Ireland's global cultural reputation.</p><p>The Government encourages the development of sustainable, high skilled sectors that add productive value though domestic and international activity. Ireland is constantly developing our European relations for the benefit of artists and professionals. In relation to European touring by artists and professionals, Ireland  is currently represented through Music From Ireland's Vice Chairmanship of the European Music Exporters Exchange. They have delivered a comprehensive report to the European Commission which aims to generate new knowledge and approaches to European music export through research and innovative pilot actions and are currently working on the delivery of an Export Toolbox for European artists and professionals.

The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The Taskforce was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. </p>  <p>  I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society; it includes a broad mix of employment types. This is an exciting proposal and has been the subject of positive commentary both nationally and internationally. We can now work to see how it can be enhanced.  </p>  <p>  I have established an Oversight Group with the remit of addressing the outstanding recommendations of Life Worth Living.  The membership of the Group is drawn from departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations, and to whom recommendations of the Taskforce are addressed.  </p>  <p>  The Oversight Group is being chaired by my Department joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members and they will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association. </p>  <p>  I have asked the Oversight Group to prioritise the examination of Recommendation 1, a basic income for artists. I have engaged with relevant Ministerial colleagues on this matter and they have indicated their support for developing proposals. This would be independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the Programme for Government  commitment to pilot a Universal Basic Income within the lifetime of this Government commitment. I intend therefore to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine Universal Basic Income, informed by a review of previous international pilots, and resulting in a universal basic income pilot in the lifetime of the Government.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has requested the Low Pay Commission to examine the commitment in the Programme for Government and the Commission has agreed that this request will form part of its workplan for 2021.  The terms of reference for the study on Universal Basic Income are currently being finalised by the Commission and research is due to begin shortly.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby facilitating more widespread generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.</p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for "glint and glare" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, my Department has decided to adopt an interim measure which would allow revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations. My Department has consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter, and has developed draft interim regulations in this regard. </p>  <p>  These draft regulations have now been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC, and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals, which will include public consultation as part of the process. This process is expected to take between four and five months to complete. </p>  <p>  Following the public consultation and consideration of any submissions received, and as required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  The process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in Q4 2021. These interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed by Q4 2021. The final supplementary set of regulations will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner.</p></reply>

These Directives aim to ensure the protection of habitats and species which have been selected for conservation within special areas of conservation and special protection areas.</p><p>Significant efforts have been made by the State to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas within the framework of the Habitats Directive. This has included the establishment of the Peatlands Council, intensive and on-going engagement with turf cutting interests, the farming community, non-governmental organisations and with the European Commission, as well as the establishment of a long-term compensation scheme for affected turf cutters.</p><p>The Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme (CTCCS) was established in 2011 for domestic turf cutters arising from the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation and was extended in 2014 to include raised bog natural heritage areas. This scheme is applicable to turf cutters who have been affected by the designation of raised bogs as special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas encompassed by the scheme and who fulfil the qualifying criteria of the scheme. It is comprised of a payment of &euro;1,500 per annum, index-linked, for 15 years, or relocation, where feasible, to a non-designated bog, together with payment of &euro;500 on the signing of a legal agreement under the scheme. </p><p>2590 applicants are regularly receiving compensation under the scheme. There are other affected turf cutters, who may qualify under the scheme, who have not yet applied. I would encourage them to do so.</p><p>While applicants are waiting for relocation sites to be investigated, prepared and developed, they may, on an interim basis, opt for the annual payment of &euro;1,500 (index-linked) or opt to receive an annual supply of up to 15 tonnes of cut turf delivered to their homes. To date, 1,215 deliveries of turf have been made to applicants.</p><p>Of the 2,590 applicants regularly receiving compensation under the scheme, 185 have applied for relocation to a non-designated bog.</p><p>The total spend to the end of 2020 on payments, turf deliveries and relocation under the CTCCS was &euro;46.9 million, the breakdown of this expenditure per year is as follows:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Expenditure under the CTCCS </th>       <th>Applicants Availing of the CTCCS </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2011 </td>       <td>&euro;45,000 </td>       <td>30 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2012 </td>       <td>&euro;3,919,459 </td>       <td>1772 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013 </td>       <td>&euro;4,871,983 </td>       <td>1880 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014 </td>       <td>&euro;4,931,018 </td>       <td>1972 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015 </td>       <td>&euro;4,615,579 </td>       <td>1982 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>&euro;5,211,280 </td>       <td>2197 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>&euro;5,695,973 </td>       <td>2346 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>&euro;6,202,841 </td>       <td>2475 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>&euro;6,432,279 </td>       <td>2546 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>&euro;5,031,520 </td>       <td>2461 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>&euro;46,889,952 </td>       <td>N/A </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The expenditure to date in 2021 is in the region of &euro;1.5 million, with 732 applicants having already received a compensation payment for 2021. 14 applicants have been relocated to non-designated bogs in 2021 to date.</p></reply>

This grant can be claimed on its own or in addition to either the grant for rehabilitation works or the grant for a new well.</p><p>In implementing the revised arrangements, my Department has undertaken to conduct a review of the grant scheme after one year of operation to ensure its alignment with policy objectives.</p></reply>

Customer Service Information was also provided to over 40,000 citizens via our Webchat service during this time.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is now processing all Passport Online applications. It is expected that the 89,000 applications on hand at the end of April will be processed by the end of June. Significant progress has been made thus far with over 16,000 applications processed since 4 May. </p>  <p>  Passport Online will continue to be the priority given the efficiencies that are in-built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is four times as fast as a paper application. In addition, the use of Passport Online can facilitate social distancing, given that a renewal application for an adult does not require the signature of a witness.</p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p>  <p>  At present, there are approximately 106,000 Passport Online applications in the system. This figure includes the approximately 17,000 new applications received by the Passport Service during the first week of scaled-up services. The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand, and we are confident, taking into account measures to ensure a safe workplace, that any Passport Online backlog can be cleared in six to eight weeks.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service plans to resume processing of paper based applications such as Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express once online applications have been processed. There are currently approximately 1,600 paper based applications in the system.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is no requirement, at this time, to allocate additional staff to the Passport Service. Similar to all work places, social distancing is required so this limits the occupation of buildings but my Department has been working closely with the Office of Public Works on this matter.</p></reply>

The EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo; represents an opportunity to renew efforts to put in place such arrangements. Discussions on the Pact are continuing within the Justice and Home Affairs Council though progress to date has been limited. For its part, Ireland has been clear in urging compromise and solidarity with frontline states as well as support for EU efforts to deal with migration in a comprehensive and holistic manner, including through resettlement and increased legal pathways for migration; addressing root causes of migration and reforming the Common European Asylum System.</p>  <p>  In regard to the specific situation in Lesbos, in 2019 there were 42,000 people hosted in camps on the Greek islands, in conditions that were extremely difficult. That number is now 14,000, with under 8000 on Lesbos. While this is still too high, and conditions are still a clear issue, strong efforts are being made to further improve the situation. The European Commission has dedicated over &euro;155 million to building new reception centres on Lesbos and Chios, and a further &euro;121 million for smaller centres on Samos, Kos and Leros. These new centres, when finished, will help address the problem of overcrowding.</p>  <p>  In December, Ireland also provided UNICEF Greece with a contribution of &euro;225,000 in respect of the response to the Moria fire on Lesbos. This contribution complements the considerable Irish Aid humanitarian support to refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.</p>  <p>  The situation of refugees on the Greek Islands does not arise directly on the UN Security Council agenda. However, Ireland uses all available opportunities to highlight humanitarian and human rights issues, including the plight of refugees worldwide, through the UN&rsquo;s structures and in other multilateral formats.</p>  <p>  Concerning plans to take in refugees, on 1 October 2020, Minister McEntee announced that Ireland would accept 50 refugees in family groups from Lesbos. Ireland also has an existing commitment to accept 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece. Eight of these minors arrived in Ireland last June. Staff from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, along with staff from T&uacute;sla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to interview 25 unaccompanied minors and 50 people in family groups, with a view to arranging their relocation to Ireland.</p></reply>

It sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has established vaccine prioritisation which is in line with this national allocation strategy. Initial Vaccination priority is for Defence Force personnel who are providing front line support to the HSE and National Ambulance Service in the national effort to combat COVID 19. </p>  <p>  Personnel selected for deployment to overseas missions fall into a prioritised grouping and they are vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to deployment, subject to availability of the vaccine which is coordinated through the HSE. This approach is in line with UN guidelines which requests Member States to vaccinate troops prior to deployment where feasible. </p>  <p>  There may, however, be a small number of Defence Force personnel who, for a variety of reasons, will not be vaccinated against Covid 19 prior to their deployment and planning is ongoing in relation to facilitating the vaccination of these personnel at the earliest possible opportunity. </p>  <p>  Most peacekeeping personnel deployed to UN missions from member states should receive the COVID-19 vaccine through their own national or host country vaccination programmes and according to the timelines and prioritisation guidelines of those programmes. The UN Department of Operational Support (DOS) is working to ensure alternative arrangements are put in place for personnel who deploy to UN missions not fully vaccinated. </p>  <p>  With regard to the vaccination of Defence Force personnel in theatre to date, I am advised by the military authorities that the following is the position:</p>  <p>  - Twelve (12) Defence Force personnel have received vaccines organised by UNIFIL headquarters;</p>  <p>  - 26 personnel deployed in the  UNDOF mission and six (6) personnel deployed with UNTSO have received a COVID-19 vaccination on the ALPHA (Israeli) side through the Israeli administered programme; and</p>  <p>  - eleven (11) personnel deployed in the MINUSMA mission in MALI have received a vaccination through the German contingent in the Mission area. </p></reply>

The contract commenced on 1st July 2012 for a period of 10 years, with an option to extend for a further 3 years. The existing contract has been extended for one year to 2023 to facilitate the lengthy procurement process and ensure compliance with the Public Spending Code. </p>  <p>  A strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the Public Service Code was brought by the Department of Transport to Government for information in July last year. The preliminary appraisal included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the state assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard Aviation Branch. Both were ruled out for a variety of reasons but notably the risks to the state and questions around potential affordability and deliverability. I agree with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal mentioned above and I do not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for SAR services in Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue domain.  </p>  <p>  I have acknowledged previously that I would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service, given their historical role in this area. In this context, late last year, I asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for SAR and represents value for money for the State.  This process is currently ongoing. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next SAR marine aviation service will be a matter for Government once the detailed appraisal and business case has been finalised by the Department of Transport. </p></reply>

SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making such recommendations, as set out in Circular 0010/2013.</p><p>In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.

The professional reports received to date do not clearly illustrate how, when and in what way the equipment will be used to access education throughout the school day.</p><p>-  While it is acknowledged that the pupil in question is using technology in the special class, there is little information on what type of technology, how or when it is being used, or what technology is available in the special class throughout the school day</p><p>-  Equipment currently available in the school can meet the needs as outlined in the report &ndash; The School&rsquo;s  information has not provided a case to the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) why the current technology available in the school and the special class is insufficient to meet the pupil&rsquo;s educational needs. </p><p>Should additional information become available, which provides further clarification regarding the requirement for assistive technology for the pupil in question, in accordance with the terms of the scheme, it will be open to the school to resubmit an application for consideration.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. </p>  <p>  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. </p>  <p>  I have made enquiries in the matter of the individual raised in the Deputy's question and can inform him that NEPS first began to work with this student over four years ago.  During his time in primary school, the student had a full psychological assessment and review completed by the school&rsquo;s NEPS psychologist and was also the subject of ongoing consultations. </p>  <p>  On the student&rsquo;s transfer to post primary school the NEPS service continued to provide consultative support to the school advising on how best to promote positive outcomes for this student.  As is always the case, and in line with the NEPS model of service, the assigned psychologist is available to the school to discuss this student&rsquo;s needs and indeed the merit of further formal assessment. I would advise therefore that if his parents have concerns in relation to his educational, social or emotional development these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he is attending, with a view to discussing the situation with the school's assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

This decision was taken to provide choice and clarity for students. </p><p>Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades is essential to ensuring a fair system, having regard to the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closure. </p><p>This decision followed intensive engagement with education stakeholders bilaterally and through the Advisory Group on Planning for State Examinations 2021 and ensures for every student a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.</p><p>Students have registered for the traditional examinations and/or to receive SEC-Accredited Grades on a subject-by-subject basis on the Candidate Self-Service Portal.

Proficiency Assessments for candidates seeking an Accredited Grade in respect of non-curricular languages were also held last weekend. Leaving Certificate Applied oral examinations started on 3 May.</p><p>My Department and the State Examinations Commission has published a series of guides for both students and schools regarding the processes for the 2021 Leaving Certificate. This includes <i>A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021</i>as well as detailed guides on the Accredited Grades processes for schools. These guides, and further information, are available on <i>www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate.</i></p><p>On 25 March, I announced details of the additional supports that are being provided to schools to support the running of the Leaving Certificate and Leaving Certificate Applied Examinations and the Accredited Grades process.</p><p>Schools can appoint a Leaving Certificate Aide to support school management in the planning, preparations for and running of the examinations, and the work involved in the Accredited Grades process including work related to providing estimated marks for out of school learners and students studying subjects outside of school.</p><p>The measures are designed to support schools and ensure that essential work for Leaving Certificate 2021 can take place. The arrangements recognise that certain work is required to be carried out outside the normal time in which such work is undertaken.</p><p>Schools are able to appoint an Aide from within the school, to conduct the planning and organisation work associated with the oral examinations and to assist with the administration of the June examinations and the Accredited Grades process.  The number of days available ranges from 50 to 60 days depending on the number of candidates in the school and the range of activities that are required to meet the needs of candidates in that school. </p><p>Full details of these arrangements have been advised to schools by the State Examinations Commission Circular 15/2021.</p><p>My Department is also supporting school leaders, teachers and other school personnel, tutors, parents and students through a dedicated phone-line and e-mail service for queries on the Accredited Grades process. </p><p>In the coming days, the SEC will be issuing further guidance for the conduct of the written examinations to schools that is in line with public health advice and which will ensure that the examinations can proceed safely. </p><p>The most current information on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate examinations and the Accredited Grades process will be available on an ongoing basis on gov.ie/LeavingCertificate.</p></reply>

Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p><p>The terms of reference for this review are currently being established, following which, the group or body which will carry out the review, and the timeline for the review, will also be agreed.  </p></reply>

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting, be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  This approach to supporting wellbeing has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements in mental health.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:</p>  <p>  -  The National Educational Psychological  Service (NEPS)  Guidance  Counselling service/provision  </p>  <p>  -  National Council for Special Education (NCSE)   </p>  <p>  -  Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team </p>  <p>  -  Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service</p>  <p>  -  Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI)</p>  <p>  At post primary level, a Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.   The total number of guidance counsellor posts in the school year 2020/21 is 852. </p>  <p>   Separately, the Department of Health has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland, and through HSE Primary Care Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provides clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  In addition, the HSE and its funded providers, provide e-mental health services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include services provided by the Samaritans, Pieta House, MyMind, Turn2Me, Aware, Crisis Text Ireland, Shine, BeLongTo, LGBT Ireland, Jigsaw, spunout, Bodywhys and Childline. </p>  <p>  My Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people. </p></reply>

This is set out in the legislative provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 governing entitlement to the benefit.

IPAS will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that arrangements to re-accommodate applicants in their original IPAS accommodation, or as close to it as possible, can be made in advance.  </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, IPAS has made every effort to retain accommodation for residents who chose to avail of the HSE temporary accommodation scheme or who decided to move to other temporary accommodation during the pandemic.  However, it has not been possible in every case to retain the original accommodation.  For instance, where the accommodation premises is no longer retained under contract with my Department or where a centre has been re-profiled in terms of its room make-up to meet changing demands, the accommodation may no longer be available. </p>  <p>  Another issue that has arisen is that IPAS has not always been made aware that a resident who left their IPAS accommodation centre was working in the healthcare sector and left to take up accommodation in temporary HSE accommodation.  In such cases, the resident&rsquo;s original accommodation may not have been retained.  In these circumstances, the healthcare workers would be required to re-apply for IPAS accommodation.</p>  <p>  In such circumstances, IPAS will endeavour to ensure that alternative like-for-like accommodation is provided as close as possible to their previous accommodation.  Persons who wish to return to their IPAS accommodation should engage with the IPAS as soon as possible to ensure that the most appropriate accommodation available is provided.  Any resident returning to IPAS accommodation must quarantine in an IPAS isolation facility for a period of 14 days prior to moving to IPAS accommodation.  This is to reduce the risk of Covid infection within accommodation centres. </p></reply>

This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Data from the 2018/2019 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision, in general, meets current demand nationwide in terms of capacity, whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.  </p><p>In 2018/2019, 4,598 services were contracted to deliver at least one (then DCYA) funded programme. </p><p>The Early Years Sector Profile report also provides numbers of services at a Local Authority level. </p><p>The breakdown can be seen in Table 1. </p><p>Capacity within the sector is calculated using figures reported by the services on the number of children enrolled and vacant places (capacity is the sum of children enrolled and vacant places). </p><p>The overall reported capacity of the sector in 2018/19 was 188,705. The Early Years Sector Profile report 2018/2019 had a response rate of 85%. This can then be extrapolated to a national capacity of 218,745, a 2% increase on the previous year.</p><p>The Early Years Sector Profile report also provides reported capacity at a Local Authority level. These figures are not extrapolated. These figures can be found in Table 2.</p><p>My Department continues to monitor the data from the Early Years Sector Profile report closely to inform policy going forward.

The 2019/2020 report is due to be published this summer. </p><p>A key policy objective of my Department is to improve affordability, accessibility and quality of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). A 141% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised ELC and SAC. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available. </p><p>First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to build on this progress. Among key strategic actions in First 5 is a commitment to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised ELC and SAC to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'. </p><p>To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including an update of the National Planning Guidelines for the development of ELC and SAC settings, the extension of regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis and the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040. The development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC also seeks to address issues of accessibility. </p><p>More information can be found at:<i> </i></p><p>Table 1 <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Number of Providers</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>67</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>138</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City</td>       <td>96</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>388</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>154</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin-Dublin City</td>       <td>445</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin-Dun-Laoghaire-Rathdown</td>       <td>185</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin &ndash;Fingal</td>       <td>326</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin- South Dublin</td>       <td>255</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>288</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>138</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>201</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>201</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>120</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>136</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>196</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>61</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>58</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>76</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>180</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>95</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>89</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>146</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>176</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2  <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>Current capacity per county (enrolled and vacant places) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>2608 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>3536 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>4798 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>4435 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County </td>       <td>16411 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>7859 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin-Dublin City </td>       <td>16732 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin-Dun-Laoghaire-Rathdown </td>       <td>7196 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin &ndash;Fingal </td>       <td>11678 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin- South Dublin </td>       <td>9742 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>11428 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>5792 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>9731 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>4033 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>3540 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>1654 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>7920 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>1787 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>5164 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>4500 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>7976 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>4068 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>2979 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>2843 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>3687 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>7207 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>4723 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>3835 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>5994 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>4849 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Included in <i>First 5 </i>is a commitment to designing a new Funding Model to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality of early learning and care and school-age childcare. </p><p>In September 2019, my predecessor announced the establishment of an Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The group is considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. Since their first meeting in November 2019, the Expert Group has met fifteen times and they have made significant progress in their work.</p><p>To support the Expert Group's work, Frontier Economics was selected to deliver a significant programme of research to the Expert Group. Frontier Economics has delivered eight research papers to inform the Expert Group's work, covering international comparisons and funding approaches, staffing, affordability mechanisms, access and inclusion, quality, and collaboration.</p><p>The Expert Group is also undertaking consultation and engagement with stakeholders. Phase 1 of this consultation and engagement took place between August and December 2020, comprising a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars and focused discussions with providers, practitioners and parents. Phases 2 and 3 of consultation and engagement is ongoing, involving a series of facilitated events that bring together different perspectives to engage deeply in the conversation about how the various issues of affordability, sustainability, quality and inclusion interact and how the new Funding Model can best support these objectives.</p><p>Work also continues to progress on the development of a Workforce Development Plan (WDP) for the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector. The first phase of the WDP concluded in late 2020. A report on phase one of the WDP is being finalised before publication in the near future.</p><p>Phase two of the WDP, which began in February 2021, involves the preparation of detailed policy proposals to be prepared by five working groups during 2021. These working groups will submit final reports in July 2021 for consideration by the Steering and Stakeholder Groups of the Workforce Development Plan, before a final WDP report is published at the end of 2021.</p><p>It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations on the new Funding Model will be submitted to me in November 2021 for consideration before submission to wider Government. I anticipate that both the work of the Expert Group and Workforce Development Plan will contribute to informing the Budget 2022 process. <i>First 5</i>commits to at least doubling investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare by 2028 and the new Funding Model will be a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State.</p><p>Material relating to the Funding Model, including meeting papers, research papers, and reports, is available on a dedicated website,<i>www.first5fundingmodel.ie</i>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-05-12a.441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021051200080#WRJ05200"><p>I welcome the Report of the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office (OCO) &ldquo;Safety and Welfare of Children in Direct Provision&rdquo; and my Department accepts its recommendations in full.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department has embarked upon a series of actions, planned for the short to medium term which will build upon existing work to ensure the recommendations of the OCO will be implemented as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  IPAS and Tusla have committed to increased collaboration and coordination in the coming period.  IPAS will continue to work with Tusla during 2021 to develop interagency protocols and operating procedures that will support the sharing of case information between Tusla and IPAS and to track and monitor referrals and cases from beginning to end.</p>  <p>  A new Resident Welfare Team has recently been established within IPAS to case-manage individual families, and single residents, identified as having special reception needs and to ensure that those needs continue to be identified and addressed in the most appropriate way possible.  The Resident Welfare Team will be a multi-disciplinary team with experts from the fields of education, health and childcare seconded.   Additional resources have been sanctioned to support the work of this team and recruitment is underway.  </p>  <p>  All existing centres and all new centres are required to develop a child safeguarding statement.  IPAS will work with Tusla to ensure compliance with child safeguarding statements and Children First legislation.  An IPAS Audit of compliance will also take place this year in cooperation with Tusla.  IPAS will be ensuring that child safeguarding statements are translated and made available to all residents. Additional child safety training will also be rolled out to all centre managers as COVID restrictions allow.  </p>  <p>  I note the discrepancy in the figures mentioned in the report referenced by the Deputy.  The difference between the number of cases recorded by IPAS as referred to Tusla and the number of cases recorded by Tusla relating to children resident in IPAS accommodation between April 2017 and July 2020 arises because the Child and Family Services unit of IPAS is only notified of referrals that have originated from IPAS dedicated and temporary accommodation centres and from the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs) for Programme Refugees.   IPAS is not notified of individual referrals made to Tusla by schools, hospitals, sports clubs and members of the public as IPAS is not the designated authority to which such reports should be made.  Nor is it appropriate for IPAS officials or centre management to be party to details of such family matters where it has no legislative authority.</p>  <p>  Since the recent publication of the report, Tusla has committed to publishing its Direct Provision Policy for 2021 for all staff working with children and families living in Direct Provision accommodation. The Policy states that each Direct Provision accommodation centre will have a named point of contact within the relevant Tusla area. </p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla is reviewing its IT system to plan for the next stage of the development of the National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) and consideration will be given to enable referrals for children living in IPAS accommodation, along with other specified groups of children, to be tracked on a national basis.</p></reply>

The aim is to reduce the cost to the student by ensuring that there is a sufficient level of accommodation to meet future demand. The target as set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland </i>and the NSAS is the provision of 7,000 bed spaces by end 2019 and a total of 21,000 additional PBSA beds by 2024.  The 2019 target was surpassed, with 8,346 bed spaces completed by the end of the year. As of the end of 2020 more than 10,000 bed spaces have been completed.</p><p>However there has been a slowdown in construction in the student accommodation sector, as there has been throughout the construction industry, due to the impact of COVID-19. As Ireland continues to progress with the re-opening of the economy, it would be expected that the number of student accommodation projects being completed or moving on-site would once again increase. My Department will continue to carefully  monitor the situation in order to ensure a strong supply pipeline for student accommodation. As the Deputy is aware, my position is the current policy needs reflecting on and I am working with colleagues across Government on this.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Acts, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such common areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to annual service charges, it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis. Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC. </p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments. It provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an Order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act. The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation. The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p></reply>

A contract, once signed by both parties, binds the parties to the completion of the transaction. Disputes regarding contracts are a matter for the law and the courts.</p><p>&ldquo;Gazumping&rdquo; occurs where there has been an oral <i>pre-contract</i>agreement between a buyer and a seller, including the payment of an initial &ldquo;booking deposit&rdquo;, for the sale of property at a particular price and, subsequently, the seller<b></b>either: </p><p>- Refuses to execute a formal contract of sale to the buyer in question and sells to someone else for a higher price; or </p><p>- Refuses to execute a formal contract of sale to the buyer in question unless the buyer agrees to pay a higher price. </p><p>The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term &quot;subject to contract&quot;. </p><p>The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 &quot;Report on Gazumping&quot; (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, for example, to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs.  </p><p>There are no plans at present to introduce or amend legislation in this area. However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.</p><p>The Property Services Regulatory Authority, which was established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland&quot; which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts.

The increased travel restrictions, along with the mandatory hotel quarantine measures introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19, means that travel may not be possible and even if possible is not advisable unless absolutely essential. </p><p>When making such decisions, the Government considers the expert public health advices of NPHET to tackle the disease.

Preventing children getting involved in criminality, as well as diverting children away from it when they have already become involved, is a key priority for my Department. Both the Programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2021 contain a number of commitments with regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.  </p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at potential new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. A subgroup of this forum has already examined the issue of misuse of scramblers and quadbikes and this work has informed the development of a new scheme aimed at tackling this issue in local areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I also launched a new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 on 15 April. Youth crime, including anti-social behaviour, can have a major impact on our communities and poses significant challenges for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other Justice agencies. The factors which underlie youth crime have significant implications across a range of policy and service provisions, including Child and Family Services, Health, Education and local authority functions.   </p>  <p>  This new Strategy will respond collaboratively to the situation of vulnerable children and youngpeople, with a strong focus on diverting them away from offending, prevention and early intervention and family support, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.</p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been developing a new community safety policy to reflect the findings and recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The Commission found that community safety requires a whole of Government approach in partnership with local communities. This new policy will be given a statutory basis in a new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, the General Scheme of which was recently approved by Government. To support and inform the policy, three Local Community Safety Partnerships are being piloted in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Waterford and Longford and will run for the next two years.  The Partnerships will allow local communities to identify issues of particular concern within their area and work with the relevant State services to develop a local Community Safety Plan to specifically tackle these issues.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at this time to amend the Children (Amendment) Act 2021, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 or the Children (Amendment) Act 2015 in the manner referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made regarding Wicklow Courthouses and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on this matter.</p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027 includes a number of courthouse development projects, including for Wicklow Town. </p><p>The Courts Service advises that its highest priority at present is the Hammond Lane Family Law complex, for which they are currently finalising the business case, as required under the public spending code.  The five regional city and county town venues listed in the NDP including Wicklow are currently the next highest priorities for the Courts Service after Hammond Lane. </p><p>Specifically in relation to Wicklow, the Courts Service advises that a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (e.g. consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites, etc.) is envisaged as being required to meet current and future demand in Wicklow. This will require a building significantly larger than the existing two courtroom building. The Courts Service proposes to refurbish and extend the courthouse to provide the required accommodation and has acquired a number of adjoining properties that were in council ownership so as to have available a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged. </p><p>Facilitating works envisaged for the refurbishment and extension of Wicklow courthouse include the demolition of the 1940s extension/annex to the rear of the courthouse. In view of the fact that dry rot has spread extensively throughout the extension, the Courts Service proposes to bring this element of the facilitating works forward rather than incur the cost of treating the dry rot only to demolish the extension at a later date as part of the overall development. The Courts Service will need to go through the Part IX planning process in advance of this work. The Courts Service has been in contact with the Office of Public Works (OPW) about these works and it is intended that they will proceed subject to funding being available and the OPW's resource availability. However, at this time the Courts Service is not in a position to indicate when these demolition works will begin.</p><p>The former courthouse on Boghall Road in Bray has been vacant since 2006, when court sittings and services were relocated to alternative accommodation in the town centre. While the National Development Plan provides for the construction of county town type court facilities at various locations including Bray, the Boghall Road site is considered unsuitable in terms of both size and location. The Courts Service has no plans for this building at present and it is considered to be surplus to its requirements.  The Courts Service is willing to explore a transfer of the property to Wicklow County Council for alternative public use.  The Courts Service has been in contact with Wicklow County Council in this regard and the building has been inspected by engineers acting on behalf of the Council to determine its overall condition and to identify any concerns.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring adequate resources for the courts in order to maintain access to justice for all citizens. This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. </p></reply>

I understand that in certain instances, where an infant is born with a catastrophic injury, such as HIE &ndash; Hypoxic Ischaemic Encephalopathy &ndash; and the infant is subsequently eligible for a Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) payment by the Department of Social Protection, the infant is automatically eligible for a medical card which is issued by the HSE. The individual concerned retains this card irrespective of a change in means, once in receipt of a DCA payment.</p>  <p>  As part of the settlement negotiations between parties and the State Claims Agency, decisions on eligibility for a medical card are often dealt with on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>   The State Claims Agency has informed me that, where relevant, the Agency attempts, in catastrophic injury cases managed by it, to exclude from the special damages assessment those services which are already provided for in the medical card so that there is no double payment, thus allowing the child and his/her family to retain the medical card and the services it provides. In such circumstances, the State Claims Agency will formally notify the HSE that services which are already provided for in the medical card are not part of the settlement and should continue. </p>  <p>  The principle underlying the payment of damages in personal injury cases, such as those described above, is known as the restitutio in integrum principle which means putting the injured person, in so far as is possible, in the position he/she would have been but for the event giving rise to the injury.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances. The HSE conducts a financial assessment based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax; PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted. Certain expenses are also taken into account. </p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. This assessment process was introduced following the enactment of the Health Act 2008 which gave effect to Government decisions to end automatic entitlement to a medical card, irrespective of income, for people aged 70 years and over.  The new gross income arrangements provided for the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over to continue to hold medical cards under the new income thresholds. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were recently increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that persons aged 70 or older may also have their eligibility assessed under the general means tested medical card scheme in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.</p></reply>

The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its tenth meeting held on April 14th 2021 and with regular updates provided through a dedicated webpage on the Department of Health&rsquo;s website at gov.ie/en/campaigns/-Womens-Health/</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5 million &lsquo;Women&rsquo;s Health Fund&rsquo; to progress a programme of actions arising from the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This funding complements the additional significant investment delivered across women&rsquo;s health services in Budget 2021, including &euro;12 million investment in delivering the National Maternity Strategy and improving gynaecology and fertility services and &euro;10 million investment in Screening Services including Breast Check and Cervical Check.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce has listened to, engaged with and worked with more than 1,000 individuals, and organisations representing women and girls across the country. Based on this consultation, and review of the evidence, the Taskforce has developed proposals to improve supports for gynaecological health, engagement with physical activity, supports for menopause and mental health. In 2021, the &euro;5m Women&rsquo;s Health Fund will deliver a programme of actions arising from this work, along with, including improving mental health supports for women and girls. A national awareness and education campaign will also be delivered to provide a trusted source of information and help normalise discussions about women&rsquo;s health.</p>  <p>  Following confirmation of the fund, discussions with the Department and the HSE took place to identify activity under the proposals which could implemented in 2021 and funded through the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund. In April 2021, the first two areas to be funded under this fund were announced: </p>  <p>  - Two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services governed by two acute hospitals (Tallaght University Hospital, and University Maternity Hospital Limerick) </p>  <p>- Expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A number of further proposals are currently being finalised with stakeholders. Following final internal review and approval, further actions supported by the fund will be announced in the coming weeks. Alongside this activity, work is also underway on a longer-term approach to women&rsquo;s health.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  </p>  <p>  In recognition of the improving situation, the Government announced a roadmap on the 29 April for the gradual lifting of some restrictions over the next two months, with a particular focus on allowing more outdoor activities. A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.</p>  <p>  As part of these plans, in-person religious services can commence from 10th May, and the numbers attending funeral and wedding services can increase to 50. However, the public health advice remains that other religious ceremonies such as communions and confirmations should not take place at this time.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. NPHET advise that the current phased plan to reopening over the months of May and June can be considered low to medium risk. However, they also advise that a faster reopening involving a greater level of indoor mixing would be very high risk.</p>  <p>  While a child&rsquo;s First Communion or Confirmation is a very important milestone in their lives, the health and safety of the child, their family and the wider community is the main priority for Government. It is important to acknowledge the significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19 and this engagement will continue to form an important element of our response in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

A range of measures will be eased in May, with a further easing of measures in June subject to the epidemiological situation at the time. </p><p>The recent announcement included the following changes to the measures applying to weddings: as of May 10, there can be an increase in the number of guests attending wedding services to 50 which brings this figure in line with the numbers permitted at religious services.  </p><p>This increase to 50 guests relates to the service (both religious or civil) only. The number of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception should remain at 6 guests for indoor gatherings and 15 guests for outdoor gatherings. From 7 June, subject to the epidemiological situation at the time, it is envisaged that the numbers of guests attending a wedding celebration or reception will increase to 25. The Government has indicated that a further range of activities, including numbers attending indoor and outdoor events, will be considered at the end of June. Information in relation to the Government announcement is available here: <i></i></p><p>In line with the roadmap announced by the Government to gradually lift restrictions, F&aacute;ilte Ireland are in the process of updating their operational guidelines and these guidelines will be available online:<i> </i></p><p>It is important to note that while there is now scope to ease a range of public health measures, this approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensuring the protection of the gains of recent months, the protection of those most vulnerable, and the protection of health and social care, education, and childcare services. </p><p>Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to continue to avoid the virus spreading and to support the safe reopening of activities over the coming months.</p></reply>

An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out their will and preferences in relation to treatment decisions that may arise in the future, when they no longer have capacity. </p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to commencing these provisions as soon as possible, and work has been underway to develop a code of practice to accompany the AHD provisions.  The AHD Multidisciplinary Working Group has developed a draft code of practice which has been submitted to the Decision Support Service and which will be submitted to me, for approval,  once finalised.  </p>  <p>  The establishment of a Register for Advance Healthcare Directives is a complex undertaking.  My Department recognises that for this to be both operable and meaningful, the further deployment of health identifiers across the wider health system will be required. We will consider making such Regulations when national Health Identifiers are deployed across the health system. </p>  <p>  However, while Part 8 of the Act of 2015 allows for regulations for the Register of Advance Healthcare Directives, it should be noted that it does not require that this Register is established before the Act is commenced. </p>  <p>  There are a number of other interdependencies which must be addressed before Part 8 can be commenced and work is continuing in respect of all outstanding matters.  These also include commencing certain other provisions of the Act outside of Part 8 that fall under the remit of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

In accordance with Regulation 34 of S.I. No. 415/2013 - Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure. The registered provider is required to make each resident and their family aware of the complaints procedure as soon as is practicable following admission.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has engaged with the nursing homes' established complaint&rsquo;s procedure.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also wish to raise their concerns with the Chief Inspector for Social Services in HIQA.   As the independent regulator of nursing homes, the Chief Inspector has no formal legal role in examining individual complaints, however, they do take into account all information received, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections.  If a concern is raised about a nursing home, the Chief Inspector reviews all information received to inform its on-going risk-based regulation activities.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on consultation with families I would like to advise that under the Care and Welfare Regulations the person in charge is required to prepare a care plan for a resident. This should be formally reviewed, at intervals not exceeding 4 months, and where necessary, revised after consultation with the resident concerned and where appropriate that resident&rsquo;s family. In addition Regulation 23 requires that there is an annual review of the quality and safety of care delivered to residents in the designated centre and that this is prepared in consultation with residents and their families.</p>  <p>  Regulation 25 (4) provides that a discharge shall be discussed, planned for and agreed with a resident and, where appropriate, with their family or carer, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract agreed in accordance with Regulation 24.</p>  <p>  Regulation 13 (1) provides that where a resident is approaching the end of his or her life, the person in charge shall ensure that where the resident indicates a preference as to his or her location (for example a preference to return home or for a private room), such preference shall be facilitated in so far as is reasonably practicable.</p>  <p>   A registered provider shall also, in so far as is reasonably practical, ensure that a resident has access to independent advocacy services.</p></reply>

Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) funding has been leveraged by the Commission to facilitate its negotiations with vaccine manufacturers, including with regard to production costs and securing a reduced per dose cost for Member States.</p>  <p>  This process has provided Ireland with access to vaccines (at a reduced cost) that it would find it difficult to access otherwise within a year after the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. Four of the vaccines in the EU portfolio have already been awarded Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) by the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports efforts made by the Commission to safeguard the production and delivery of doses of vaccine in the quantities agreed with vaccine suppliers and to ensure that up-front funding provided through ESI has been properly used.</p>  <p>  Covid 19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. No vaccine will be used until Market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  The delivery of vaccines under APAs that the Commission has negotiated on behalf of Member States are predicated upon a CMA being obtained from the Commission (on the basis of a positive recommendation being awarded by the EMA).</p>  <p>  The awarding of a CMA provides a high level of assurance that a vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has met the requirements of the independent regulatory process as regards demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy.</p>  <p>  The Sinopharm vaccine has not been awarded a CMA to date.</p></reply>

The PWG is working hard on behalf of the sector and has been very pro-active in engaging with my Department on this matter. </p>  <p>  I fully understand the sector&rsquo;s aim to seek mitigation, in so far as is possible, of the disease risks that their members face.

The Department has made available, at no cost to the poultry producer,  biosecurity risk assessments, which are delivered by Animal Health Ireland trained veterinary practitioners, for commercial broiler and layer units.  The set of recommendations provided guides the producer on how to improve the standard of biosecurity on the farm and reduce the likelihood of disease incursion. &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo; is a cornerstone of Animal Health Policy.</p>  <p>  The Department has also expressed its support in principle for the establishment of a health programme for the poultry sector operated by Animal Health Ireland;  this would operate in partnership with the poultry sector, and has excellent potential to  improve the overall health of the national flock, as well as the standard of biosecurity on farms, thus reducing the risk of disease outbreaks.</p></reply>

It is useful to note that farmers may hold more than one set of payment entitlements, each of which may fall into separate intervals as specified in the question. Therefore, this table shows the numbers of sets of entitlements under each interval. This data is as of 10th May 2021 but will not remain static as the payment entitlement sets evolve due to ongoing transfers of payment entitlements between farmers.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Range of Payment Entitlement Sets Unit Values </th>       <th>Number of Sets of Payment Entitlements</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;&euro;100</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;100 - &euro;200</td>       <td>123,709 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;200 - &euro;300</td>       <td>45,142 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;300 - &euro;400</td>       <td>6,113 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; &euro;400</td>       <td>1,919 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The total number of sets of payment entitlements (<i>n</i>=176,883) is greater than the total number of farmers holding payment entitlements; as mentioned above this is due to the fact that farmers can have a number of sets of payment entitlements of varying values. To classify the data by farmer would require the payment entitlement unit values to be averaged and thus would skew the data. It is for this reason that the data cannot be mapped to stocking density as it would provide an imprecise representation. </p><p>All payment entitlements held under the BPS were subject to convergence. Convergence is a mandatory provision in the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programme to redistribute funds between farmers. Over the period 2015-2019, those with higher value payment entitlements saw a reduction in their values while those with payment entitlements that had a value of less than 90% of the average value saw an increase. In 2019, all payment entitlement values reached a minimum of 60% of the national average.</p><p>The new legislative proposals for the CAP are ongoing with final agreement on convergence depending on the outcome of the trilogue process. Current indications are that the convergence of payment entitlements will continue under the new CAP. </p><p>The Department will continue to examine all the options presented during the negotiations in order to achieve the best possible outcome for Irish farmers.</p></reply>

Research suggests that there is potential for a significant role for biogas / bio-methane in the decarbonisation of the heat and transport sectors with corresponding climate benefits. </p>  <p>  Supports for anaerobic digestion heating systems are currently available under the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH). The SSRH supports the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users. The Scheme, which is funded by the Department of Environment, Climate Action and Communications (DECC)  and operated by the SEAI, supports the adoption of heating systems that use solid biomass fuels and heating systems that produce and use biogas via anaerobic digestion. </p>  <p>  Biogas produced via anaerobic digestion can be upgraded and injected into the gas grid - at which point it is classified as biomethane. Ireland's National Energy &amp;amp; Climate Plan has set an indicative target of 1.6TWh of indigenous biomethane to be injected annually into the gas grid by 2030.  </p>  <p>  The plan also set out a number of measures that could support the development of biomethane including the potential for a new renewable energy obligation in the heat sector. The recently updated actions under the Climate Action Plan include a specific action to consider such a measure and publish a decision by the end of this year on whether an obligation should be introduced along with the planned timeframe and scope. DECC is working to deliver this action by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department supports research, development and demonstration in this particular area and has funded two projects through the European Innovation Partnerships Initiative (EIP) under the Rural Development Programme 2014- 2020. The Biorefinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green biorefineries) and Irish Bioenergy Association (IrBEA) small biogas demonstration programme have been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to work closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), which is the lead Department in this area, to ensure that the supply of domestic fuels available in the forest and agriculture sectors are mobilised to support energy generation from a range of bioenergy technologies including Anaerobic Digestion.</p></reply>

In order to continue to progress, it is necessary to have accurate data to understand the pattern of pesticide use in Ireland, and to ensure that measures based on robust scientific information are available to farmers to help them to further reduce use of pesticides where possible.</p>  <p>  A number of measures are in place to review pesticide use across the agriculture sector. These include collection and analysis of pesticides sales data on an annual basis, a rolling programme of pesticide usage surveys, covering all main crops, and calculation of Harmonised Risk Indicators for assessing trends in risk from pesticide use. These indicators (HRI 1 and HRI 2) are specified under the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive. Further developments to improve the collection and use of pesticide statistics, including additional risk indicators, will occur as part of the implementation of the EU Farm to Fork Strategy.</p>  <p>  Regarding measures to help farmers reduce use of pesticides, the key approach is full implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) by all farmers. Under this approach all alternatives to pesticides must be considered and pesticides should only be used where essential. Teagasc provides extensive advisory supports to farmers to help them implement IPM practices and also carries out a significant body of research work to ensure that advice is based on up-to-date and reliable information. It should be noted that the Department has provided funding for a number of IPM-related research projects.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides various financial supports to farmers. Examples include payments for low-input grassland, and funding under the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) for equipment to reduce pesticide use, such as heavy rollers. </p>  <p>  The measures outlined above, together with implementation and enforcement of the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive, are contributing to more sustainable use of pesticides in Ireland. The possibility for further measures will be considered as part of ongoing EU discussions on implementing the Farm to Fork Strategy.</p></reply>

The CFP provides the framework for the long-term conservation and sustainable management of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of fishing in Ireland's 200 miles zone and throughout EU waters.  </p>  <p>  Technical measures are used to support sustainable fishing.  Technical measures are rules on how, where and when fishers may fish and also include gear, catch composition and ways to deal with accidental catches.  A revised and updated EU Regulation on conservation though technical measures was adopted by Council and Parliament on 20 June 2019 (EU Regulation 2019/1241).  This Regulation sets the baseline standards for each sea basin.</p>  <p>  The measures may include specifications for design and use of fishing gears including minimum mesh size for particular fisheries, more selective gears to avoid and reduce unwanted catches including juvenile fish, areas closed for restricted fishing seasons and minimum conservation and landing sizes for fish.   </p>  <p>  EU Member States  with a fisheries interest in a given sea basin can agree on regional technical measures, adapted to the specific regional circumstances. Such measures can then be adopted as EU secondary legislation, if confirmed by scientists to be consistent with the objectives of the common fisheries policy.  Ireland works with Member States in the North West Waters region and are advised by  stakeholders through the North West Waters Advisory Council and Pelagic Advisory Council to agree appropriate technical measures for the fisheries in which we participate.    </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) to bring forward proposals at EU level for technical measures for the fisheries in which we operate that result in increased selectivity and provide increased protection to overfished and sensitive stocks.  In that regard, a range of technical measures for the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and the North West area have been developed over recent years.  BIM,  working with the fishing industry, has developed and trialled many of these measures which have been designed to protect vulnerable stocks such as cod and whiting.  For 2021, these measures have been included in Council Regulation 2021/92 - the TAC and quota Regulation.  It is planned that these measures and any additional measures agreed through the regional procedures, will be given effect through an EU delegated act in accordance with Article 15(2) of Regulation 2019/1241 in recognition of the need to apply them on a stable basis.  </p>  <p>  BIM is continuing to work closely with the fishing industry to develop modification to  fishing gears to increase further selectivity and to further avoid juvenile fish or vulnerable species.  In addition BIM is carrying out trials on new gear options to  also improve fuel efficiency and help reduce carbon emissions.  I am pleased that the commitment of industry,  working with BIM to develop improved fishing practices that will strengthen sustainability and conservation of fish  stocks, is delivering positive outcomes. </p></reply>
