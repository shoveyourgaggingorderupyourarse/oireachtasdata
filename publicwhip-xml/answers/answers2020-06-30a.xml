Any expenditure incurred by the Commission enables it to progress its investigation and pay for the day to day costs arising.  In addition to the Commission&rsquo;s staff and the legal counsel it has engaged, the Commission has also incurred costs which have been paid to a broad range of suppliers who provide goods or services to the Commission for a range of functions such as IT, office equipment, electricity, office cleaning, etc. </p><p>The Commission has estimated that the final cost of the completion of the first module of its investigation, regarding the Siteserv transaction, will be from &euro;11 - &euro;14 million.  However, this estimate assumes the investigation is completed in accordance with the timetable stated by the Commission and excludes costs or delays associated with judicial review hearings.  The Commission also acknowledges that it involves a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs actually recoverable by parties before the Commission, and it assumes the Commission&rsquo;s Legal Costs Guidelines are not successfully challenged.  The Department of the Taoiseach has given its view on many occasions, including in briefings with Oireachtas representatives, that the final cost is likely to significantly exceed the Commission&rsquo;s estimate, and could exceed &euro;30m.</p></reply>

In light of this, Government decided to exempt places of worship from the regulations restricting numbers on mass gatherings. The exemption applies to places of worship only and not to any gatherings that may take place after the religious ceremony such as wedding receptions.</p><p>Work is ongoing on new <i>COVID-19 Guidance for Religious Services </i>by the HSE/Health Protection Surveillance Centre. This will require plans to be developed for managing attendance at each premises, including an assessment to determine how many people can attend services within the requirements of social distancing.</p></reply>

The Report was accepted in full by the Government at that time and, to facilitate implementation, an extensive High Level Plan titled &quot;&quot;Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date. </p><p>The High Level Plan provides for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the PSPC recommendations. It also proposes a timeframe for actions or projects to commence and identifies the lead actor to implement the action or project. The timeframe for commencement of actions is split into four distinct timelines i.e. immediate, short-term, medium-term and long-term. The Plan defines long-term as &quot;action to commence within 6-12 months of approval of this Plan&quot;.  As such, it should be noted that there is no deadline of 4 July 2020 for the complete implementation of the long-terms projects set out in the Plan.  </p><p>The table below outlines the status of the projects due for long-term implementation as outlined in the plan and the current status of each project. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Project</th>       <th>Current Status</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>V1</td>       <td>Review of Pay Structures </td>       <td>Some initial preliminary work has commenced within my Department.  The main body of work is to be done as part of a wider review of public sector pay arrangements.  The timeframe for this wider review not confirmed at present.  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>R6</td>       <td>Professional Military Education (PME) Strategy  </td>       <td>First draft of the PME Strategy is nearing completion.

I am particularly concerned regarding the humanitarian needs of the population, which are acute. Due to the severe lack of access to basic goods, services, medicines and medical equipment, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the country is extremely worrying.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the call for international solidarity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. I fully support the calls by the UN Secretary-General and by the EU High Representative Josep Borrell for sanctions regimes to be applied in such a way as not to hinder the provision of essential equipment and supplies to fight COVID-19 and limit its spread. It is important that humanitarian exemptions provided for under UN and EU sanctions regimes are fully availed of and applied in an appropriate and timely manner in light of the current emergency. Through the use of these exemptions, Ireland, as an EU Member State, will play its part to ensure that sanctions do not impede efforts in the global response to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  We also join the UNSG in urging countries with unilateral sanctions regimes to ensure that these sanctions do not in any way hinder the fight against COVID-19 or impede humanitarian assistance from reaching the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  At this time of global crisis, I believe that a strong multilateral response is essential. In order to contain and fight the virus, nations must work together and enhance international cooperation. For this reason, Ireland is encouraging a UN system-wide response, and we have significantly increased our financial support by quadrupling funding to the World Health Organisation for 2020. We have allocated over &euro;115 million to the global COVID-19 response, and have pledged an additional &euro;18 million in support to GAVI for the 2021-25 period. Ireland is also proud to contribute to the European Union&rsquo;s global response to COVID-19, which has mobilised almost &euro;36 billion to date.</p>  <p>  I was pleased that Ireland participated in the International Donors Conference in solidarity with Venezuelan migrants and refugees in the midst of COVID-19 that took place on 26 May, co-hosted by Spain and the EU and convened in collaboration with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Ireland pledged &euro;1 million in 2020 to the UNHCR and IOM Regional Response Plan for Venezuelan migrants and refugees.</p>  <p>  As I said in my statement that I issued on the occasion of the Solidarity Conference, it is more important than ever for us to demonstrate the values of solidarity and our shared humanity. We know that the impact of this crisis will not fall equally, but will disproportionately impact those already suffering from humanitarian crises, including in situations of displacement, conflict or natural disaster. </p>  <p>  Regarding the correspondence which the Deputy mentions, this was received by my Department, along with subsequent other linked correspondence, regarding the situation in Venezuela, and a composite reply issued on 9 June. </p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor the situation in the country closely and engage with my EU colleagues and other key interlocutors on this important issue.  </p></reply>

The principles of equality and non-discrimination are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is important that these principles are protected and promoted throughout the Union. </p>  <p>  Advancing human rights is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, The Global Island.  Ireland is committed to promoting the rights of LGBTI+ persons who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination around the world.  Ireland continues to support initiatives in international fora which promote and protect the rights of LGBTI+ persons, and which condemn violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Poland also undertakes a number of initiatives to this end to raise awareness of and facilitate discussion on the rights of LGBTI+ individuals. This includes taking part in the Warsaw Equality Parade each year.  The Embassy also works collaboratively with different NGOs in Poland to facilitate discussion around the issues facing LGBTI+ communities. </p>  <p>  We will continue to work both bilaterally and at the EU level to promote and protect the rights of LGBTI+ communities across the EU and beyond.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.58.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000055#WRB03400"><p>I have been forthright on my views about Israeli Government statements regarding the possible annexation of territory in the West Bank.  The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would be a clear violation of international law. It would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland, or by the international community more generally. </p>  <p>  Ireland will not give up on the Two State solution as long as that is the objective of the parties themselves, but annexation would without doubt threaten that prospect, and seriously undermine efforts to find a negotiated solution that respects the legitimate positions of both parties. </p>  <p>  As I stated publicly on 23 April: "I think it important, as a friend and partner of Israel, to be very clear about the gravity of any such step. Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter, whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe&rsquo;s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of States and the rule of law in the modern world. No one State can set it aside at will." </p>  <p>  I have in the past made my views on this clear to Israeli leaders, including during my most recent visit to Israel in December 2019, and my officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities. I have also raised this issue in discussions with US representatives, and underlined my serious concerns about possible annexation.</p>  <p>  I, and senior officials in my Department, have also highlighted the issue with a large number of EU Member States, to encourage a clear and united position. When this was discussed at the 15 May video conference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, there was broad agreement that the EU and its Member States should convey these concerns directly to the new Israeli Government. That outreach is ongoing. I welcome the very clear statements that have been made on this matter by EU High Representative / Vice President Josep Borrell, who has said that any annexation could not pass unchallenged. Annexation would inevitably have negative consequences for the EU-Israel relationship.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also taken opportunities to raise this issue at the UN, including in Ireland&rsquo;s statements to the UN Security Council on 23 April 2020, and the Human Rights Council on 15 June 2020. Ireland will continue to prioritise the Middle East Peace Process as we prepare to take up our seat on the UN Security Council in January 2021.</p></reply>

No two conflicts are the same and each needs to be approached with an understanding of root causes and contributory factors.</p>  <p>  In line with the mandate of the Security Council as the principal organ charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, I would highlight three overarching principles that will guide our approach to the Council's work. </p>  <p>  The first is building peace, including championing the UN's role in peacekeeping, reinforcing the link between peacekeeping and peace-building, and further developing cooperation on peace and security between the UN and regional organisations, including the African Union. We need to ensure that peace is inclusive and fully involves civil society, particularly women and young people.</p>  <p>  The second is preventing conflict. This means strengthening the full spectrum of the UN&rsquo;s conflict prevention activities &ndash; including preventative diplomacy, mediation and non-proliferation and disarmament - and addressing the structural drivers of conflict and insecurity, particularly climate change. </p>  <p>  The third is ensuring accountability. This means upholding the rule of law, in particular international humanitarian and human rights law, prioritising the protection of civilians in conflict, ensuring humanitarian access and fighting against impunity. </p>  <p>  Ireland aims to be an effective and impactful Member of the Council at a time when multilateralism is under grave pressure. Our work on peace and security issues on the Council will be fully integrated with our ongoing work on other foreign policy priorities, notably sustainable development and human rights.</p>  <p>  During our campaign, we consulted widely with UN Member States to understand the views of the international community on key issues on the Security Council agenda. We will listen to the views of all parties before taking a position at the Council. We ran an inclusive campaign and we intend our Membership of the Council to be equally inclusive.</p></reply>

However, as noted already this is not a matter that I can adjudicate on.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that if a consumer has a complaint with the service of their insurance provider, it is advisable that that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  This includes if they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law. The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p><p>In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme necessarily had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system.  The key conditions of the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that &ndash;</p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before, in general, 15 March 2020, but extended recently to 1 April 2020.</p><p>The latter two conditions were particularly designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  The wage subsidy per employee is calculated based on the net pay reported for January and February 2020. It follows that the TWSS can only operate in respect of an employee, whether full-time or part-time, who was on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after that date, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, he or she does not meet the eligibility criteria with the employer as he or she would not have been on the employer&rsquo;s payroll at that date. There are no plans at the present moment to revisit the core criteria. </p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the Government decided on 5 June 2020 to extend the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) until the end of August.The intention is to continue to monitor the scheme closely in the coming period.</p><p>The new Programme for Government contains a commitment that a July Jobs Initiative will be brought forward which will, among other things, &quot;set out a pathway for the future implementation of the Temporary Wage Subsidy&quot;.  The matter raised by the Deputies will be one of the many factors that will be taken into account as part of that exercise.</p><p>In relation to other direct support measures, I would draw the Deputies' attention to a recent publication by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which outlines the key financial supports and resources that are being made available to help all businesses and sectors impacted by Covid-19. This publication is available at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.85.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000055#WRB06100"><p>As the Minister for Finance is Ireland&rsquo;s Governor to the IMF, I propose to respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s question as far as it relates to the Fund. I presume that the Deputy is referring to the 2012 set of UN Guiding Principles on Foreign Debt and Human Rights, endorsed by resolution (A/HRC/RES/20/10) obliging governments (lenders and borrowers) to ensure the primacy of human rights when they make lending and borrowing decisions.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity that the Deputy&rsquo;s question affords me to clarify the richness of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with International Financial Institutions. While the role of the IMF is probably most often perceived through a fiscal and monetary lens that is accordingly associated with economic policy, our international development policy is also an important driver and compass in our engagement with the Institution. Our current whole-of-Government international development strategy, A Better World, is grounded and informed by the overarching principles in the UN&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Echoing the priorities articulated in our international development strategy, Ireland&rsquo;s IMF engagement advocates the promotion and protection of human rights and prioritises gender equality.</p>  <p>  Of course, the IMF's primary mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. It focuses on achieving sustainable growth and a stable macroeconomic environment, which in themselves are supportive of human rights, while encouraging member Governments and other Agencies to work together towards designing development strategies that take human rights into account. Broadly speaking, many of the Fund&rsquo;s activities &ndash; reducing macroeconomic imbalances and structural bottlenecks; eliminating obstacles to international payments; and preventing financial crises - contribute directly or indirectly to reducing poverty and fostering human rights. However, the IMF recognises that while growth, macroeconomic stability, and a well-functioning international monetary system can contribute to an environment that supports poverty reduction, they cannot, by themselves, eliminate poverty or protect human rights.</p>  <p>  The Fund has also acknowledged that it must be aware of any adverse effects of the corrective policy actions required as part of individual IMF programmes. Although the costs of adjustment are inevitable with any programme of financial support, the IMF insists that they need not to fall disproportionately on the poor nor compromise human rights. In some cases, the Fund encourages Governments to introduce appropriate social protection measures to help alleviate adverse social consequences during periods of adjustment. With regard to gender specifically, the IMF has increasingly recognised this as a macro-critical issue, noting that reducing gender gaps can have important economic benefits. Gender informs the Fund&rsquo;s country work both in terms of surveillance and the structural reform commitments required by IMF-supported programmes which aim to promote gender equality. Gender issues are also an integral part of capacity development through technical assistance and training.</p>  <p>  The IMF has a system of checks and balances to ensure accountability, ranging from internal and external audits, risk management, and evaluations of its policies and operations. The Fund is also accountable to all 189 member countries through the Board of Governors and the Board of Executive Directors on which all members are represented. The IMF recognises the benefits of a transparent and wide engagement with civil society groups to gather broader perspectives about the impact of the Fund&rsquo;s work and improve policy advice and analysis and has worked to increase dialogue with CSOs. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to assure the Deputy that a commitment to human rights shall remain central to Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with the IMF.  </p></reply>

I presume that the Recommendations that Deputy Shortall is referring to are those contained in the &ldquo;Unhealthy conditions: IMF loan conditionality and its impact on health financing&rdquo; report published by Eurodad (the European Network on Debt and Development), which is a network of 50 civil society organisations (CSOs) from 20 European countries. This report outlined an interesting analysis of the impact of certain loan conditionality with a particular focus on health financing. It is timely that the Deputy raises this Report given the imperative for significantly ramping up the requirement for global healthcare financing against a backdrop of severe economic pressures.</p>  <p>   As a recent graduate of a thankfully successful IMF programme ourselves, I can assure the Deputy we are very conscious of the perils of counter-productive conditionality attendant to sovereign financing.  However, the objective of conditionality is not to penalise those who access IMF financing but rather to create conditions of sustainability and resilience. As I have recently noted, Ireland's reforms and reorientation after the financial crisis has left us in a far better position to deal with the range of impacts of the current pandemic crisis.</p>  <p>  The IMF's primary mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. This is achieved via:</p>  <p>  - Surveillance - monitoring member country policies as well as national, regional, and global economic and financial developments;</p>  <p>  - Policy advice - promoting policies designed to foster economic stability, reduce vulnerability to economic and financial crises, and raise living standards;</p>  <p>  - Capacity development - providing technical assistance and training to help member countries build better economic institutions; and</p>  <p>  - Financial assistance - providing loans to member countries that are experiencing actual or potential balance-of-payments problems.</p>  <p>  IMF financial assistance is usually provided within the context of individual country adjustment programmes which include a set of corrective policy actions designed to overcome the problems that led the country to seek financial aid. These policy adjustments are an integral part of IMF lending and essential in order to restore sound financial and economic fundamentals and build resilience, thereby avoiding repeated crises and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Fund&rsquo;s members. Commitments to undertake certain policy actions as part of an IMF-supported programme are formulated and agreed in close collaboration with the requesting country&rsquo;s Government. The over-arching goal is always to restore or maintain balance-of-payments viability and macroeconomic stability without resorting to measures that are destructive or harmful to national or international prosperity. These measures are also required to safeguard IMF resources by ensuring that the country&rsquo;s balance of payments will be strong enough to permit it to repay the loan so that these funds can be made available to other member countries in need.</p>  <p>  The conditionality of IMF programmes is broadly assessed by the Fund&rsquo;s Executive Board and staff in periodic Reviews of Program Design and Conditionality. The most recent Review in 2018 examined the performance of Fund-supported programmes ongoing between September 2011 and end-2017 and concluded that conditionality was generally well-tailored to country needs and programme objectives. However, the Fund did acknowledge the need for IMF-supported programmes to work in concert with national reform plans; to improve two-way communication with the broader public to support buy-in; and to take institutional and political capacity to deliver programme objectives on a realistic timetable into consideration.</p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the financial assistance provided by the IMF is flexible and responsive. This has been aptly demonstrated over the last few months in the Fund&rsquo;s rapid and comprehensive response to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. The IMF has played a significant role in providing vital emergency assistance to help members to deal with the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, over 100 of the Fund&rsquo;s 189 members have requested emergency assistance. Of these, 70 requests for emergency financing have been approved for a total of US$ 24.4 billion. Much of this assistance was delivered through emergency financing instruments which focus on providing a fast-disbursement and limited-conditionality emergency response </p>  <p>  Indeed, the Deputy will note that the increased use of these flexible instruments with low conditionality is in line with the thrust of the Eurodad Recommendation.</p></reply>

Where this date is between 1 September and 31 December, CAT is payable by 31 October in the following year.</p><p>Section 30 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 contains the rules for determining the valuation date. The valuation date depends on the circumstances particular to a case and is not a fixed date in relation to all gifts and inheritances. In the case of a gift, the valuation date is generally the date on which the property is given to a beneficiary. In the case of an inheritance, however, it can be earlier as it is the date on which the executors of the will become entitled to retain the property for the benefit of a beneficiary. Generally, this is the date on which probate or administration is granted.</p><p>Where the benefit consists of property, it may well be the case that CAT is payable before a beneficiary has received the property due to a delay in completing the administration of an estate. Equally, where a beneficiary has actually received the property, CAT may be payable before a beneficiary has had the opportunity to sell that property and pay the tax liability. Outside of the current COVID-19 circumstances, the length of the conveyancing process is such that it is often the case that a CAT liability arises before a property can be sold to pay that liability. To provide for such situations, taxpayers have a statutory entitlement to payment by instalments in certain circumstances.  Monthly instalment payments for up to five years may be allowed subject to the payment of interest at an annual rate of 8%. However, Revenue has discretion to allow payment of CAT by instalments over a longer period in exceptional circumstances where the tax cannot be paid without excessive hardship. </p><p>In such circumstances, Revenue also has discretion to allow payment to be postponed for such period and on such terms (including the waiver of interest) as it thinks fit. Revenue will consider each case on its merits, taking into account both the financial circumstances of the beneficiary and the nature of the gift or inheritance involved.</p></reply>

While the legislation imposes the levy on the insurance company, the general practice with insurance premiums is for the insurer to pass the charge on to the policy holder/investor. There are no exemptions available in relation to any of the policies (or investment products) covered by the charge. The current stamp duty legislation does not provide for any account to be taken of the exemption given in relation to other types of taxes and charges.   </p>  <p>  The 1% levy applies to all premiums paid to an insurance company.  If a policy holder cancels an existing policy and invests in a new policy with a different insurance company, this second company would also be liable to pay the 1% levy on the amount of the premium paid and would probably pass the charge on to the policy holder. The stamp duty legislation does not provide for any account to be taken of a previous 1% charge paid to a different insurer. </p></reply>

Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed quickly, having regard to the objective of getting financial assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>  <p>  The key eligibility criterion for the TWSS requires that the employer must make a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, there will be a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully, but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.  In the case of the public sector this criterion is not met. Thus, the TWSS is not available to employers in the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector.</p>  <p>  It is noted that the person who is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question applied to her employer to resume work, while she was on a period of approved special leave without pay following maternity leave.

The relief is scheduled to end on 31 July 2020 but there is provision for an extension if this is required following a review and consultation with Member States.</p>  <p>  Following a request from my Department, Revenue has also implemented, on an administrative basis, the application of the zero rate of VAT to the domestic supply of personal protection equipment, ventilators, thermometers, hand sanitisers and oxygen as necessary to combat COVID-19 when supplied to hospitals, nursing homes, GP practices and the like, for use in the delivery of COVID-19 related health care services to their patients.  This concessionary treatment will apply until 31 July, subject to review.  The scope of the relief corresponds with the relief on the importation of these goods by the bodies specified in the Commission Decision.  </p>  <p>  Any further extension of zero rating to cover supplies of medical equipment and/or personal protection equipment to dentists and other sectors and businesses would require a change in legislation at EU level; the VAT Directive would not permit a legislative measure for the application of the zero rate of VAT to such supplies and there are no grounds in the Commission Decision that would support the adoption of such a measure, even on a temporary basis. </p>  <p>  It remains the case that businesses which are registered for VAT and incur VAT in relation to goods which will be used for the purposes of the taxable business are entitled to reclaim the VAT incurred through their VAT return. </p></reply>

The Payments under TWSS are also subject to USC while Pandemic Unemployment Payments follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and are exempt from that charge.  Amounts paid under both schemes are exempt from PRSI charges in the case of employees.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the person in question initially received PUP payments in April 2020 and transferred to TWSS payments in May 2020. Neither of the schemes is being taxed in real-time through the PAYE system and the person may become liable for tax and USC (for TWSS) at the end of the year. Any liabilities due will be calculated by Revenue through the PAYE End of Year Review process. </p>  <p>  The level of tax and USC due by the person may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him at the end of the year. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of the TWSS and the PUP, including the person in question, on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year. This &lsquo;preserves&rsquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any tax or USC liabilities that arise for 2020. </p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with the person to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period.

The Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland has published a Covid-19 Support FAQ which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of Covid-19 on their mortgage application.</p>  <p>  Within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit, or temporarily suspend a mortgage approval in principle, is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not possible for me or the Central Bank to instruct lenders in that regard.  Also, a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown and, in such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is a commercial and contractual matter for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p></reply>

Therefore, Insurance Ireland advises that consumers review the finance documentation they received when they purchased the finance for the car with a view to understanding if they were offered GAP cover and if the potential risks associated with same was explained to them at the time of purchasing the finance.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, it is worth recalling that the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code was introduced in 2006 and revised in 2012.  It requires firms to act honestly fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers, and to act with due care and diligence.  The Code contains specific requirements in respect of the handing of claims, such as requiring firms to have certain procedures in place as well as requirements around the provision of information to consumers on claims.  While the Central Bank of Ireland does not adjudicate on individual consumer complaints, the Code sets out how a regulated entity must engage with a consumer on complaints, which includes complaints around the handing of insurance claims.</p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the actions of an insurance provider in terms of the settlement of a claim, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  </p>  <p>  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes, which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider.  The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-5677000.  Investigations by the FSPO are free of charge to the complainant.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland also operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. </p></reply>

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is one of the main tools with which we are protecting the income of employees who otherwise would not be working and it is hoped that it will be a major boost in saving the businesses for which they work. As of 18 June 551,800 employees have received a subsidy since the start of the Scheme, 232,400 employees received a subsidy in the previous week and an estimated 410,000 employees were being supported by the Scheme having received a subsidy in their most recent pay period. </p>  <p>  Whilst I completely acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders. </p>  <p>  The banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore as Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  In relation to AIB, officials in the Department received the following advice from AIB Group: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;AIB is actively engaging with all customers who have applied for a mortgage with the bank.  We are closely monitoring the impact of Covid-19 on our customers. AIB is required to complete a responsible and prudent assessment of all applications from the borrower&rsquo;s and the lender&rsquo;s perspective. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Existing mortgage approvals (Approval in Principle &ndash; AIPs) are unaffected by Covid-19 (amount/rate/term etc.). </p>  <p>  &ldquo;When customers wish to progress to the loan offer stage, we are obliged to understand their current financial circumstances, as our primary concern is to do what is right for our customers, in the short and long term".  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Where a customer has been adversely impacted by Covid-19, and there are concerns about their longer term income to service the mortgage, it may not be in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to proceed with the application at this time. The bank will engage with those customers individually over the coming months and deal with each one on a case by case basis.&rdquo; </p></reply>

The overarching ambition of the scheme is to ensure the key relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed.</p>  <p>  In the context of the compelling need for immediate implementation of the TWSS, the scheme had to build on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system for January and February 2020. The key eligibility criteria for the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that -</p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the  employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020, which was recently extended, by concession, to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020. </p>  <p>  The latter two criteria were particularly designed to prevent abuse and exploitation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Under PAYE legislation employers who qualify to pay their PAYE/PRSI/USC liabilities to Revenue on a quarterly basis, but operate their payroll on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, must file payroll submissions with Revenue each time they pay their staff. This payroll data is the key requirement without which the TWSS cannot operate and it is not possible to provide access to the system where employers have not met these statutory filing requirements. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the difficulties encountered by the business in question in accessing the TWSS arose because it failed to file payroll submissions for January and February through the real-time PAYE system. The fact that the business is facilitated with a quarterly payment arrangement for its PAYE liabilities does not remove the requirement to file payroll submissions with Revenue each time it pays wages. The consequence of not filing the January and February payroll submissions is that the TWSS system cannot calculate a subsidy payment for the business in respect of its employee because the required data has not been provided. It is not possible for Revenue to develop solutions that could provide access where an employer has not adhered to the statutory requirements.</p></reply>

The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that is possible. Eligibility for the scheme can be satisfied by an employer once they meet the relevant criteria.  </p><p>The key criterial for eligibility for the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that: </p><p>- the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p><p>- the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p><p>- the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by, in general, 15 March 2020, but recently extended, by concession, to 1 April 2020. </p><p>The latter two criteria were particularly designed to prevent abuse and exploitation of the scheme.</p><p>The TWSS scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the Public Service and Non-Commercial Semi-State Sector. This includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce.  The amount of the subsidy for each employee is calculated based on the average net weekly pay reported for January and February 2020. </p><p>There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed for any defined period due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to work full time or part time, with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Eligibility is not dependent on employees being in or out of the workplace. However, if the employment ceases to be eligible for the TWSS and/or the employer is no longer receiving a subsidy in respect of that person, the question of the particular employment arrangements that might apply between the employer and the employee is outside the remit the scheme.</p><p>The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income, reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS. There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but, for Revenue operational systems reasons, the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.  </p><p>If the employer makes an additional payment greater than the difference allowed by the scheme, then the subsidy value refundable to the employer will be reduced by this excess amount when the refund reconciliation is performed by Revenue in due course. The scheme is not prescriptive as regards the hours that must be worked.</p><p>Finally, Revenue published detailed guidance on employer eligibility and supporting proofs for the TWSS and it is available on the Revenue website:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

The underlying legislation and the scheme itself were developed within a very short timeframe to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the pandemic. The overarching ambition of the scheme is to ensure the key relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once the crisis has passed. </p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue by employers through the real-time PAYE System for January and February 2020. The key eligibility criteria for the scheme, as prescribed in the underlying law, are that -</p>  <p>  - the business is  suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic,</p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020, and </p>  <p>  - the employer had fulfilled its PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 by 15 March 2020, which was recently extended, by concession, to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020. </p>  <p>  The latter two criteria were particularly designed to prevent abuse and exploitation of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the weekly payroll submissions for February 2020 in respect of the business in question were not received until 10 June 2020, which is significantly outside of the &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 deadline. Revenue has further confirmed that the January and March 2020 payroll submissions were also not received until 10 June 2020 and that over the course of 2019, payroll submissions were generally not received until well after the required deadlines. It is for these reasons that the business cannot access the TWSS and it is not possible for Revenue to design systems that will allow entry to the scheme where the legislative requirements have not been adhered to.  </p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers.   </p>  <p>  e-Workers will incur certain expenditure in the performance of their duties from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs. Revenue allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also advised me that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p>  <p>  Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised by Revenue that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on this subject and on the question of how claims for e-working expenses should be calculated and submitted - see  their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax, which is available on their website.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is one of the main tools with which we are protecting the income of employees who otherwise would not be working and it is hoped that it will be a major boost in saving the businesses for which they work. As of 18 June 551,800 employees have received a subsidy since the start of the Scheme, 232,400 employees received a subsidy in the previous week and an estimated 410,000 employees were being supported by the Scheme having received a subsidy in their most recent pay period.</p>  <p>  Whilst I completely acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders. </p>  <p>  The banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore as Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, officials in the Department requested a comment from PTSB on how it is dealing with customer queries in relation to the matter raised by you and received the following response: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;We have a duty of care to our customers to ensure that any lending is affordable for them. In accordance with consumer protection requirements, we are facilitating mortgage-approved customers on the TWSS in drawing down their loans subject to their employers providing assurance on the sustainability of their income when the TWSS comes to an end. We are doing everything we can to support our customers at this difficult time and are working with them on a case by case basis to assess their individual situations.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  In addition, the bank confirmed that it is happy to engage with any customer, in a confidential way, to address questions or concerns they might have.</p></reply>

In view of this, I and my officials have been engaging with the insurance industry through Insurance Ireland in regards to forbearance measures particularly for business customers.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that at a meeting on 17 April with Insurance Ireland, I called on insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during this period. In this regard, I pointed out that a combination of the very profitable part of this market over the last 12 months and what is likely to be a significant reduction in claims for this period due to the travel restrictions that are in place, provided a strong case for premium refunds, thus providing some financial relief to their customers.</p>  <p>  On 24 April, Insurance Ireland announced that a number of their members (Allianz, AXA, FBD, RSA and Zurich) had signed up to commitments on premium reliefs for motor customers.  In addition, Liberty Insurance wrote to me directly informing me of discounts that they would apply to their customers.  It is important to note that each insurer has a different mix of customers and different claims experience and that the financial supports, such as refunds or discounts, applied by each insurance company will reflect their own individual claims experience to date. </p>  <p>  In regard to the response by the insurance industry to date, Insurance Ireland wrote to me on 25 May in respect of this and other commitments made by the insurance sector.  In relation to motor insurance refunds, they outlined that six general insurance companies had, in May 2020, announced refunds in premiums to Irish motor insurance customers totalling &euro;54.5 million.  I welcome the announcements as they are a step in the right direction.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that some have expressed disappointment over the level and manner of refunds and/or discounts.  In this regard, it would appear that insurers have applied a flat rate across all policyholders rather than looking at the situation in a more granular fashion.  For instance, a strong case can be made that those who have been cocooning deserved a larger refund, due to their cars being off the road altogether.  However, the methodology of the premium relief process is a matter outside of my control and it is important to note that each insurance company will make their own decisions as to the level and manner of financial supports, including whether to issue refunds and/or discounts based on their own particular circumstances.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would also stress the need for other insurers operating in the Irish motor insurance market who have not yet made such premium relief announcements to do so, as there is a need by all players in the market to take a longer-term perspective in relation to their customers.  I believe customers will remember and favour those companies in the future that have made steps towards meeting their needs at this difficult time.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, Ireland can and does apply a reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to supplies by yoga studios. The Directive does not permit the application of a rate below 12% to the supply of such services.  Ireland has a second reduced rate of 9% and a further reduced rate is not permitted under the Directive. Therefore, while it is permissible to reduce the rate of VAT on yoga services from 13.5% to 12%, this could only be done if either the 13.5% or 9% rate was discontinued.</p>  <p>  Gym membership fees are considered to be the right of admission to facilities for taking part in sporting or physical education activities. The Directive permits the application of a rate of not less than 5% for such services, and accordingly the second reduced rate of VAT, currently 9%, has been applied to gym membership fees. Where separate charges apply in respect of training classes, for example aerobic classes supplied in a gym, these charges are liable at the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%.</p>  <p>  Yoga studios may be eligible for financial support under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).  That scheme was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy. Detailed information is available on the Revenue website in relation to this scheme. </p></reply>

However I am not in a position to adjudicate as it is very much a matter for the insurer based on the merits and specifics of each case.</p>  <p>  For instance, on a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, in relation to commercial vehicle insurance, factors may include those such as the age and type of vehicle, how and where it is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the storage and use of the vehicle. Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.  While I cannot comment on the specific case referenced in the details supplied, a number of these factors may be influencing the reasons why the terms may change upon renewal. As I have consistently stated, it is my view that it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies in order to achieve a lower price where possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes in her question, the forbearance agreement entered into by the relevant insurers is voluntary.  As a result, neither I, nor the Central Bank, can enforce any of its provisions nor adjudicate on elements of it.  Nonetheless, I expect insurers to act in line with the principles of the agreement. Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, I asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism which provides proof of delivery.  My Department received the first &ldquo;Activity Report&rdquo; on this issue from Insurance Ireland on 25 May.  This Report shows that in the period 23 March to 4 May, Insurance Ireland members processed 4,093 forbearance requests for business customers worth a total of &euro;5,242,349.  My officials have sought more detailed information from Insurance Ireland on the nature of the forbearance being offered, as I want to be certain that they are adhering to the spirit of the commitment they entered into.  It should also be noted that my Department is in regular touch with the Alliance for Insurance Reform on these matters.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that if a consumer has a problem with the service provided by their insurance provider, it is advisable that that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p></reply>

The ARNWP calculation is based on the number of insurable weeks within the January/February period rather than the pay frequency used as this is a more accurate and consistent method across all types of employees.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that, for example, an employer payroll submission for an employee who is monthly paid and works for the full month of January 2020 includes a pay frequency of &lsquo;monthly&rsquo; with &lsquo;five insurable weeks&rsquo;, while another employee who is also monthly paid and starts work with the employer on 20 January includes a pay frequency of &lsquo;monthly&rsquo; with &lsquo;two insurable weeks&rsquo;. To correctly calculate the ARNWP for both employees, the use of insurable weeks rather than pay frequency is necessary. Using a pay frequency-based calculation on the second employee would be incorrect as the payment reported is in respect of two weeks work rather than a full month.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that, in the example referenced by the Deputy, there is no underpayment of subsidy. If the employee was paid for two full months in January and February 2020, then there are nine insurable weeks reported on the payroll and the ARNWP is correctly calculated by dividing the total net pay figure by nine.</p></reply>

A repayment of contributions is only permitted in highly limited circumstances, for example due to ill-health, and as such, this would be subject to income tax. </p><p>The policy rationale underpinning this is that the State provides generous tax relief on both pension contributions and fund growth to ensure that people have sufficient savings to fund their regular costs and expenses during their retirement. However, on actual drawdown a pension is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal tax rate. In the event of any early encashment of a pension fund the tax relief received must be clawed back. It should also be noted that any refund of pension contributions is governed by the terms of the specific scheme or product.</p><p>As is the case with all matters of policy, while they are monitored on a continuous basis, I do not have any plan at this time to revise these pension arrangements.</p><p>It is important to point out that a very significant and comprehensive package of measures has already been put in place to assist those who have suffered a loss of income arising from the COVID-19 crisis. This includes the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and bank-related forbearance measures.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, as of 25 June 2020, over 552,200 employees had received a subsidy since the start of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), 247,300 employees had received a subsidy in the previous week and an estimated 405,000 employees were being supported by the scheme having received a subsidy in their most recent pay period.</p><p>Revenue further advises that it regularly publishes statistics in relation to the TWSS.

Information in respect of these trends is captured in the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO).The most recent 2018 SILC data indicates that the median household disposable income was &euro;42,183, while the mean household disposable income was &euro;50,640. </p><p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s query concerning the percentage of households that have higher incomes and assets compared to 2005, I am advised by the CSO that SILC data cannot precisely identify the income of the same cohort of households as in 2005. I am further advised by the CSO that information on asset holdings contained in the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCF) does not pre-date 2013. Therefore it is not possible to identify the assets held by households in 2005 and compare those to household assets held in 2018.</p><p>With regards to the poverty indicators that the Deputy has requested, these are also available through the published SILC data. SILC produces three metrics for measuring poverty. Those &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty, are identified as those living below 60% of median equivalised disposable income. In this instance, the equivalised disposable income refers to the total disposable income of each household divided by the equivalised household size. This may also be referred to as relative poverty. </p><p>On the other hand, the measurement for &lsquo;enforced deprivation&rsquo; refers to households that are considered to be deprived because they cannot afford two or more of the eleven goods and services which are considered to be the norm for other people in society. This is a measurement for absolute poverty. </p><p>Furthermore, the &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; rate measures those who are both &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty and experiencing &lsquo;enforced deprivation'. The data for 2005, 2010, and 2015 as requested are provided in the table below.  The &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of poverty rate and the &lsquo;consistent poverty&rsquo; rate both declined from 2005 to 2010, while the &lsquo;deprivation rate&rsquo; increased in that time period. The impact of the economic crisis is evident in the rise in all three metrics between 2010 and 2015. </p><p>Table - Income and Poverty Rates, statistical indicator and Year <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>2005</th>       <th>2010</th>       <th>2015</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>At Risk of Poverty Rate (%)</td>       <td>18.3</td>       <td>14.7</td>       <td>16.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deprivation Rate (%)</td>       <td>14.8</td>       <td>22.6</td>       <td>25.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Consistent Poverty Rate (%)</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6.3</td>       <td>8.5</td>    </tr> </table> Source: CSO SILC data various years.</p></reply>

The objective of these mortgage measures is to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to reduce the risk of credit-house price spirals from developing. </p>  <p>  These macro-prudential measures apply certain loan-to-value (LTV) and loan-to-income (LTI) restrictions to residential mortgage lending by financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank. The current restrictions, which have not changed since the impact of Covid-19, comprise an LTI limit of 3.5 times the borrower&rsquo;s income; in respect of the LTV limit, for first time primary dwelling borrowers it is 90% of the value of the residential property and 80% for second and subsequent buyers (for buy to let mortgage borrowers the LTV limit is 70%). </p>  <p>  However, the macro-prudential mortgage lending framework also provides a certain allowance or discretion to lender to exceed these LTI and LTV limits. For example, in any one calendar year, lenders can give an LTV allowance to:</p>  <p>  - Up to 5% of the value of mortgages to first time primary dwelling buyers</p>  <p>  - Up to 20% of the value of mortgages to second and subsequent primary dwelling buyers</p>  <p>  - Up to 10% of the value of mortgages to buy-to-let buyers.</p>  <p>  In addition, the mortgage lending measures provide that borrowers who are currently in negative equity and want to move home by purchasing another property are exempt from the LTV limits.</p>  <p>  However, the utilisation and allocation of these exemption allowances is solely a matter for individual lenders, having regard to the lender&rsquo;s own credit policies and based on an evaluation of each specific borrower.  Therefore, subject to compliance with this macro prudential residential mortgage lending framework, and also to compliance with all the other relevant legal and regulatory requirements governing the provision of mortgage credit to consumers including the relevant provisions of the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 and the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; obligations, it remains a matter for each mortgage lender to set its own mortgage lending policies and to make its own mortgage lending decisions in individual cases and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.  Nevertheless, it should also be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, my Department maintains close contact with the Central Bank and Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland as the lending industry works to address the difficulties the COVID-19 situation is causing for both borrowers and lenders.</p></reply>

The system specifically requires that eligible employees were on the employer payroll on 29 February 2020 and that the employer reported the February payroll to Revenue before 15 March 2020. The 15 March 2020 deadline was recently extended to &lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020 by Revenue under its care and management provisions. Where an employer fails to meet these statutory reporting obligations within the required timelines, it is not possible for the TWSS system to generate any subsidy payment.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised me that the difficulties encountered by the company in question in accessing the TWSS arose because it failed to file its February payroll submission until after the extended concessionary deadline (&lsquo;before&rsquo; 1 April 2020). Revenue further advised me that the company also failed to file payroll submissions on time on a number of occasions since the real-time PAYE system commenced operations on 1 January 2019. The late filing of the February payroll submission prevented the TWSS system from calculating any subsidy on behalf of the company&rsquo;s only employee and it is not possible for Revenue to design a technical solution that could provide access in circumstances where an employer has not adhered to the statutory requirements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.214.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000057#WRD05000"><p>I am aware that there have been many concerns expressed about how the insurance industry is responding to the needs of its business policyholders in these difficult times, in terms of honouring business interruption claims and with regard to whether forbearance and other flexible measures are being offered to them. I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders. </p>  <p>  Whilst I have no legal authority to compel an insurer to pay a claim as this forms part of a contract between the insurer and the policyholder, I believe that as a general rule insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  I believe that they should  engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. The Deputy should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.</p>  <p>  The above said however, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much-needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that</p>  <p>  (i)  insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,</p>  <p>  (ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.  Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.</p>  <p>  In terms of meeting again with industry, my officials are in regular contact with Insurance Ireland on the above matters and are keeping me updated on developments. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting I have also held two meetings with the Alliance of Insurance Reform, the latest meeting which took place on 17 June.  These meetings were very useful as I was able to hear first-hand the issues faced by businesses in relation to insurance. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to be as pro-active as it can be on these insurance issues and will continue to liaise with the Central Bank and Insurance Ireland, as well as the Alliance for Insurance Reform on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

This was issued in the form of standard benchmark bonds, green bonds, inflation-linked bonds and ultra long-term (circa 50&ndash;100 year) private placements. This &euro;90 billion of funding had an average maturity of circa 14 years and an average rate of less than 1%. It included two new 30-year bonds, a new 20-year bond and two new 15-year bonds. </p>  <p>  Debt refinancing &ldquo;chimneys&rdquo; over the four year period 2017&ndash;2020 that had, at one point, stood at some &euro;70 billion have effectively been eliminated. By contrast, the refinancing requirement over the next four years 2021&ndash;2024 is far lower, at just over &euro;27 billion. </p>  <p>  Over &euro;23bn of EU-IMF Programme debt in the form of loans from the IMF and the Danish and Swedish bilateral loans was repaid in full and ahead of schedule. </p>  <p>  Large cash balances &ndash; presently around the &euro;30 billion mark &ndash; have been built up and these can be used to part-fund the deficit and repay maturing debt. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the purchase of &euro;17 billion of Floating Rate Notes from the Central Bank of Ireland since late 2014 and their replacement with medium- to long-term fixed rate bonds protects the state against future interest rate rises. This is ahead of the minimum schedule; a strategy driven by the low interest rate environment of recent years.</p></reply>

Accordingly there has to be regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The scoping exercise found that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188m and &euro;347m per annum (depending on the exact size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain) were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318m.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not a matter for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision in this regard.</p>  <p>  As a newly appointed Minister, I intend to give careful consideration to this issue and I will engage directly with the relevant stakeholders in the period ahead. </p></reply>

The membership of this Forum includes public service management and union representatives. </p>  <p>  It will be appreciated that the implications arising from this claim  extend well beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and impact across the entire Community and Voluntary sector. It is accordingly appropriate that the wider sector implications should be fully taken into account in considering the cost implications arising from this  issue.</p>  <p>  Taking this important consideration into account it is accordingly the position that a  detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The scoping exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain, were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  To fund an employer pension contribution for CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors alone would cost the State an estimated &euro;6m per annum, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payments, estimated at a further &euro;19.2m before administration/implementation costs. </p>  <p>  While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of those  many thousands of workers in the broader sector.  My Department has to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p>  <p>As a newly appointed Minister, I intend to give careful consideration to this issue and I will engage directly with the relevant stakeholders in the period ahead.   </p></reply>

It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations are undertaken as part of their development and implementation. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will inform these plans, supplemented by any guidance issued by the Department for the tertiary education sector when available. This protocol envisions close engagement between staff and their employers during the planning, development and implementation of these new workplace measures.

In the interest of maintaining the highest standards of safety it is not permitted to operate any bus older than 20 years on school transport services.  This standard applies to both vehicles operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and those procured from private operators.  There are no plans at present to change the current age profile of vehicles operating services as part of the School Transport Scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to the extension of the retirement age of School Bus Drivers it is Bus &Eacute;ireann company policy that normal retirement age for all Bus &Eacute;ireann staff is currently 66 years.  However Bus &Eacute;ireann Part-time School Bus Drivers and drivers nominated by private operators who operate service as part of the School Transport scheme may continue to perform in the role provided they hold the requisite licence and satisfy an annual medical examination until they retire at age 70. This policy and criteria is applied to all drivers who provide school transport services on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann equally.  As the policy has already been reviewed to extend the retirement age from 66 to 70, there are no plans to have this age limit extended at present.</p></reply>

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process.</p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary  for this process.  </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie. </i></p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. </p><p>Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed.</p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year.</p><p>Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are employed by the managerial authorities of individual schools or by Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  The Board of Management is the SNA's employer and the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management, subject to Departmental guidelines.</p><p>When appointing an SNA, it is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of the pupil(s) for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school.  Where additional training is required in order to carry out the assigned duties, the school authorities should arrange for the appropriate training to be provided to enable SNAs attend to the pupil&rsquo;s care needs.</p><p>Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.  It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally.</p></reply>

These engagements have included discussions and information exchanges surrounding the reopening of this sector.</p>  <p>The timeline and arrangements for the safe re-opening of English language education providers is guided by public health advice and by the Government's Roadmap for the gradual lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.

It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations are undertaken as part of their development and implementation. It is anticipated that the "Return to Work Safely Protocol" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business &amp;amp; Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will inform these plans, supplemented by any guidance issued by the Department for the tertiary education sector when available. This protocol envisions close engagement between staff and their employers during the planning, development and implementation of these new workplace measures. The experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be shared as part of this process. </p></reply>

The Council has engaged with the HEIs and their final year student teachers regarding the initial stages of the modified process including the importance of completing the vetting process without delay. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the registration process cannot commence until the HEI exam boards sit to confirm the final results. The HEIs have indicated that the majority of exam boards are scheduled for late June- early July. </p>  <p>  I am assured that the Teaching Council is acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that the summer NQTs are registered by the start of the school year and that it is actively working towards a timely and efficient registration process.</p></reply>

Provision is also made for early intervention for children with autism.</p><p>By its nature, the grant is intended to be a short term intervention and should not be regarded as an optional alternative to a school placement.</p><p>As tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that the educational programme provided generally reflects that which would be provided in a school environment.</p><p>It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard for Home Tuition generally reflects that required in a school environment. Accordingly, it is a condition of the scheme that parents/guardians must recruit a tutor who is qualified in the relevant sector, and is registered with the Teaching Council, similar to the requirement for teachers in schools.  </p><p>In addition, tutors engaged must be vetted by the National Vetting Bureau via the Teaching Council of Ireland&rsquo;s online vetting process, prior to the commencement of the delivery of tuition.</p><p>My Department has no flexibility in this regard.</p><p>The same conditions apply whether Parents use the grant to engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or private providers to deliver tuition in a group setting.</p><p>The Teaching Council of Ireland outlines that it will endeavour to process applications for registration within 4-6 weeks. For people holding overseas qualifications it is within 12 weeks. The Council has confirmed that it is currently meeting these processing times.</p></reply>

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing IT provision. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. </p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. </p>  <p>  Although equipment is sanctioned under the Assistive Technology scheme for use by particular students, it is the property of the school, and the school&rsquo;s management authority is responsible for maintenance, repair, and insurance of the equipment. </p>  <p>  In relation to the child named by the Deputy in his correspondence, an application has yet to be received by my Department, and may still be with the SENO for processing. The Deputy&rsquo;s query will therefore be forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

These are students who entered for their examinations as external candidates and who indicated that they were not attending for tuition at any school, or centre of education recognised by the State Examinations Commission for the purposes of holding examinations.</p><p>The Calculated Grades Executive Office (CGEO) is emailing each of the 923 students who are classified as out-of-school learners to outline the steps they need to follow to be considered for Calculated Grades.  The process is set out in the <i>Guide to Calculated Grades for Out-of-school Learners </i>which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The arrangements seek to include as many out-of-school students as possible in the Calculated Grades system provided that there is credible, satisfactory evidence from an appropriate source, on which an estimated percentage mark can be based.</p><p>The process for out-of-school students seeks to mirror the fundamental principles which applied to the Calculated Grades process which schools have undertaken for their students. Both schemes are grounded in principles of objectivity, fairness, and equity.  It is necessary to ensure students in both categories are treated in a comparable manner which means that those exercising professional judgement on their behalf should not rely on any one source of evidence.In the school based process, teachers were advised to exercise caution in relation to pre-Leaving Certificate (&ldquo;mock&rdquo;) examinations.  Students in this group will be asked to apply to the CGEO by sending the application form through registered post by Thursday 2 July 2020 with details of their engagement with tuition on a subject-by-subject basis.</p><p>Following assessment of the application, the CGEO will seek an estimated percentage mark from the source nominated by the student and will make an assessment as to whether the estimated mark can be accepted in line with the principles and requirements of the scheme. </p><p>Students will be notified of decisions, and  reason(s) for decisions, in writing and  will have a right of appeal subject to setting out grounds for the appeal.  The appeal will involve a review of the original decision.  Any student dissatisfied at that stage will have access to an independent appeals scrutiny process.  </p><p>Every effort will be made to provide a calculated grade for as many students as possible, provided there is credible and satisfactory evidence, from an appropriate source, on which an estimated percentage mark can be based. Where this is not possible, students will have the opportunity to sit the 2020 Leaving Certificate examinations at a later date when safe to do so. </p><p>It should be noted that the Irish University Association (IUA) announced on 25 June that, in the extraordinary circumstances of 2020, students who have applied for a Calculated Grade in a subject or subjects in the Leaving Certificate 2020, with a view to satisfying matriculation/basic minimum entry requirements and for whom the CGEO has been unable to award such a grade in the subject(s), will be granted an exemption in the subject(s) solely for matriculation/basic minimum entry purposes. Full details can be found on the IUA website. </p><p>A total of 683 students have yet to complete the initial registration process for Calculated Grades. Of these, some 80 are out-of-school learners. The Calculated Grades Executive Office continues to attempt to engage with those students yet to register, through making direct contact with the students themselves. </p></reply>

To support the delivery of high quality Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht schools, the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme was launched in 2017 as part of the overall implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022. Under the terms of the Scheme, a package of additional targeted supports is being provided to these schools from September 2018 to support the delivery of high-quality Irish-medium education. These additional supports include:  </p>  <p>  - access to an annual grant of &euro;1200 grant for the purchase of Irish-medium teaching resources</p>  <p>  - additional Irish-language support teaching hours based on school enrolment </p>  <p>  - additional continuing professional development for teachers, delivered by COGG</p>  <p>  - additional Inspectorate support via advisory visits to support schools in meeting their targets in the implementation of Irish-language-based criteria.</p>  <p>  Schools in the Scheme have also been permitted to form clusters to create temporary full-time posts by combining part-time Irish language support hours. From 2019 schools in the Scheme had the option to combine part-time Irish language support hours with special education teaching hours to create temporary full-time posts, provided that teachers selected had a high level of proficiency in the Irish language and an understanding of immersion education, so that they could fulfill the roles, as appropriate.</p></reply>

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.</p><p>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: </p><p>For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally. Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point. </p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.</p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i></p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><i>  </i></p><p><i>  </i></p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September 2019. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10 January 2020, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21 January 2020.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p><p>A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p><p>When considering whether a student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, the grant awarding authority (SUSI) is obliged to satisfy itself beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant. The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as requested by the grant awarding authority.  </p><p>Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p><p>Further information regarding class of applicant (independent or dependent) and the types of documentation accepted as evidence of living independently from parents is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website: <i></i>. </p><p>If the student in question considers that he has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he may appeal this decision to SUSI within the statutory time limit of 30 days of his decision letter. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted online by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe of 30 days. </p></reply>

There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. </p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>A survey of Secretaries and Caretakers undertaken in 2019 identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0076_2018.pdf.</i></p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0077_2018.pdf.</i></p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September 2019. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10 January 2020, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21 January 2020.</p></reply>

Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning. </p>  <p>  The aim of these distance learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  </p>  <p>  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, the Department recently published a report to Government on Planning for reopening schools in line with the Roadmap for reopening. This report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with relevant agencies, including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), identified the following key priorities in supporting students in re-engaging with the curriculum in the new school year:</p>  <p>  1. The wellbeing and socialisation of students</p>  <p>  2. Assessing where students are in terms of their learning</p>  <p>  3. Identifying the additional supports that particular learners may require</p>  <p>  4. Exploring options for remote provision that will compliment in-school provision and address curriculum gaps experienced during school closure</p>  <p>  It is recognised that schools continue to be best placed to make decisions about how to support and educate all their learners during this period. My Department will continue to collaborate with the NCCA to develop guidance to schools to assist them in their planning for the next school year so as to ensure that curricular priorities are delivered and that teaching and learning is optimal in these circumstances, guided at all times by public health advice.</p>  <p>  Students going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of their preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021. The State Examinations Commission (SEC) has statutory responsibility for the operation of the state examinations. My Department will engage with the SEC in their development of fair and robust assessment arrangements in relation to both the Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making. </p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  Minister McHugh is fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.  This additional funding issued to schools in May 2020.  </p><p>A range of supports and guidance have also been provided for schools to assist schools in providing for the education for children with special educational needs during the school closure period. </p><p>Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at <i>www.education.ie/en/covid-19/#14.  </i></p><p>In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:</p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-pupils-with-sen-primary.pdf. </i></p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-students-with-sen-post-primary.pdf.</i></p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.</p><p>It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.</p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. </p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.</p><p>In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools&rsquo; closure. </p><p>Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on &lsquo;Visiting Teachers Support&rsquo; for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment</p><p>Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at: </p><p><i>https://ncse.ie/online-resources.  </i></p><p>The Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice &amp;amp; resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at <i>.  </i><b></b></p><p>Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at <i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Post-Primary-School-Policies/Policies/Guidance-Plan.html. </i></p><p>Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at: </p><p><i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/continuity-of-schooling/continuity-of-schooling.html</i>.</p><p>I also recently announced that a special &euro;10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.</p><p>This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby &euro;40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. &euro;10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.</p><p>While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.</p><p>Pending the wider re opeing of schools, my Department also published on 12th June, 2020, details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  </p><p>Summer Provision 2020 &ndash; Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child&rsquo;s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs. </p><p>The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:</p><p>Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism </p><p>Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties</p><p>Any child in a special class or special school </p><p>Children transitioning into a special class from early year&rsquo;s settings</p><p>Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities: </p><p>Children with Down syndrome </p><p>Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing </p><p>Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment </p><p>Children who have a moderate general learning disability </p><p>Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties </p><p>All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate. </p><p>Home-based provision will be available where a child&rsquo;s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.</p><p>The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  </p><p>A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on <i>Gov.ie/summerprovision.</i></p><p>Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.</p><p>Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child&rsquo;s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA. </p><p>Full information on the scheme and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at <i>Gov.ie/summerprovision.</i></p></reply>

Two weeks must be taken before the baby is due, and at least four weeks must be taken after the birth. </p>  <p>  Any amendment to the legislation governing the provision of maternity leave, which falls under my responsibility, would require primary legislation.  The provision of maternity benefit is under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p>  <p>  It should be noted too that, in addition to maternity leave, each parent may also avail of two weeks of parent&rsquo;s leave during the first year of a child&rsquo;s life and may qualify for parent&rsquo;s benefit during this period.  Parental leave is also available which entitles parents to take unpaid leave from work to spend time looking after their children. Parents can take up to 22 weeks of parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday. </p>  <p>  Consideration is being given currently to all issues.</p>  <p>  On 29 May the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme to accommodate the salaries of parents returning from maternity or adoptive leave. The changes are aimed at individuals who may not have been on the payroll of their employer on 29 February, or been paid in either January or February 2020 and will allow for consistent treatment with other employees.  The amendment will be legislated for later in the year as part of the usual Finance Bill 2020 process, but in the interim Revenue has agreed to provide a facility to accommodate such cases. Although expected to be implemented on the 12th June, Revenue launched a new process on Monday 8th June which allows employers to include employees returning to employment after a period of paternity, parental or related unpaid leave or were in receipt of Health and Safety Benefit, Parent&rsquo;s Benefit or Illness Benefit paid by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).  Employers who wish to access the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on behalf of eligible employees covered by these changes can do so by completing a short form available for download via MyEnquiries in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service (ROS). The relevant details that employers will need to provide to Revenue include current contractual gross pay, pay frequency, normal PRSI class, type of leave the returning employee availed of and the date of return to work. Any retrospective subsidy payments due to impacted employees will be processed by Revenue in due course. This retrospection will apply from 26 March 2020, the date of return to employment or the date the employer was registered for the scheme, whichever is the latest.</p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  </p>  <p>  Statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to identify those applications where a certificate of naturalisation for citizenship has been granted on the basis of Irish association.  The retrieval of this data would require a case by case examination of applications received during the timeframe specified and would represent a significant diversion of resources from day to day processing. However, I can say that there are currently 267 Irish association cases under active consideration by my Department. </p>  <p>  It is open to an applicant to apply under Section 16(a) of the 1956 Act where the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish association. Under the legislation a person is of Irish association if they are related by blood, affinity or adoption to a person (living or deceased) who is or was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen.  A civil partner of such a person may also qualify.  </p>  <p>  In such cases, the conditions for naturalisation set out under Section 15 of the Act, including residency requirements, may be waived on a discretionary basis. The onus is on the applicant to provide sufficient evidence of Irish descent or Irish association. </p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  The resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  As at 31 May 2020, there are now 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow. </p>  <p>  This total figure includes the Garda trainees from two separate intake classes who attested earlier than scheduled in March 2020, following an operational decision by the Garda Commissioner to augment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's capacity to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through specific enforcement operations.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the strength of Roads Policing Units on the 31 May 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, stood at 736. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Commissioner established the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau to ensure a consistent approach to road safety and enforcement of road traffic legislation across the country. This is achieved through coordination of enforcement and development of policy based on research and analysis of statistics and by engaging in campaigns in partnership with other State agencies. </p>  <p>  I understand that in addition to a focus on the lifesaver offences of speeding, seatbelts, mobile phones and driving under the influence, Divisional Roads Policing Units work closely with other relevant Divisional Units to target known criminals and to disrupt their activities through strict enforcement of road traffic legislation. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 6 Roads Policing Units in the Divisions across County Cork. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 31 May 2020 there were 84 Garda members assigned to the Roads Policing across the three Garda Divisions in Co. Cork (33 in Cork City, 27 in Cork North and 24 in Cork West). </p>  <p>  I am further informed that for the period referred to by the Deputy (2015-end June 2020), there have been 6 Roads Policing Units in the Garda Divisions in County Cork. I understand these are located in Cork City (at Anglesea Street as a Divisional RPU), Cork North (Fermoy, Mallow, Middleton) and Cork West (at Bandon and Macroom). </p></reply>

Further, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW</p><p>As set out in the response of the former Minister to Parliamentary Question Nos. 325, 326, 327, 328 and 329 of 16 June 2020, the decision not to proceed with a new Garda station in Sligo, as part of the Garda PPP programme, was made by the Garda Commissioner in his capacity as Accounting Officer and as the person responsible, by law, for the allocation of Garda resources.  This decision was taken in the context of the significant reorganisation of Garda resources which underpins the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Operating Model announced by the Garda Commissioner last year.  </p><p>As part of the reduction of bureaucracy and streamlining of administrative processes in the new Operating Model, the number of Garda Regions and Divisions is being reduced and Sligo Garda Station will be neither a Regional nor a Divisional Headquarters.  As a consequence, Garda management has decided that a building of the scale envisaged under the original PPP programme is no longer operationally required in Sligo and the allocation of public funding for such a project can no longer be justified.  </p><p>This decision was communicated to my Department by letter received on 2 January 2020.  The substance of this letter pertaining to Sligo Garda station was outlined to the Deputy in response to Parliamentary Question Nos. 325, 326, 327, 328 and 329 of 16 June 2020. </p><p>I am informed that, in order to ensure that there is adequate accommodation to provide an effective Garda policing service in Sligo, the existing Sligo Garda station is undergoing a very extensive refit overseen by the Office of Public Works (OPW).  This option has been judged by the Garda authorities to be a more appropriate and much faster way of delivering a modern Garda station, in accordance with its role in the new Garda Operating Model and having regard to the fact that the current location of the station is considered optimum from the operational perspective. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the ongoing upgrade works, which include the provision of new cells and custody management facilities, and future planned additional works, are intended to deliver a modernised Garda station in Sligo. </p><p>For the information of the Deputy, the following table, furnished to me by the OPW, details expenditure since 2017 on Sligo Garda Station including both the Garda and the OPW votes. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Expenditure on Sligo Garda Station (combined total, OPW and Garda Votes)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;58,362</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;116,117</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;711,093</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;143,275</td>    </tr> </table> As the Deputy will appreciate, this demonstrates the scale of the works which have been underway to ensure that Sligo Garda station is fit for purpose and meets the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>The OPW, as the body responsible for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation, is responsible for ensuring that public buildings are, as far as practicable, accessible to persons with disabilities.  The OPW also has responsibility for ensuring the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings under its control.  The Deputy will appreciate that these are matters in which I have no direct role as Minister for Justice.</p></reply>

In some cases the organisation continues to work with individuals in the event they enter into the custody of certain prisons in the State.  As Community Prison Links is primarily community-based, and only available in a limited number of prisons, the Irish Prison Service does not intend to make the service available on the prisoner phone system. However, I am advised that the situation will be kept under review. </p>  <p>  Regarding access to prisons, as the Deputy will appreciate, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic a range of measures including restrictions on access to prisons have been required to protect our prison population, in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that, throughout the Covid-19 crisis, every attempt has been made to maintain as many therapeutic services as possible for the whole prison population. These include services such as healthcare, psychology, psychiatry and drug counselling.  I am informed that new approaches were introduced to maintain and deliver these services during the pandemic, including innovations including telephone and video facilities for as many services as possible. </p>  <p>  I and the Irish Prison Service appreciate that many services are eager to resume contact with prisoners. I am assured that every effort is currently being made to broaden access and reinstate as many services as possible in a safe, controlled and appropriate manner and that services will be facilitated, insofar as is possible in line with national and international best practice guidelines. However, the Deputy will appreciate that such steps pose a number of challenges in a prison environment and must be carefully calibrated in line with ongoing risk assessments. The Irish Prison Service advises me that in this context, it will not be expected that all services could be afforded these opportunities, as the Irish Prison Service is limited in both time availability and the safe logistical access of prisoners to these services. </p></reply>

The legal aid scheme as administered by the Board is recognised as having a key role in a modernised family court system, as is the use of family mediation.  </p>  <p>  In that context, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the fact that comprehensive proposals for modernisation and reform of the family court system, which include the preparation of a Family Court Bill, are being developed by my Department.  Those proposals will involve a broad consideration as to the best means of providing access to various family law mechanisms available to those families involved in private family law cases, not least through the legal aid scheme.  That consideration, will also allow for an examination of the recommendation contained in the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality Report on Reform of the Family Law System concerning the need for a full review of the legal aid scheme, with particular regard to means test rates, contribution requirements and eligibility.</p>  <p>  As regards reviews in general, the Legal Aid Board reviews the operation of the civil legal aid scheme and submits proposals to my Department for consideration. My Department works with the Legal Aid Board on an ongoing basis in evaluating these proposals with the aim of optimising the ability of the Board to provide civil legal aid to persons of insufficient means. </p></reply>

With regard to the visa measures outlined in the document referred to by the Deputy, my Department is committed to retaining the current Stamp 2 permission and the ancillary right to work for students holding this permission. </p><p>On 13 May 2020, my Department announced that immigration permissions due to expire between 20 May and 20 July 2020 will be automatically extended for two months. Any permission which was renewed by an earlier notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20 May 2020 and 20 July 2020 is also renewed. This exceptional temporary measure also applies to non-nationals currently outside the State, provided the person otherwise meets the conditions set out in the notices.</p><p>On 26 May 2020 further measures were introduced to assist international students studying English in Ireland who have been impacted upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The new measures are as follows:</p><p>-  Students who left the State before completion of their studies due to COVID-19 may return and resume their studies and the duration of their absence will not count towards the two years maximum period of English language study allowed; and</p><p>-  International English language students with a current, valid permission who are still in the State and who have completed the maximum two years permitted as a language student, but due to COVID-19 are unable to return home, may remain as students until the end of the year provided they re-enrol in an online course of study for the remainder of the year.</p><p>These new measures to support students will provide some assurance and certainty for the coming months. We will continue to keep the situation under active review as matters evolve in our national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. This means, for instance, that students will need to ensure that they remain enrolled on their course of study.</p><p>MEI (Marketing English in Ireland) have confirmed that most colleges are now offering on-line courses, and students should contact their college directly to make any necessary arrangements.</p><p>Visa required students will need to apply for a visa before returning to the State if the validity period of the visa held has expired.  While the Immigration Service has temporarily ceased accepting new visa applications, persons legally resident in the State are included in the categories of Priority / Emergency cases, which will continue to be processed. Visa required students are advised to consult the Immigration Service website for the required documentation - <i>www.inis.gov.ie.</i></p><p>While both the Dublin area Registration Office in Burgh Quay and regional Registration Offices operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain temporarily closed, arrangements have been put in place for students awaiting first time registration, students who wish to change their permission applications and students who wish to avail of the Third Level Graduate Programme. </p><p>A new online Registration Renewal System for non-EEA national students based in Dublin was launched by my Department on 22 June, 2020.  </p><p>Students wishing to renew their registration will complete their renewal online without having to book an appointment or personally attend the registration office. The service will be made available to all categories of non-EEA national students residing in the Dublin area only, who are eligible for renewal of their permission to reside in Ireland.</p><p>Students seeking to renew their permission will now complete the application form online via the following link <i></i>, upload copies of supporting documents online, pay the applicable fee and then submit their passport and current IRP card via registered post.  Documents will be checked and, if approved, the passport will be stamped and returned by registered post and an IRP card issued by express post.</p><p>In general, the requirements for which countries are visa required to come to Ireland are kept under regular review in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. There are a wide range of factors that need to be taken into account, including the promotion of business and trade and facilitating people who genuinely wish to come here. However, there are a number of other factors that also must be taken into consideration when any change to the visa regime is contemplated. </p><p>The Government is pursuing a strategy of greater co-ordination and co-operation on visa issues with the United Kingdom (UK) in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and the future expansion of the British-Irish Visa scheme. This scheme, which is agreed on a country by country basis, enables short stay visa holders to travel freely within the CTA. Since its launch for China and India there has been a substantial increase in the numbers of visitors from these countries. As part of this greater co-operation, the matter of alignment of those States whose citizens are visa required is an important consideration. The greater the extent of alignment between the two jurisdictions, the greater the opportunity to increase the numbers of tourism and business visits to the CTA.  </p><p>As with all visa services worldwide, the overarching concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who want to come to Ireland.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage all students to regularly consult our updates on the website at: <i>www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/COVID-19-updates-and-announcements</i>.</p><p>A detailed Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document is also available on this website on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration and international protection. This document is regularly updated. </p></reply>

The &euro;150,073 grant, to be paid between April 2017 to April 2020, was awarded to the FAI following an open call for proposals for integration-related projects.</p><p>The relevant project combines football with English language teaching in order to integrate migrants into local communities.  Such a project helps build engagement between established local communities and those newly joining those communities. EU funding covers 75% of the project cost and the FAI provide the remaining 25% of the cost.  </p><p>The FAI received one (&euro;45,000) instalment of their grant to date in 2017. Since the project commenced, Department officials have twice carried out spot checks to verify the expenditure.  In addition, the FAI reports quarterly on financial and operational activities and these reports are reviewed by my Department.  </p><p>A decision not to make any further instalment payments of the grant to the FAI was taken immediately after the CEO of Sport Ireland informed this Department, in April 2019, of its decision to withhold future funding to the FAI.  The Department informed the FAI of this decision and that funding would only be restored once it become clear that confidence in governance for the organisation is re-established.</p><p>Following an audit of the FAI and revised guidance from Sport Ireland the following was agreed between the Department and the FAI in April 2020:  </p><p>-  My Department would restore funding from when it was suspended up until April 2019. However, the Department will retain funds until a final reconciliation is complete and a balancing statement will be issued. </p><p>-  No extension would be provided to the Grant Agreement which ended on 9 April 2020.</p><p>-  The FAI should provide quarterly reports and final reports to cover the period until the end of Grant Agreement.</p><p>At the time of this response the Department is awaiting reports and a final claim from the FAI for the previous 12 months.</p></reply>

They were subsequently received by the Immigration Service in Dublin on 20 January 2020, for further processing, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification. </p><p>The Policy Document contains a stated business target that visa applications to join non-EEA national family members should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application.  However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification. </p><p>It is not possible to give a definitive date as to when these applications will be finalised. All applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt. While every effort is made to process applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume and complexity of applications, the possible need for the Immigration Service to investigate, inquire into, or seek further information, and the resources available.  </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the way the Immigration Service Delivery function (ISD) of my Department conduct its business.  In line with advice issued by Government, HSE and the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), ISD has implemented a suite of measures to help in reducing the spread of the virus. These measures include the closure of our offices in Burgh Quay and the implementation of remote working for Immigration Services staff in order to comply with social and physical distancing measures. Unfortunately, these measures have led to a reduction in processing capacity. While delays are expected including in the processing of family re-unification visa applications, ISD is endeavouring to keep operating to the best of its ability.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Immigration Service website when available, and I would encourage the Deputy to view the updates and the detailed Frequently Asked Questions document on the Immigration Service website at: <i>www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/COVID-19-updates-and-announcements.</i></p><p>In addition, applicants can e-mail queries directly to <i>visamail@justice.ie</i>and may also keep up to date on Visa applications at<i>www.inis.gov.ie/en/inis/pages/visa%20decisions</i>. </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It is also essential that any arrangements put in place ensure the event is held with an appropriate degree of dignity and solemnity, as befits an event of such importance in the lives of our new citizens. Apart from marking a key milestone in the lives of those who have chosen this State as their home, the citizenship ceremonies satisfy an important legal requirement for the granting of a certificate of naturalisation as successful applicants must take an oath of fidelity to the Nation, as administered by the Presiding Officer, a retired member of the judiciary. </p>  <p>  Testing has already commenced on platforms which will enable the delivery of virtual ceremonies and as soon as the necessary arrangements are in place a notice will be placed on the ISD website and applicants will be informed.</p>  <p>It is my Department&rsquo;s intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow.   </p></reply>

Any case of non-compliance are referred directly to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) for follow up.  Section 31(a) of the Health Act 1947 (as amended) provides for powers of arrest for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Act and the regulations were brought forward by the Minister for Health.</p><p>The system of spot checks and follow up calls is being operated by officials from the Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on behalf of the health authorities. The BMU operate the scheme at Dublin Airport , which is the principal route through which people enter the State by air.  The Garda National Immigration (GNIB) manage the compliance for the other ports after which the passenger locator forms are forwarded to the BMU in Dublin Airport, who also carry out the follow-up calls for those ports. </p><p>The BMU has established a system to follow-up on all arrivals at a proportionate rate of a minimum of 70%, after removal of the exempt categories of passengers. The cohort of passengers failing to answer initial phone calls are followed up with repeated further telephone contacts. The first calls are made two days after passengers have arrived into the State. For any passengers staying in the State for up to 14 days or more, a second call will be made on day 10 to ensure they are still residing at the address provided and self-isolating.</p><p>The BMU operates 24/7 on a split roster over two terminals in Dublin Airport,  comprising of eight teams working a 12 hour shift. The current staffing numbers are as follows:</p><p>1 Assistant Principal Officer</p><p>2 Higher Executive Officers</p><p>18 Executive Officers</p><p>128 Clerical Officers. </p><p>Since the introduction of the Passenger Locator Form, every member of the Unit has been involved in the collection of passenger information and follow up phone calls to passengers. </p><p>The BMU are undertaking this role on behalf of the Department of Health until the end of June, 2020 at which time it will be necessary for BMU staff to revert to their core duty of immigrating passengers to protect and secure Ireland&rsquo;s borders. </p></reply>

As soon as it is practicable and safe to do so, inspections will recommence. Only permanent accommodation centres are subject to the formal inspection process due to differing contractual obligations on permanent accommodation centres as opposed to emergency accommodation.</p><p>Our absolute priority is to ensure the health and welfare of our residents, centre staff and the wider community. We have been working closely with the HSE at national and local level on a daily basis to ensure that we are taking the right steps at this time. </p><p>My Department has relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy after the crisis.</p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department currently has dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom</p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre management and their staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>Residents in all centres have been made aware of the need to practice social and physical distancing and good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Translations of public health advice have been provided to centres. During this time, centres have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser is in place for all centres and this is distributed as needed. Other PPE is also distributed as needed and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings.</p><p>During this time, to ensure that we are in regular contact with our centres, a dedicated communications team within IPAS has been established. This team undertakes regular calls with all centre managers across our network of permanent and temporary centres. Feedback from these conversations is reflected in the newsletters circulated to all centre managers  and to residents to promote shared learning and best practice. The  calls also ensure that any issues or concerns can be raised without delay for appropriate resolution for the benefit of residents and staff. In addition, residents also have the option to contact IPAS staff directly via email and can also raise concerns with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children. </p><p>My Department also established a national telephone support service for residents run by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and the Freephone number has been highlighted to all residents through one of our regular newsletters.</p><p>While inspections of accommodation centres cannot take place at this time, I hope that this information will provide you with some reassurance that we are continuing to work closely with the HSE and centre management to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

In addition, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles among the various Garda divisions.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>Significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million specifically for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021.

The work of the Committee will be action-oriented and practical, and requires a membership with practical experience from varied sectors, including the corporate sector. </p><p>The individual to whom the Deputy is referring has been appointed to the Anti-Racism Committee in her personal capacity because of her considerable expertise at senior management level in promoting diversity and inclusion in side and outside the workplace.  She has demonstrated a strong leadership role in championing diversity and inclusion within leadership roles in the corporate sector in Ireland and is personally very committed to this area. For her role and work in this area she was made a Chevalier de l&rsquo;Ordre National du M&eacute;rite by the French Ambassador to Ireland. </p><p>As a member of the Anti-Racism Committee this individual does not represent the interests of a particular company; rather she is on the Committee to provide her expertise and experience in advancing inclusion, equality and diversity in the workplace from the corporate sector perspective. </p><p>Given her track record, I anticipate she will have extensive action-oriented and practical insights to inform the work of the Committee.  </p><p>I acknowledge there have been concerns voiced regarding Sodexo in the United Kingdom. However, in Ireland Sodexo was awarded the <i>Gold Standard in Excellence Through People</i>by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in 2018. It was also voted one of the Best Large Workplaces in Ireland in 2018 by the Great Places to Work Institute. Sodexo Ireland has no role in managing any international protection accommodation centres in Ireland, nor does it run immigration detention centres as they are not used in Ireland. At a global level, the Sodexo Group has joined the G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition coordinated by the OECD. This is a coalition of 34 leading international companies who have made a commitment to step up business action to advance human rights throughout their value chains, by building inclusive workplaces and strengthening inclusion in their internal and external business ecosystems. </p><p>For these reasons, I am confident that the person in question is an appropriate member of the Anti-Racism Committee and that she will make a very valuable contribution to its work.</p></reply>

The current Irish Prison Service Complaints Policy is available on the website <i>www.irishprisons.ie</i>. </p><p>As set out in more detail in that policy, all prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and all complaints are treated with the utmost seriousness. Complaints vary in nature and seriousness - for example, some may relate to conditions of accommodation, quality of food or access to services while other complaints can be more serious such as allegations of assault, mistreatment or intimidation. The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a 'Category F' complaint. Further information on this system, including these categories, is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link: <i>www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-services/prisoner-complaints/</i>.</p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, or ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or any other conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Irish Prison Service. I understand that Category A complaints are investigated by persons outside the Prison Service. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of Category A complaints received in 2019 and to date in 2020 that were upheld, not upheld, not proven, terminated, incomplete or withdrawn is set out in the following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service.   <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 (as at 25 June)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outcome </td>       <td>Category A Complaints by Outcome</td>       <td>Category A Complaints by Outcome</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Upheld </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not Upheld </td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Not Proved </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Terminated 57B   (5) (c)</td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incomplete </td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>21 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Withdrawn </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Part upheld </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Discontinued </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Re Categorised</td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total complaints made </td>       <td>60 </td>       <td>24 </td>    </tr> </table> The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the length of time if has taken to complete the investigation of Category A complaints by prisoners in 2019 and to date in 2020 is set out in the following table, furnished to me by the Irish Prison Service. I am assured by the Irish Prison Service that, throughout the prison estate, every effort is made to communicate the outcome of any investigation to the complainant and all other parties involved (where appropriate) within a week of receipt of information on that outcome.   <table>    <tr>       <th>Category A Complaints Investigations completed</th>       <th><div>2019   </div></th>       <th>2020  (as at 25 June)  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 months or less to complete </td>       <td>0</td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 &ndash; 6 months to complete </td>       <td>33 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 &ndash; 12 months to complete </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outstanding investigations</td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>21 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr> </table> I understand that, due to the necessary restrictions introduced in relation to prisons in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, investigators could not be facilitated in entering prisons. This has resulted in a number of cases outstanding. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that all such cases have been assigned to investigators and these are included in the 2020 figures.  I further understand that investigators will return to prisons next week, to resume their work. </p><p>In relation to Question 318, I understand from the Deputy's clarification that the information sought relates to complaints by prisoner and not prison officers. </p><p>In relation to the total number of complaints made in 2019 and to-date in 2020 across all complaint categories, I am informed that unfortunately it has not been possible for the Irish Prison Service to collate this information in the timeframe available. I have requested the Irish Prison Service to compile this information and I will write directly to the Deputy with this information as soon as it is available. </p><p>Finally, I note that the former Inspector of Prisons carried out a review of the complaint system in June 2016 and made a number of recommendations.  His report &ldquo;Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure&rdquo; is available on my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>.  </p><p>I have been advised that the introduction and implementation of a new Prison Service Complaints Policy is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. I understand that work is well advanced on measures to implement the new Policy, which includes a fully integrated IT complaints system to streamline the management of all complaints along with a new appeal process.  </p><p>More specifically, I am informed that a new Complaints Unit has been established in the Irish Prison Service and that training is currently being rolled out to prison staff.  Amendments required to the Prison Rules, 2007 are also currently being finalised.  I understand that the Irish Prison Service expects to introduce the new prisoner complaints system before the end of 2020.</p></reply>

This system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' complaint through to a 'Category F' complaint.  Further information on this system is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service at the following link: <i>www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-services/prisoner-complaints/</i>.</p><p>The Inspector carried out a review of this system in June 2016 and made a number of recommendations.  His report &ldquo;<i>Review, Evaluation and Analysis of the Operation of the present Irish Prison Service Complaints Procedure</i>&rdquo; is available on my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>.  </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, among the key recommendations in that report was that complaints by prisoners should be subject to review by the Ombudsman, who would also be able to deal with complaints directly in the case of undue delay.  This recommendation was accepted and my officials, including officials from the Irish Prison Service, have been progressing the matter, with the aim of establishing a more effective complaints system for prisoners. </p><p>I understand that, in discussions on these matters with the Ombudsman, it has been agreed that his engagement with the process will begin after the new complaints procedure has been introduced and bedded down as an internal process in the Irish Prison Service in the first instance. </p><p>These changes to the Irish Prison Service process requires administrative supports such as additional personnel, changes to the Prison Rules, drafting of new policy documents and a new ICT system.  I am informed that work is well advanced on all of these measures and the Irish Prison Service expect to introduce the new prisoner complaints system before the end of 2020.</p></reply>

The renewal of permission is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions attach. </p>  <p>  Any permission which was renewed by the previous notice of 20 March 2020 and which therefore has a new expiry date between 20 May 2020 and 20 July 2020 is automatically renewed by this notice for a further 2 months.</p>  <p>  Any person whose permission was renewed under these provisions will not be affected on subsequent visits to the State provided they are for genuine short term visits.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that there is not an automatic entitlement to visit the country for 90 days.  As is provided for in Section 4(6) of the Immigration Act 2004, entry for a particular period is at the absolute discretion of the Immigration Officer examining the application for entry at the port.  Each application for entry to the State is assessed on its own merits. </p>  <p>Therefore, the person referred to by the Deputy should ensure that on arrival in the state they have all of the appropriate documentation, confirming the purpose of their visit, available for inspection by the immigration officer.   All relevant factors are taken into account, the principal ones being the purpose of the visit or stay, the duration of stay, the ability of the individual to support themselves during their stay, and proof that the person will exit the country on or before the expiry of any permission given.  It is important to note that the powers granted to an Irish Immigration Officer are not unfettered. The Immigration Act 2004 provides for the grounds on which an individual may be granted or refused leave to land at a port of entry.  </p></reply>

The nationwide network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) is supported by my Department.</p>  <p>  GYDPs are community-based, multi-agency, crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour. The projects aim to support young people and bring about the conditions in which their behavioural patterns in relation to law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction.</p>  <p>  My Department has a responsibility to ensure that an effective GYDP service is in place for young people who commit offences and for whom the Diversion Programme is considered suitable.  This includes the need for local community-based GYDPs to provide intensive and effective interventions as well as activities suitable for young people with challenging behaviour and who need additional support.  The Department is also committed to ensuring that additional services will be put in place for harder-to-engage young people, who have not previously been seen as suitable for GYDPs.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department no longer provides funding to the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  This decision was taken after a long process of careful consideration and discussion, including with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na locally, and following a number of meetings with the organisation itself.</p>  <p>  Revised arrangements funded by my Department are in place in the area to ensure that the GYDP service continue to be available.  The replacement service providers are all GYDPs which had already been in operation locally and which have the necessary skills and expertise to ensure that the service is available to all young people in the area who could benefit from it.</p>  <p>I would also like to assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to making sure that GYDP services continue and indeed are enhanced in the specific area referred to.

These Acts aim to protect workers against certain types of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment that could occur in the course of their working life. The legislation promotes equality in the workplace and bans discrimination across nine different grounds. It defines discrimination as treating one person in a less favourable way than another person based on any of the following 9 grounds: </p>  <p>  Gender; Civil status; Family status; Sexual orientation; Religion; Age; Disability; Race; Membership of the Traveller community. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s equality legislation is robust and comprehensive, and is constantly kept under review and amended as necessary.

It is also an important aspect of the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</p><p>At an early stage in the Covid-19 pandemic and in recognition of the added risk of domestic abuse which some people face in that context, my Department developed an inter-agency plan to address domestic abuse during this pandemic.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too confirmed that it continued to attach the highest priority to domestic abuse incidents during the pandemic, including through &lsquo;Operation Faoiseamh&rsquo;, a proactive initiative designed to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected throughout the period.</p><p>As part of this inter-agency plan and in addition to the funding already allocated for 2020, my Department has to date provided an additional &euro;285,000 to organisations in the sector, to support and extend the existing services they offer, during the period of the Covid-19 crisis. </p><p>The additional funding provided to date in this way consists of the following:</p><p>-  Women&rsquo;s Aid: &euro;63,000 for additional resources to extend the Support and Referral Service and the High Risk Support project;</p><p>-  Rape Crisis Centre Network Ireland: &euro;50,000 to support the work of local centres and to manage information on advice and guidance for frontline trauma support workers;</p><p>-  Ruhama: &euro;14,000 for additional support packs for women seeking to exit prostitution;</p><p>-  Men&rsquo;s Development Network: up to &euro;39,340 for an extension of the Male Advice line and extra telephone support for the Men Ending Domestic Violence programme;</p><p>-  Safe Ireland: &euro;36,000 for additional personnel capacity and communicating with their service users;</p><p>-  Move Ireland:  &euro;33,000 for additional helpline and counselling support for perpetrators;</p><p>-  Rape Crisis Centre Forum: &euro;50,000 for local awareness-raising campaigns and for development of a package of revised service processes, standards and procedures, including adaptations to new ways of working arising from pandemic.</p><p>Other actions under the plan aimed at ensuring that domestic abuse and sexual violence continue to receive the highest priority from the civil and criminal justice system. This includes priority by the Legal Aid Board and Courts Service for domestic abuse cases, and availability of a Legal Aid Board helpline to ensure that persons experiencing domestic violence issues get prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed.</p><p>I understand that Tusla has also put a range of practical supports in place including funding, identification of additional accommodation capacity, and provision of additional ICT resources.</p><p>You may also wish to note that the former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection recently announced that rent supplement would be made available on a short-term basis to victims of domestic abuse, referred via Tusla-funded domestic abuse service providers, with these arrangements to be reviewed after six months of operation.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that my Department is also leading a public awareness campaign on domestic abuse during the Covid-19 crisis, in partnership with frontline services in the community and voluntary sector. Further information on the organisations involved in this initiative as well as services and supports for victims is available on the website <i>www.stillhere.ie</i>.</p></reply>

However, the Covid-19 pandemic clearly presents unique challenges to congregated settings, including our prisons.  </p>  <p>  Covid-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges, in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners; in the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons; and the maintenance of staffing levels.  To respond to this threat, a very significant number of actions were taken by the Irish Prison Service, informed and guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in March 2020.</p>  <p>  In that context, the Deputy will appreciate it was necessary in the interest of the health and welfare of our prison population to suspend physical family visits in March, when public health restrictions on movement and gatherings were introduced due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Due to these and other measures introduced by the Irish Prison Service as well as the efforts of staff, Red Cross Volunteers and prisoners themselves, there has to date been no confirmed prisoner case of Covid-19 in our prisons.  Nevertheless the Deputy will appreciate that the risk continues and must be managed.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Government Roadmap and with infection control in mind, the Irish Prison Servicehas completed a comprehensive risk assessment on the return of physical prison visits to each prison, within relevant physical and resource confines.  I am informed that the Irish Prison Service plans for a phased recommencement of physical family visits from Monday 20 July 2020.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will appreciate the recommencement of visits poses a number of challenges in such an environment and must be carefully calibrated in line with ongoing risk assessments, taking account of latest public health advice, Government restrictions and the prevailing transmission rate of the virus in the community.</p>  <p>  To illustrate the scale of this challenge, the Irish Prison Service indicates that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, over 4,500 visitors entered our prisons on a weekly basis. In order to ensure effective infection control and allow for appropriate social distancing on resumption of physical visits, it will be necessary for capacity in both waiting areas and visiting areas to be significantly reducedto ensure family members and friends can resume visits safely.  This will impact on the ability of the Irish Prison Service to meet the anticipated level of demand for physical visits in the immediate term.</p>  <p>I am, of course, mindful of the ongoing impact of these necessary measures on prisoners andtheir families.  In that regard, I would note that parallel to the suspension of physical visits, the Prison Service introduced a number of new innovations including video visits, to enable prisoners to maintain contact with their families during these difficult times.  I hope that, as physical visits recommence gradually, it will be possible to continue the innovation of the video calls, which I know have been appreciated by families.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.928.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000068#WRP00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 to 339, inclusive, together.</p><p>At the outset it is important to be clear that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources.  Further, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW. </p><p>The overall purpose of the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.  The programme is continuing to make progress at a range of locations around the country.</p><p>A Public Private Partnership (PPP) project was included in this programme and at the time of launch, it was intended to deliver three new Garda stations- namely a new District Headquarters at Macroom, a new District Headquarters at Clonmel and a new Regional / Divisional Headquarters in Sligo.  As the Deputy will recall, it was unfortunately the case that there were significant delays in relation to this intended PPP, due in the first instance to lengthy processes for acquisition of sites at all relevant locations.  </p><p>At the same time, very significant developments were occurring in relation to policing in Ireland.  The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was published and is now being taken forward under the 4-year implementation plan A Policing Service for our Future.</p><p>In keeping with that report and implementation plan, the Garda Commissioner last year announced a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This new Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on Garda&iacute; being out visibly on patrol, engaging with communities, preventing crime and supporting victims.  As part of the reduction of bureaucracy and streamlining of administrative processes, the number of Garda Regions and Divisions is being reduced and additional power will be devolved to local level so as to enable the delivery of better and more localised policing services nationwide.</p><p>Clearly, this new model also has implications for Garda accommodation requirements.  Following a review of its accommodation requirements , the Commissioner and his management team decided that the PPP should proceed to deliver new stations in Macroom and in Clonmel.  However, the Commissioner determined that the provision of a new station at Sligo should not proceed as part of the PPP.  </p><p>Sligo station is undergoing a very extensive refit and I understand that this is felt to be a more appropriate and much faster way of delivering a modern Garda Station for Sligo, in accordance with its role in the new Garda Operating Model and having regard to the fact that the current location of the station is considered optimum from the operational perspective. </p><p>It is however important to note that, while it was decided that delivery of a new station in Sligo under the PPP was no longer justified, the Commissioner decided that the upgrading of the existing station to a high standard will continue. </p><p>The Commissioner's decision was communicated to my Department by letter received on 2 January 2020. </p><p>I understand that significant remedial works have already taken place in the existing station, including the complete upgrade of the three floors in the building containing the public office and the provision of new locker facilities. I understand that further upgrades are progressing and include the provision of new cells and custody management facilities. </p><p>I am advised by the OPW that property maintenance personnel are currently on site in Sligo working on internal upgrade works at the station, to provide a new custody suite including new cells built to current standards, prisoner processing, interview, solicitor and doctor's rooms.

Many farmers are part time or have employment off the farm and, being self-employed, many are reluctant to retire resulting in the average age of a farmer being over 58 in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority has an extensive agriculture health and safety programme which focusses on the provision of advice, guidance, e-tools and educational supports as well as inspections and investigations. This programme is completed in a collaborative manner and involves key farming stakeholder groups and relevant Government Departments and State Agencies. The focus of these efforts is to put measures in place that can prevent the high levels of injuries and fatalities that we see in the agriculture sector.</p>  <p>  In the past few weeks, the Health and Safety Authority ran a Farm Safety Media Campaign, which was specifically designed to promote the farm safety message, particularly regarding tractor safety, through TV, Radio, Farming Press and social media platforms. The Health and Safety Authority participated in TV interviews focusing firstly on child safety on farms during the COVID lockdown and, secondly, in response to examples of poor behaviour by young farmers featuring on social media.</p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority also conducted a specific Livestock Safety Campaign in the first quarter of this years during which 340 Livestock Safety inspections were carried out in addition to routine inspections. A revised Bale Handling Information Sheet has been produced and this will be circulated to all farm contractors.</p>  <p>  With the announcement of Government restrictions due to COVID-19, the Health and Safety Authority continued to investigate farm fatalities but proactive farm safety inspections were suspended. In recent weeks, the inspectors of the Health and Safety Authority have focussed their inspections on sectors and on businesses reopening in accordance with the Governments phased reopening of the economy with a particular emphasis on compliance issues relating to the Return to Work Safely Protocol. </p>  <p>  However, the Health and Safety Authority are resuming routine inspections across all sectors and in that regard, a Farm Safety Campaign focusing on Tractor and Machinery Safety will commence between 13th and 24th of July and the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee intends to deliver a new Programme of Work during 2020.</p></reply>

These Guides contain useful 'how to' information that can be applied across many businesses.</p><p>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Transport that the National Transport Authority (NTA) is engaging with local authorities to support them in the development of COVID mobility plans and importantly to also support the local authorities in their delivery of required infrastructure improvements. Dublin City Council (DCC) and the NTA have already published a framework of proposals to address the new and urgent needs relating to commercial activity and mobility in Dublin City Centre. As we move through the phases of the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business, improvements introduced under these plans will play an important role in providing additional transport capacity and also facilitating social distancing in urban areas. </p><p>The NTA has written to all 31 local authorities to offer its financial and technical support and this support will be funded through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport&rsquo;s sustainable mobility investment programme. The NTA envisages a range of measures may be required in our cities and towns, such as: </p><p>-  Widening of footpaths to facilitate queuing outside shops and enable social distancing;</p><p>-  Potential pedestrianisation of some streets where necessary and feasible to accommodate social distancing, particularly where this supports business activities;</p><p>-  Potential one-way systems to create space for footpath widening; </p><p>-  Altering traffic signal times to reduce pedestrian waiting/crowding plus the automatic activation of some pedestrian phases in order to aid pedestrian movement and to minimise contact with signal push buttons;</p><p>-  Providing additional temporary facilities for cyclists; and</p><p>-  Provision of some external space where appropriate to support business activities.</p><p>I understand that some local authorities have already put improvements in place to facilitate increased active travel and it is expected these improvements will continue in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>Also, the former Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring T.D. has recently announced a new &euro;15 million call under the Department's Town and Village Renewal Scheme 2020 which has been tailored to address the emerging challenges associated with COVID-19. This means:</p><p>A focus under the standard Town and Village Renewal Scheme on interventions that can respond to the new challenges associated with COVID-19 and support the economic and social recovery of rural towns and villages;</p><p>The introduction of a new strand of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 2020 that focuses on immediate interventions that can be delivered in the short-term to assist towns and villages to adapt to COVID-19. </p><p>Full details of the Town and Village Renewal Scheme 2020 can be found at <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/01125e-town-and-village-renewal-scheme/.  </i></p><p>In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the restart grant (to help small businesses with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures), wage subsidy scheme, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. </p><p>The Restart Grant gives direct grant aid to micro and small businesses to help them with the costs associated with reopening and reemploying workers following COVID-19 closures. The Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30 June 2020. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, or a minimum grant of &euro;2,000, whichever is the higher, with a maximum grant of &euro;10,000.

The measures have been developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need and are targeted at vulnerable but viable companies.</p><p>The former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty on 25 June announced that her Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Support Grant will be made available to assist self-employed recipients who are exiting the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme with a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to re-start their business. This will provide business owners with a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to re-start their business. A fund of &euro;12m has been allocated for the extension of this grant. The grant will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises which employ fewer than 10 people, have an annual turnover of less than &euro;1 million and are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.</p><p>The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to aid SMEs is a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available.  The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors.  The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has commenced. </p><p>In addition to this new package of liquidity measures, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p><p>Any eligible business, including the self-employed, can apply for the following supports. The most appropriate support will depend on the characteristics of the business.</p><p>MicroFinance Ireland can provide loans of up to &euro;50,000 as an immediate measure to specifically deal with exceptional circumstances that micro-enterprises &ndash; (any business -Sole Trader, Partnership or Limited Company with less than 10 full time employees and annual turnover of up to &euro;2m)- are facing.</p><p>Local Enterprise Offices have moved training programmes, workshops and networking meet-ups online, covering areas such as cash management in a crisis, leading your business through COVID-19 and advice for employers impacted by the crisis. Training programmes are free of charge and places can be booked online, through your Local Enterprise Office.</p><p>For existing businesses that meet eligibility criteria (such as employing 10 or fewer people with the potential for growth and job creation), Local Enterprise Offices can also offer financial supports to help manage current market challenges such as Business Priming Grants, Business Expansion Grants, Feasibility Study Grants and Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters Grant</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and with all stakeholders, to examine all such appropriate business supports to assist enterprises, including self-employed service providers, impacted by Covid-19.  I will keep the supports provided under review and continue to support businesses as they work through the challenges facing them. </p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Transport may be able to provide more specific guidance on supports designed to assist businesses in the transport sector, such as taxi providers.</p></reply>

In the first instance, it was included as a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Diseases Regulations 2020. Any infectious disease pandemic is first and foremost a matter of public health, for which a legal basis already exists in Irish law under public health legislation and specifically under Infectious Diseases Regulations. </p><p>In addition, notifiable infectious diseases are statutorily reportable under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981 to the Medical Officer of Health for their investigation and control.</p><p>The reporting of COVID-19 incidents among healthcare workers is also a statutory requirement, reportable to the National Incident Management System (NIMS). </p><p>In relation to the reporting of COVID-19 related workplace absences to the Health and Safety Authority, there is no provision in occupational health and safety legislation for the reporting of cases of occupationally acquired COVID-19. Employers are not necessarily in a position to assess or attribute occupational disease or illness from COVID-19 with a degree of reliability since COVID-19 can be acquired in either a community or a workplace setting. Neither is there an obligation on employees to provide detailed confidential medical information to their employer. Any requirement on employers to capture occupational diseases and illnesses would have GDPR implications and would breech an individual&rsquo;s right to the privacy of their medical information in terms of the relationship with their employer.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority is fully aware of all occupational health and safety risks, including COVID-19, in healthcare settings and is engaged with the Health Service Executive, individual employers and places of work in this regard. The reporting of an accident to the Health and Safety Authority under current statutory reporting requirements does not necessarily result in an investigation. However, I would also say that any employee in any workplace who has a serious concern on an occupational health and safety matter can bring this to the attention of the Health and Safety Authority. Also, the Health and Safety Authority can also access necessary information needed to identify and investigate relevant cases in any sector and has legislative powers to request data from any employer, if and as needed. </p><p>As part of its role in promoting the prevention of risks to safety, health and welfare at work the Health and Safety Authority continues to provide resources, advice and support to employers and workers through its website and other means, including the operation of a confidential helpline for workers, employers and others. </p><p>Separately I would like to point out that it is the SARs-COV-2 (the virus that causes the disease COVID 19) that was included in the recent amendment to the Biological Agents Directive and not the disease COVID-19. The recent inclusion of SARs-COV-2 in the Biological Agents Directive provides that where the nature of the work poses an occupational exposure health risk to the virus,  such as in laboratories, healthcare settings, etc, employers are required to ensure that an appropriate Biological Agents Risk Assessment is carried out. The existing Code of Practice for Biological Agents will be updated to include SARs-COV-2 and in the interim, the Health and Safety Authority has information available on its website (<i>www.hsa.ie</i>)</p><p>I understand that the Health and Safety Authority will be reviewing the statutory requirements for the reporting of workplace injuries over the coming weeks and will forward a report on the matter to my Department for consideration. </p></reply>

The Authority is the lead agency in relation to the Return to Work Safely Protocol and in encouraging and checking compliance with the Protocol.</p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the whole of Government approach and to supplement the efforts of the HSA inspectors, 500 other inspectors from across the system are now monitoring the application of the Protocol as part of their normal inspection duties. These resources are being drawn from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environmental Health Officers employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE). These additional inspectors are supporting the Health and Safety Authority in carrying out checks on compliance with the Protocol as part of their normal inspections.  Furthermore, 7 Staff from my Department have been seconded to the Workplace Contact Unit of the Health and Safety Authority to assist in managing phone and email queries about the Return to Work Safely Protocol</p>  <p>  If an employee has concerns about a workplace compliance with the Protocol they can  contact the Health and Safety Authority Workplace Contact Unit (WCU) on a confidential basis at 1890 289  389 or by sending an email to wcu@hsa.ie. If following such a complaint, there are serious concerns about a particular workplace, the Health and Safety Authority or another agency or organisation tasked with inspecting workplace compliance with the Protocol, will follow-up as appropriate. Where businesses have not fully complied with the Protocol, any matters that need to be addressed are the subject of the inspection report and are followed up so as to ensure compliance. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that  Health and Safety Authority carries out inspections and manages complaints on a confidential basis. In order to achieve compliance with the Protocol the Health and Safety Authority can use its full range of powers. Any initial engagement with an employer is with the aim of achieving the required outcomes through consensus and collaborative agreement e.g. advice, Reports of Inspections (ROI). However a failure to comply with a ROI is an offence.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Health and Safety Authority has produced checklists and templates to support implementation of the Protocol which have now been downloaded over 130,000 times and feedback on these from a range of employer and employee groups has been very positive. The Health and Safety Authority has noted a high level of compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol to date during Phases 1 and 2. </p>  <p>  The running of Public Health campaigns would be a matter for the Department of Health which has overall responsibility for public health matters.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people.  </p>  <p>  The resumption of adult day services is currently being considered by my Department and the HSE as part of broader planning to prepare for the resumption of non-COVID-19 community and social care services in the current environment, and in line with public health guidance. My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity. </p>  <p>  The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-COVID supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the disability sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. A national group for the resumption of day services representative of service users and families, service providers and the HSE is working together to prepare for the resumption of day service supports in line with COVID-19 guidance. The Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services and Action Plan for resumption of services have been completed. The national group are currently developing guidance to support the day service sector to reopen within the parameters of public health advice.</p>  <p>  Community Healthcare Organisations are working with service providers to ascertain the current level of service provision and innovative practises that have developed over the last number of months. The collation and analysis of this data will provide a current national picture which will enable the resumption group to address the challenges of reopening day service locations. </p>  <p>  The resumption group plan to have completed the above strands of work shortly, following which a timeframe for the phased reopening of adult day services will be planned in cooperation with HSE disability services and service providers. In the meantime, service providers continue to contact day service users regarding their support needs and are providing those supports in different ways.  Some supports continue to be provided in a number of ways, for example by telephone, online communication and responses to address emergency needs. </p>  <p>  The HSE and disability service providers, where identified, will continue to communicate with school leavers and their families to plan and organise for a transition to day services in line with public health guidance.</p>  <p>  The safety of service users and staff is of critical importance therefore the attendance at locations will be determined by public health guidance, which may result in some reduction of capacity.</p>  <p>  An information leaflet for service users and their families was developed by the national group and distributed widely to all stakeholders on June 9th. </p>  <p>  It is expected that a clearer picture will emerge shortly as to when day services are likely to be reinstated and how the service will be delivered taking account of Public Health Guidance and COVID-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services and the information leaflet &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Happening&rdquo; is available on the New Directions website:  www.hse.ie/newdirections</p></reply>

The Department of Health led the review of this policy, with a view to the development of a successor document which would continue the process of modernising mental health services and effectively promoting mental health.</p><p>The terms of reference for the refresh did not assume the need for a whole new policy document or a complete examination of policy from first principles, but rather to build on the good foundations of A Visionfor Change, particularly given that many of its principles remained valid in terms of good practice, and simply required updating and extending to reflect the best of current thinking and evolving practices in the sector.</p><p>Preparations for a review and update of the policy commenced with the commissioning in February 2017 of an Expert Evidence Review by the Work Research Centre (WRC) to inform the parameters of the planned refresh of mental health policy in Ireland.  The approach encompassed a stock-take of recent success in mental health and  a review of international developments, innovation, evidence and good practice. The review had a broad brief covering the various dimensions of the mental health terrain that might have relevance for informing the refresh of mental health policy in Ireland. </p><p>The key priorities that emerged out of the review were:</p><p>- The prioritisation of mentalhealth in Ireland as a major societal issue</p><p>- The importance of primary prevention and positive mental health</p><p>- A requirement to focus on social inclusion and recovery</p><p>- Expansion of mental health services to address the spectrum of conditions and needs</p><p>- Development of governance and financing to include research, evaluation and quality assurance</p><p>The WRC completed a supplementary paper to build on the work in the External Evidence Review, which identified specific policy changes for which a requirement may have arisen since A Vision for Change was drafted. The review identified policy themes that might require attention in the refresh such as the identification of vulnerable groups and associated actions not mentioned in the previous policy. The report also sought to consider new policy areas including a wider focus on education and prevention, and the wider use of accredited digital health interventions. In addition, the report sought to evaluate each recommendation from the previous policy and to rate progress to date on what actions were implemented, what relevant actions remained and what actions were no longer needed. Both WRC reports assisted in identifying priority areas for the newly formed Oversight Group to consider as they drafted their report for the Department of Health. Both reports will be made available on the Department of Health website.</p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Fees paid to dentists under the DTSS are set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2009 and the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2012. </p>  <p>  I understand that there are reports that medical card holders may have been refused access to treatment by a small number of dentists with DTSS contracts. The Chief Dental Officer in my Department is urgently pursuing the matter with the HSE National Oral Health Office to seek to ensure that no patients are left without a service.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of dental contractors have given notice of their intention to withdraw from the DTSS but I would hope that those  dentists would continue to honour their ethical and contractual obligations to patients during the notice withdrawal period to either provide a service or ensure that  patients are referred to  a neighbouring dentist who will provide a service.</p>  <p>  I would also expect due process to be followed in respect of any withdrawal from the terms of a DTSS contract, in particular regarding an appropriate period of notice.</p>  <p>  The cost of PPE should not be a key determinant in decisions on the treatment of patients. The Dental Council advises that dentists should take a case by case assessment when deciding if additional PPE is warranted. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has advised that regular PPE, which has always been used, is generally sufficient for routine dentistry.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that a small number of dentists had applied to the HSE for PPE until early May when the volume of requests increased. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. I am not aware of any agreement between the HSE and the Irish Dental Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  In order to support small, medium and larger businesses that are negatively impacted by COVID-19 a suite of Government measures is in place. These include a Restart grant for which application can be made online to local authorities and a Return to Work Safely Protocol designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority also provides information and advice for employers and employees in this regard.</p></reply>

Cancer services continued following the consideration of the risk:benefit ratio of treatment of individual patients, the prioritisation of time-sensitive treatment and the ongoing review of the location of the delivery of cancer services across all cancer clinical programmes:</p>  <p>  - Medical oncology services continue with the relocation of day wards where necessary. Physical distancing requirements will challenge the return of patients to pre-Covid numbers;</p>  <p>  - Radiation oncology services continue with provisions made for physical distancing and intensified cleaning regimes for the linac machines;</p>  <p>  - Maintaining urgent surgical oncology services is a priority with many services relocating to private hospitals.  Less urgent surgery was deferred at the outset and this is beginning to be addressed now:</p>  <p>  - Rapid Access Clinics for breast, lung and prostate cancers continue.  E-referrals to these clinics, compared to the pre-Covid months, are back to normal for breast patients (largest numbers attend breast clinics), but are still lower for lung (in particular) and prostate;</p>  <p>  - Symptomatic services for other cancers also continue to operate, in line with NCCP guidance documents for treating patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Patients are being triaged in advance of their appointments, and virtual/telephone clinics are in operation where possible.</p>  <p>  Cancer services across all clinical programmes are currently seeking to return to activity levels to meet the increasing service demand. This will include the diagnosis and treatment of patients triaged as non-urgent who may not have presented, or who had their treatment delayed or deferred, during the Covid-period.  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) advises that it will be a challenge to get the numbers back to where they were while implementing physical distancing and associated precautionary measures. The challenges arising will be exacerbated by the number of patients who would normally have presented earlier coming forward in the next few months, on top of the increasing numbers arising more generally in line with an increasing and an ageing population. </p>  <p>My Department is continuing to engage closely with the NCCP and others in regard to cancer services and work is underway to establish the requirements to sustainably provide for the demand. The focus is on facilitating cancer services to return to pre-COVID levels, as far as possible, and on how this can be done in a safe and effective way. Planning will include for any revised arrangements with private hospitals.</p></reply>

This includes monitoring of the Internet and online platforms for the promotion of unauthorised medicinal products, including MMS. The HPRA also engages with social media platforms to require removal of any advertisements and offerings that contravene medicinal products legislation, as well as taking enforcement actions against suppliers for offences in relation to manufacture and supply of the product, where necessary.</p>  <p>  Currently the HPRA does not have any evidence that MMS is being supplied by any website or other outlet in Ireland. This is not to suggest that such supply of this product, or other unauthorised medicinal products offered to treat autism spectrum disorder, will not appear in the future. It is also possible that information relating to and promotion of the treatment is happening via word of mouth, the dark web, or other relatively difficult-to-detect methods. The HPRA is vigilant in this area and will continue to monitor for, and investigate, such matters, including co-operating and working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and other State agencies as appropriate. </p>  <p>  The regulations in relation to medicinal products cover their placing on the market, manufacture, wholesale and retail supply and advertising. The unauthorised medicinal product known as Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) is governed by these regulations. Penalties for breaches of regulations are provided for by the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995 and 2006. On summary conviction, a person may face fines not exceeding a class B fine (&euro;4,000) and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year; on conviction on indictment, fines not exceeding &euro;100,000 and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, and in the case of a second or subsequent offence on indictment, fines not exceeding &euro;250,000, and, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.</p></reply>

In addition, the Programme will be extended to include all medical card and GP visit card patients over the age of 70.</p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Fees paid to dentists under the DTSS are set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2009 and the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2012. </p>  <p>  I understand that there are reports that medical card holders may have been refused access to treatment by a small number of dentists with DTSS contracts. The Chief Dental Officer in my Department is urgently pursuing the matter with the HSE National Oral Health Office to seek to ensure that no patients are left without a service.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of dental contractors have given notice of their intention to withdraw from the DTSS but I would hope that those  dentists would continue to honour their ethical and contractual obligations to patients during the notice withdrawal period to either provide a service or ensure that  patients are referred to  a neighbouring dentist who will provide a service.</p>  <p>  I would also expect due process to be followed in respect of any withdrawal from the terms of a DTSS contract, in particular regarding an appropriate period of notice.</p>  <p>  The cost of PPE should not be a key determinant in decisions on the treatment of patients. The Dental Council advises that dentists should take a case by case assessment when deciding if additional PPE is warranted. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has advised that regular PPE, which has always been used, is generally sufficient for routine dentistry.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that a small number of dentists had applied to the HSE for PPE until early May when the volume of requests increased. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. I am not aware of any agreement between the HSE and the Irish Dental Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  In order to support small, medium and larger businesses that are negatively impacted by COVID-19 a suite of Government measures is in place. These include a Restart grant for which application can be made online to local authorities and a Return to Work Safely Protocol designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority also provides information and advice for employers and employees in this regard.</p></reply>

The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p>  <p>  NPHET has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, in order to continue to provide access for patients there has been a considerable growth and investment in virtual outpatient consultations for many specialties across the system. The HSE advise that a total of 203,510 virtual outpatient consultations took place from March to May, representing 36% of all OPD activity over the three months.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid-19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists with a view to informing activity going forward. As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care.</p>  <p>  Evaluating the impact of delayed treatment forms part of two significant research programmes my Department is funding and participating in. In terms of the individual level impact, my Department is a co-investigator of an interim-wave TILDA COVID-19 survey which will seek to understand the experience of delayed healthcare due to the COVID-19 crisis. This project aims to examine the long-term impacts of the public-health led response to COVID-19 on the older population and will collate data on unmet healthcare needs. Findings will be prepared between October and end-January.</p>  <p>With regard to the system level impact, as part of the Department&rsquo;s Joint Research Programme in Healthcare Reform with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), work is underway to produce a publication by year-end which assesses the potential effects of COVID-19 on acute hospital expenditure projections that are currently being developed. One aspect of this report will investigate the scale of additional hospital activity required to reduce post-COVID waiting lists and maintain them at manageable levels. </p>  <p>  Both of the aforementioned work will be published when complete, and therefore will be publicly available. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Fees paid to dentists under the DTSS are set out in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2009 and the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2012. </p>  <p>  I understand that there are reports that medical card holders may have been refused access to treatment by a small number of dentists with DTSS contracts. The Chief Dental Officer in my Department is urgently pursuing the matter with the HSE National Oral Health Office to seek to ensure that no patients are left without a service.</p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of dental contractors have given notice of their intention to withdraw from the DTSS but I would hope that those  dentists would continue to honour their ethical and contractual obligations to patients during the notice withdrawal period to either provide a service or ensure that  patients are referred to  a neighbouring dentist who will provide a service.</p>  <p>  I would also expect due process to be followed in respect of any withdrawal from the terms of a DTSS contract, in particular regarding an appropriate period of notice.</p>  <p>  The cost of PPE should not be a key determinant in decisions on the treatment of patients. The Dental Council advises that dentists should take a case by case assessment when deciding if additional PPE is warranted. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has advised that regular PPE, which has always been used, is generally sufficient for routine dentistry.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that a small number of dentists had applied to the HSE for PPE until early May when the volume of requests increased. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is examining the issue of the provision of PPE across all parts of the health service, including health service contractors. I am not aware of any agreement between the HSE and the Irish Dental Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  In order to support small, medium and larger businesses that are negatively impacted by COVID-19 a suite of Government measures is in place. These include a Restart grant for which application can be made online to local authorities and a Return to Work Safely Protocol designed to support employers and workers to put measures in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Health and Safety Authority also provides information and advice for employers and employees in this regard.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly. I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  I understand also that this issue was discussed during GP contract negotiations in 2019 but that it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances.  The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care.</p>  <p>  However it remains a matter of concern to me that a GMS and GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

All projects are considered as part of this process. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. </p>  <p>  The final decision to proceed with the construction of a project cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal delivers value for money and remains affordable, and that sufficient funding is available to fund the project to completion, including equipping and commissioning costs.</p>  <p>  The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.</p>  <p>  The HSE actively manages the capital programme in order to ensure it has flexibility to progress as many projects as possible within the available funding, particularly in the event of any project not progressing as anticipated.  </p>  <p>  At present the draft Capital Plan 2020 is being reviewed and revised to take account of the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in delays on many projects and the funding of an emergency Covid-19 programme of works. Once the HSE has finalised its Capital Plan for 2020, it will then be submitted to me for consideration. </p></reply>

However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people.  </p><p>The resumption of adult day services is currently being considered by my Department and the HSE as part of broader planning to prepare for the resumption of non-COVID-19 community and social care services in the current environment, and in line with public health guidance. My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity. </p><p>The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-COVID supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the disability sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. A national group for the resumption of day services representative of service users and families, service providers and the HSE is working together to prepare for the resumption of day service supports in line with COVID-19 guidance. The Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services and Action Plan for resumption of services have been completed. The national group are currently developing guidance to support the day service sector to reopen within the parameters of public health advice.</p><p>Community Healthcare Organisations are working with service providers to ascertain the current level of service provision and innovative practises that have developed over the last number of months. The collation and analysis of this data will provide a current national picture which will enable the resumption group to address the challenges of reopening day service locations. </p><p>The resumption group plan to have completed the above strands of work shortly, following which a timeframe for the phased reopening of adult day services will be planned in cooperation with HSE disability services and service providers. In the meantime, service providers continue to contact day service users regarding their support needs and are providing those supports in different ways.  Some supports continue to be provided in a number of ways, for example by telephone, online communication and responses to address emergency needs. </p><p>The HSE and disability service providers, where identified, will continue to communicate with school leavers and their families to plan and organise for a transition to day services in line with public health guidance.</p><p>The safety of service users and staff is of critical importance therefore the attendance at locations will be determined by public health guidance, which may result in some reduction of capacity.</p><p>An information leaflet for service users and their families was developed by the national group and distributed widely to all stakeholders on June 9th. </p><p>It is expected that a clearer picture will emerge before shortly as to when day services are likely to be reinstated and how the service will be delivered taking account of Public Health Guidance and COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>The Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services and the information leaflet &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Happening&rdquo; is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i></p></reply>

Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. During these times there has been a particular emphasis on retaining a holistic view of the wellbeing of residents, remaining person-centred, being cognisant of their rights as citizens, and being vigilant that in seeking to shield them from infection that these rights are not infringed upon in to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p><p>As the disease is becoming more supressed in the community the National Public Health Emergency has advised that the gradual reintroduction of usual activities while taking public health precautions should commence. This advice is reflected in the latest Cocooning and visiting guidance. Detail of this guidance is set out by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre at: <i>  </i></p><p>Families are encouraged to talk to the support staff at the person&rsquo;s residence, to make arrangements for visits and other activities that can be facilitated within the current public health guidance. While it is appropriate in line with the public health cocooning guidance for activities outside the home to commence it is important to balance the risk involved in prolonged periods of time outside the home. These risks will continue to be reviewed in line with the disease progression and guidelines will be updated.  The Department of Health is very much aware of how difficult the current restrictions on visiting are for residents and their families, and we very much hope that this can be safely facilitated soon.</p></reply>

There is extensive guidance in place for healthcare workers and this can be found on the HPSC website: <i></i>. There is also clear guidance in place for the assessment, testing and return to work of healthcare workers. <i></i></p><p>The HSE has advised that where healthcare workers, including home support workers, require a test, they are prioritised and there is no delay in scheduling a test appointment. Where a person in receipt of home support requires a test, this is also the case.</p><p>In addition, current guidance requires the testing of all staff and residents when a new case emerges in a long term residential care facility (including mental health facilities) that have not yet had a case.</p><p>It is important to note that testing is only one element of a comprehensive strategic response to COVID-19. Testing for COVID-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test.  </p><p>Targeted, risk-based testing can yield important data to inform control measures, but does not constitute a control measure in and of itself. Testing should only be undertaken based on a public health risk assessment. A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic must include a strong focus on infection prevention and control and additional measures such as prompt identification and exclusion from work of symptomatic healthcare workers for example.</p></reply>

The model is fully aligned with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare and proposes a hub and spoke model, with services provided as close to home as possible but with access to specialist services where required. The HSE has clarified in the Model of Care for Neurology, it is intended that multidisciplinary services will be provided to Parkinson's Disease patients using an outreach model.   </p>  <p>  The enhancement of community care, the further integration of care and the establishment of multidisciplinary teams for those with chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease is a key vision of Sl&aacute;intecare. As part of Budget 2020, Sl&aacute;intecare has been allocated &euro;10 million in 2020 (rising to &euro;60 million in 2021) for a Sl&aacute;intecare Enhanced Community Care Fund. We know that our hospitals are under too much pressure and the way the system is currently set up doesn&rsquo;t work for staff or for patients, particularly those with chronic disease.  Moving care to the community setting allows us to reduce pressure on hospitals and support our healthcare professionals to do what they do best &ndash; provide world-class care for patients.     </p>  <p>  The Enhanced Community Care Fund is committed to delivering up to 1,000 community workers. Specifically, this fund will support initiatives such as:</p>  <p>  1. The hiring of additional dementia advisors and therapists in the community. This includes the recruitment of Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Dieticians etc., who will provide much needed treatment to those suffering with chronic conditions such as Parkinson's Disease;</p>  <p>  2. Prioritisation of initiatives that will have a positive impact on waiting lists, and in the first instance on community waiting lists. The reduction of waiting times for access to community therapists will be targeted to deliver more timely care for patients with chronic conditions such as Parkinson's Disease; and</p>  <p>  3. Maintaining and scaling successful Integration Fund projects into 2021, which will likely include initiatives that will improve the care for older persons and people with chronic disease.   </p>  <p>  A HSE business plan, setting out a model for a reformed approach to primary and community care, has been issued to the Department of Health. As we move towards service recovery, it is intended to finalise the Enhanced Community Care business case to ensure that recruitment of staff can be in place before year-end.</p></reply>

The advice is that a co-ordinated and standard national approach to the recommencement of visiting is taken.</p>  <p>  In light of the above , and on the basis that the COVID-19 disease status in the country remains in its current stable condition , the NPHET recommended that from 15th of June, the phased resumption of indoor visiting of residents in residential care facilities may commence in accordance with guidance issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre. The guidance which is published and available on the HSPC's website advises that indoor visiting in residential care facilities where there is no ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will be permissible from 15th of June in circumstances where certain criteria are followed. During an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 within a residential care facility, the guidance advises that all but essential visiting is suspended in the interests of protecting residents, visitors and staff.</p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult the restrictions on visiting have been for both nursing home residents and their families. Therefore this phased approach is much welcomed as it will both facilitate visits to loved ones across the country , whilst also keeping some of our most vulnerable members of society protected during this challenging time.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly. I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  I understand also that this issue was discussed during GP contract negotiations in 2019 but that it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances.  The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  However it remains a matter of concern to me that a GMS and GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19 care alongside Covid-19 care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, in relation to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments.

They have advised the Department that as of 3rd June, our recovery rate in healthcare workers is 93%. This is a higher recovery rate than in the general population, because relatively few healthcare workers have been hospitalised and very few admitted to ICU.  </p><p>It is worth noting that Ireland, in contrast with many other countries, maintains a very wide definition of a healthcare worker for surveillance purposes and hence international comparisons should be interpreted with caution.  In Ireland, a healthcare worker is anyone who works in any area of healthcare across community and hospital settings. It includes, for example, administrative staff, catering, maintenance, IT etc whereas in many other countries it is a considerably narrower definition of frontline workers or even just doctors and nurses. Our very broad definition of healthcare worker along with extensive testing contribute to our proportion of all COVID-19 infections that have been in healthcare workers.</p><p>There have been several studies worldwide of healthcare worker COVID-19 infection rates which have shown an infection rate of 5 to 10% of HCWs, whereas in Ireland this rate is close to 3-4% of HCWs based on estimates from the CSO Labour Force Survey of between 225,000 and 250,000 people working in Ireland who would identify as healthcare workers or as working in a healthcare setting.</p><p>In an article published by Hunter et al in the Lancet, on 2nd of May 2020 referred to a study in Newcastle (UK) on the 10th and 11th of March, where a random sample of hospital healthcare workers were tested and 5% were COVID-19 positive. This random sample testing was repeated on the 30th and 31st of March and 20% of healthcare workers were COVID-19 positive.</p><p>In a Dutch study (Eurosurveillance, Reuskin et al,26/03/2020), 400 healthcare were tested between the 27th of February and the 6th of March 2020 and 2.5% were positive for COVID-19. Between the 6th and the 8th of March 2020, 1,100 HCWs were tested and 4.1% were COVID-19 positive.</p><p>As such, it would not appear that the rates of infection among Irish healthcare workers are out of line with the experiences of comparator countries.</p></reply>

The following is a brief summary of the status of these projects.  </p><p><b>Electrical Upgrade Works at Mayo University Hospital</b>- A Design Team was appointed for the project in May 2019 and the design of the electrical and civil works has progressed in the intervening period. The project includes the provision of a new energy centre in the general proximity of the existing energy centre at the hospital. It includes the installation of new switchboards and the segregation of electrical load between two new transformers along with installation of additional generator capacity and associated civil engineering and building works. A planning permission application has been submitted to Mayo Co. Council and a decision is expected imminently.</p><p><b>HSSD (Hospital Sterile Services Department) Reconfiguration &amp;amp; Upgrade</b>- A feasibility study has been completed for the reconfiguration of the HSSD Department at Mayo University Hospital and detailed design is now being progressed for the project. The current facility was constructed circa 2000 as part of Phase two works and requires upgrading. The scope of works includes the replacement of the existing autoclave equipment and building reconfiguration works to achieve compliance with the latest decontamination standards. The existing HSSD facility will need to be kept operational during the duration of the upgrade works.  </p><p><b>ED Expansion &amp;amp; Reconfiguration at Mayo University Hospital</b>- A proposal has been developed to provide a new extension in the courtyard area at Mayo University Hospital. This extension would primarily facilitate the expansion and reconfiguration of the emergency department at ground floor level, while the Medical Assessment Unit could be relocated to first floor level. The exact scope of this proposal is currently being finalised with a view to being in a position to progress approval of the project and the subsequent procurement of a design team subject to funding availability and overall project prioritisation in 2020.  </p><p><b>Bed Capacity at Mayo University Hospital</b>- The options of the provision of single room en-suite bed capacity at Mayo University are currently being reviewed and appraised with a view to preparing a formal capital investment proposal.</p><p><b>Ward Quality at Mayo University Hospital</b>- A proposal has been developed to address a number of identified quality issues with regard to the current inpatient ward accommodation namely to upgrade en-suite facilities and ward bathrooms along with a window replacement programme for the wards. Progression will be subject to both funding availability and the ability to vacate areas prior to the winter period.</p><p><b>Interim Modular Treatment Space at Mayo University Hospital</b>- A proposal for temporary treatment / assessment rooms is current being scoped as part of potential further Covid-19 emergency works at Mayo University Hospital to support the segregation of patients during the forthcoming winter period at the hospital.</p></reply>

CORU issued guidance to the education sector in this regard on 13 March 2020 and continue to engage with education providers to ensure the timely and safe graduation of this year&rsquo;s cohort of students. </p>  <p>  CORU advise that many education providers are availing of this flexibility regarding Placement Criteria and are implementing other mechanisms to ensure placement hours are met, without compromising the standards of proficiency required for the profession. CORU have informed me that they have been made aware of many students who are successfully completing their placements.</p>  <p>  CORU advise students to stay in close contact with their education providers who can best advise them as to the changes they are making to their programmes to ensure they graduate with the appropriate training and qualifications.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department of Health led the review of this policy, with a view to the development of a successor document which would continue the process of modernising mental health services and effectively promoting mental health.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the refresh did not assume the need for a whole new policy document or a complete examination of policy from first principles, but rather to build on the good foundations of A Vision for Change, particularly given that many of its principles remained valid in terms of good practice, and simply required updating and extending to reflect the best of current thinking and evolving practices in the sector. PNA staff would have offered vital input into this original A Vision for Change consultation process. </p>  <p>  The Oversight Group consisted of volunteers, many of whom had full time responsibilities in their own organisations. The Oversight Group agreed to engage in a national public consultation process where over 1,200 participants including service users, family members, carers, peer workers, clinical staff, HSE management and the NGO sector who would offer input. This way of collecting feedback was considered the most efficient method of gathering data from most people. The stakeholder meetings were open to all, including staff affiliated with the PNA.</p>  <p>  The Oversight Group collected information from submissions, including a submission from the PNA, to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare in Ireland and incorporated relevant recommendations into the refreshed policy. </p>  <p>  In addition, the chair of the Oversight Group, Mr Hugh Kane, met with members of the PNA and input its views to the work of the Oversight Group in developing the policy. </p>  <p>  The policy proposes that a National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC) be established to oversee implementation of the policy. The Committee will be mandated to drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on the commitments made in this policy. It is expected that the Committee will work with partners to evaluate performance against the key performance indicators, check overall progress guided by research and learning from best practice, and gather information on examples of both good and bad practice. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the NIMC will be fully representative of those stakeholders principally involved in ensuring effective delivery of the policy recommendations, including strong service user, service provider and voluntary sector representation. All input received during the consultation on the policy, and any other stakeholder views, will be taken into account in establishing the NIMC. The NIMC will meet regularly and will publish progress reports on the implementation status of Sharing the Vision.</p></reply>

The forum brings together different organisations to provide important services such as collection and delivery of essential items such as food, &ldquo;Meals on Wheels&rdquo;, household items, fuel or medicine (in line with guidance) and support for those experiencing social isolation. More details on the Forum can be found at<i></i></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, community services such as day care play an important role in enabling people with dementia to continue living in their communities.  My Department and the HSE are undertaking work to determine the current level of service delivery in the community and to set out plans, including associated required capacity, to resume services, including day services, in line with the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and the &lsquo;Return to work safely&rsquo; protocol. This process will take on board the learning of the current period, including the possibility of delivering services in a new way, and the requirement to adhere to public health guidance. This means that services, whilst being delivered in new ways, will gradually be restored to older people, including people with dementia.</p></reply>

The list may have missed several organisations who were not on previous Eventbrite invitations. The lack of invitation is unfortunate, but the department was bound by an extremely tight turn-around time. Many individuals associated with the member organisations named would have received an invitation.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The conditions of the marketing authorisation are laid down in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) which accompanies and forms part of the marketing authorisation.</p><p>Pembrolizumab has been granted marketing authorisation for a number of indications and is included on the HSE reimbursement list for some of those indications. In addition, a number of other indications are currently being assessed for reimbursement.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.  Those measures included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement including Pembrolizumab, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician.</p><p>The establishment of such a comprehensive support package reflected the impact of the lack of disclosure of the result of clinical audit and the ensuing controversy on individual women and their families. </p><p>Following that decision, concerns were raised regarding the provision of Pembrolizumab to other cervical cancer patients on the same basis as encompassed by the Government decision of 11 May 2018.  In the light of those concerns, following discussions between the Department and the HSE, the HSE has put in place arrangements, on an exceptional basis, to facilitate access to Pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients on a case-by-case basis in public hospitals, when a treating clinician determines that this is in the patient&rsquo;s best interests. It is important to note that all prescribing decisions will be entirely a matter for the treating clinician, in line with patient safety protocols and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics.</p><p>Clinical trials for various immunotherapies, including pembrolizumab, are ongoing globally for a range of other possible indications which may receive marketing authorisation in the EU over the next number of years. Each of those indications will be considered for reimbursement as market authorisations are granted and applications received.</p></reply>

In order to urgently ramp up capacity for acute care facilities, an arrangement was agreed with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system on a temporary basis, to provide essential services. A Heads of Terms of Agreement between the HSE and the Private Hospitals was agreed at the end of March 2020 and all 18 of the acute private hospitals signed up to it. Under the arrangement, all patients in the private hospitals are treated as public patients and their treatment is prioritised based on clinical need.    </p>  <p>  The agreement was reviewed at the end of May and the Government decided that the existing arrangement should not be extended beyond the end of June. It has however mandated the HSE to negotiate a new arrangement with private hospitals which would provide the HSE with full access to private hospital capacity in the event of a surge of Covid-19 and separately with ongoing agreed access, to enable the HSE to meet essential and elective care needs.   </p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by the HSE that as of June 22, 11,531 patients had been discharged from private hospitals having undergone an inpatient procedure since the arrangement between the HSE and private hospitals came into force. In the same period 46,298 daycase procedures took place in private hospitals, as well as 71,967 diagnostic appointments and 44,865 outpatient appointments. Utilisation rates show that as of 22nd June 2020, 53% of private inpatient beds were in use, up from 43% at the start of May.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the more detailed breakdown requested concerning the average weekly bed occupancy rate in each of the 18 private hospitals covered by the deal with the State, for each of the weeks from 1 May 2020; and the number of patients treated weekly in each case, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The introduction of physical distancing, isolation, reduced social activities and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the accustomed daily routine and usual dynamic of social interaction for residents of those settings. The focus on interrupting the transmission of the virus is part of a wider requirement to prioritise the wellbeing of residents of disability centres, remain person-centred, be cognisant of their rights as citizens, and to be vigilant that in seeking to prevent infection that these rights are not infringed upon to an extent, or in a manner, that is disproportionate.</p><p>People living in long-term residential care facilities are particularly vulnerable populations in the context of Covid-19 and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to infection from this disease and for subsequent adverse outcomes.</p><p>The actions and measures we have taken in Ireland to support long term residential care facilities and their residents have evolved on foot of epidemiological data and guidance from the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

However, these are European-wide rather than individual Member State targets, and further clarity is awaited as to how these targets will be met by Member States. </p>  <p>  The International Union Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the global authority on status of nature and its conservation and works in support of the Ramsar convention on wetlands. Ireland is a signatory to the convention. In 2010 the Irish Ramsar wetlands committee was set up by the government to assist Ireland in meeting its commitments as a signatory. Membership of this committee is drawn from a range of relevant Departments, agencies, scientific and technical institutions, regional and local authorities and non governmental organisations. </p>  <p>  My Department is in broad consultation with all relevant stakeholders regarding preparation of the CAP Strategic Plans.  The recent publication of the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy and Biodiversity Strategy will have an impact on the future CAP, and the targets and actions set within them will need to be reflected in Member States&rsquo; CAP Strategic Plans. My Department officials and I will continue to actively participate in the CAP post 2020 process both at national and European level to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector, including the continued protection of wetlands and peatlands.</p></reply>

However, under certain conditions replanting grants are made available as part of the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme. Under this scheme the conversion of existing conifer forests to native woodland are eligible for grants of up to &euro;5,000 per hectare. Private forest owners are also eligible for an annual premium payment of &euro;350 per hectare for 7 years.</p>  <p>  In order to receive this funding the conifer forest must be adjoining a sensitive watercourse, where native woodland establishment can contribute to the protection of water quality and aquatic habitats and species. Water sensitive areas include Freshwater Pearl Mussel catchments, fisheries sensitive areas, Acid Sensitive Areas, and high status waterbodies identified under the Water Framework Directive. Where a marketable quantity of timber is realised from the felling operation, the quantity (in cubic metres) of timber must be documented and details submitted to my Department, together with evidence of timber-related income (including invoices and receipts). My Department may reduce the grant payable accordingly, reflecting the value of the timber realised and (where relevant) the normal costs associated with standard replanting.</p>  <p>  Applications under the Native Woodland Conservation Scheme  must be made before clearfelling takes place and applicants  must  ensure that  a valid felling licence is in place for any felling carried out under the scheme.</p></reply>

In an effort to ensure that all waste collections, both household and commercial, continue during the Covid-19 pandemic my Department established a Covid-19 High Level Waste Advisory Group consisting of key stakeholders from industry, the local authority sector and regulatory bodies. This Group, in cooperation with all elements of the waste industry, has helped to ensure that there have been no interruptions to waste collection services to date and ensuring that most civic amenity sites have remained open to the public for those without a household collection service.</p>  <p>  Since mid-2017, a range of charging options have operated, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste. This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

In summary, it provides that each local authority shall collect, or arrange for the collection of, household waste within its functional area. The obligation to collect or arrange for the collection of household waste shall not apply if:   - an adequate waste collection service is available in the local authority's functional area,</p>  <p>  - the estimated costs of the collection of the waste would, in the opinion of the local authority, be unreasonably high, or</p>  <p>  - the local authority is satisfied that adequate arrangements for the disposal of the waste concerned can reasonably be made by the holder of the waste.</p>  <p>  It is open to any local authority to re-enter the waste collection market as direct service providers ​if they so choose. Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 I am, as Minister, precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it. However, I will soon be bringing forward an ambitious new waste policy which will include new measures to reform and strengthen waste collection, while enhancing the position of the consumer. </p></reply>

These charges are regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and are entirely a matter for the CRU as independent regulator under the regulatory legislative framework. I have no function in relation to these charges.</p><p>The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy has been in place since 2001 and is the overall support mechanism for various national policy objectives, particularly focussed on the development of renewable electricity. It is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  The PSO levy has been vital in enabling significant progress to be made on the 2020 40% national target for renewable electricity and will continue to be so for the 70% target in the Climate Action Plan. Over the years, increases in the total amount of the PSO being passed though annually to electricity consumers have been associated with increasing renewable electricity generation, which is national policy, as well as resulting on occasion from lower wholesale electricity prices.</p><p>The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Order 2002 provides that the calculation of the PSO is a matter for CRU and also sets out the manner in which CRU is to calculate it.  CRU has recently published for consultation its proposed decision on the 2020/2021 levy, with its calculation of the levy for that year amounting to &euro;480.11 million.  This proposed decision is available at:-</p><p><i></i>. Its final decision is due by 1st August 2020.  </p><p>More broadly, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market is solely a matter for the CRU, which was assigned this responsibility following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and subsequent legislation.  The CRU is solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions, including its functions relating to the pass through charges set out above, and not to the Minister. </p><p>As regard the pass through of the electricity tax, it is an excise duty charged on all supplies of electricity and levied within the framework of the EU Energy Tax Directive. It is accordingly entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance, and not the Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and Transport.</p></reply>

All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website <i>http://www.nbi.ie. </i></p><p>To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main NBP deployment. The BCP delivery project is well underway and surveying of the BCP locations is progressing which will facilitate detailed design and installation. BCP locations are subject to change and a number of the premises initially identified are in the process of being replaced with alternative locations. The remaining BCPs remain on track for delivery by the end of 2020.</p><p>Proposed BCP locations including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map (<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>). The BCPs in identified public places will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised.</p></reply>

This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products; local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched.

Under the European Commission&rsquo;s Next Generation EU package, published on 28 May, it is proposed that the budget for the EU Just Transition Fund would increase from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;40 billion over the period 2021 to 2027. The proposed allocations to all Member States would increase as a result, with that for Ireland increasing from &euro;29.9 million to &euro;176 million, subject to the outcome of negotiations on the MFF.</p>  <p>  The legislative proposal for the EU Just Transition Fund continues to be negotiated at EU level and Ireland is actively participating in these negotiations. </p>  <p>  Investments in Member States under the EU Just Transition Fund must be underpinned by a Territorial Just Transition Plan, covering the period 2021 to 2027, which must be approved by the European Commission and implemented within the framework of the EU&rsquo;s cohesion policy programmes. Work on this plan has commenced in my Department, and this work will also be supported by technical assistance under the European Commission&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme.</p>  <p>  Separately, the EU Platform for Coal and Other Carbon Intensive Regions in Transition, of which the Midlands Region is a member, works as an open forum, convening relevant local, regional and national governments, businesses and trade unions, NGOs and academia, to promote knowledge sharing and exchanges of experiences between EU coal and carbon-intensive regions to enable regions to identify and respond to their unique contexts and opportunities. </p>  <p>  While the Platform does not provide funding, membership enables regions to participate in multi-stakeholder dialogue on policy frameworks and financing for successful transformation of the included regions, to share best practice and to avail of support, in the form of technical assistance, for the development of strategies and projects for local regions, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation. The Platform was re-launched on 29 June as the Just Transition Platform. </p>  <p>  The Platform has been providing technical assistance to the Midlands Region, through its Secretariat Technical Assistance for Regions in Transition (START), to undertake a series of preparatory actions and engagements with communities during the course of 2020, including the registration of projects for potential funding under my Department&rsquo;s Just Transition Fund. The second stage of this call was launched by my Department on 19 June. Applications for funding must be received by 17 July and evaluations of submitted proposals will commence shortly afterwards.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). </p><p>The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset.  By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website<i>.</i>I understand that some of the premises referred to are close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network.  eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators, as to where they build infrastructure and provide services.</p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate the frustration of the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic and the individual circumstances referred to. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this commenced earlier this year. </p><p>To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main NBP deployment. The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. The BCP delivery project is well underway and surveying of the BCP locations is progressing which will facilitate detailed design and installation. BCP locations are subject to change and a number of the premises initially identified are in the process of being replaced with alternative locations. The remaining BCPs remain on track for delivery by the end of 2020. </p><p>The BCPs in identified public places will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised.</p></reply>

An interactive map showing ESB charger locations can be found at<i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i>.  The Government is investing, in a sustained way, in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure right across the country. The measures that have been put in place are providing significant support for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s charging network, both public and private. The Government is committed to increasing this network in the years to come so as to ensure good accessibility across a well-developed and modern charging network. </p><p>Already &euro;10 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund to assist the ESB in expanding their charging network and this has leveraged another &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: </p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW chargers), each capable of charging two vehicles </p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW charger), which may replace existing 22 kW chargers </p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW chargers) to more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points.</p><p>The fast charging infrastructure will be mainly concentrated on or near national roads and motorways to enable longer journeys to be completed. The first two multi charger sites have been delivered in Galway (M6) and Kildare (M9) with additional fast charger installation having already taken place in Dublin, Cavan, and Meath. Further plans are in place for a number of other sites in Galway, Kerry, Louth, Sligo and Westmeath.  </p><p>EV infrastructure will be deployed in a fundamentally different way compared to fossil fuel infrastructure. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of EV charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most is a convenient and cost-effective common and cheapest form of charging. The Government will seek to maintain this home charging level to 2030. On street charging will also be provided by Local Authorities (government supports already in place), and as the market develops, it will increasingly be provided by private enterprise also. </p><p>Managing this complex charging mix will require close cooperation across Central Government, Local Government and private enterprise. In this regard the Government will continue to review national charging needs, and will further develop its EV infrastructure accordingly with a view to ensuring that its policies promote a charging network that meets demand across both urban and rural locations.</p></reply>

All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website <i></i>.I understand that premises referred to the Question is very close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network.  eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators, as to where they build infrastructure and provide services.</p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts.

Operators who suspended their licences will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges facing businesses, the Government also put in place a range of measures to assist businesses during the current COVID-19 pandemic, including the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, the COVID-19 Restart Grant, and a waiver of commercial rates. Self-employed owner operators of SPSVs may also avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of &euro;350 a week that was introduced.</p>  <p>  At the present time, given the range of financial supports available, I do not see the need for additional supports for the SPSV industry. However, noting that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is scheduled to end on 10 August 2020, this question will be kept under continual review by Government. In addition, my Department is in regular contact with the NTA to monitor the impact the reopening of the economy in line with the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business is having on demand for SPSV services and to ensure that SPSV operators who have temporarily stopped working are well placed to return to work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.1854.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000081#WREE03800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 and 663 together.</p><p>Since the beginning of the Covid-19 health emergency, the Government has been clear that continued operation of the public transport sector is important and designated public transport as an &ldquo;essential service&rdquo; during the Covid-19 emergency, recognising the importance of keeping the system running especially for carrying essential workers and other passengers making necessary journeys throughout the crisis period. </p><p>The introduction of restrictions on public movement and the temporary closure of many workplaces, education centres and leisure and social activities across the country has led to an unprecedented fall in demand for public transport.  Nonetheless, public transport has served, and will continue to serve, a vital role in transporting essential workers and in supporting Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business in the weeks and months ahead.</p><p>While the majority of public transport in Ireland is provided by the publicly-subvented bus and rail services funded through National Transport Authority's (NTA) public service obligation (PSO) programme, the public transport system also includes non-subvented bus services provided on a commercial basis by bus and coach businesses of varying size. I understand that about 90% of the commercial bus operators have suspended their services or are providing significantly reduced services at present.</p><p>On the 25th of June, Government announced changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions. It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The Government also decided to legally require the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age (under 13).  These measures will protect both passengers and staff and significantly help ease the pressure on operators by reducing the gap between public transport supply and demand.</p><p>Further, on the 25th of June Government agreed new temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, will be introduced for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p><p>Furthermore, the Government previously introduced a &euro;12bn package of supports for impacted businesses of all sizes, which include: the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p><p>Concerning vehicle testing fees - the cost of a Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) is set by regulation 14 of the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Vehicle Testing) (No. 2) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 347/2013) as amended. I do not intend to make further amendments to this legislation at present.</p><p>Furthermore, there are no plans currently to amend motor tax legislation to provide for waivers from motor tax (vehicle licensing). I do wish to advise that there is a facility in place to declare a vehicle off the road.  The Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013, as amended, provides for a system of declaring vehicles off the road in advance for motor tax purposes. The declaration must be made in the last month of an existing motor tax disc or renewed in the last month of a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made online or in a motor tax office, using the following declaration <i></i></p><p>The declaration can be made for any number of calendar months between 3 and 12 months i.e. it cannot be made for a period of 1 or 2 months.  If a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.</p></reply>

It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The Government also decided to legally require the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age (under 13).  These measures will protect both passengers and staff and significantly help ease the pressure on operators by reducing the gap between public transport supply and demand.</p>  <p>  Further, on the 25th of June Government agreed new temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, will be introduced for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p></reply>

It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In support of this change, from the 29th of June it has also been made mandatory to wear a face covering when using public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age. These measures will significantly help ease the pressure on operators and reduce the gap between public transport supply and demand.</p></reply>

However, if a flight goes ahead and a customer either cancels or does not use their ticket, they are not entitled to a refund under EU law.  I understand, however, that the current practice of the two main Irish airlines serving the Irish market in instances where flights are not cancelled, and having regard to the Covid-19 travel restrictions, is to offer their customers the opportunity to rebook a flight for later in the year or to receive a voucher, without further charge.</p>  <p>  Clearly the existing consumer protections and legal obligations on airlines and the broader travel sector did not envisage the current circumstances of mass cancellations and stringent travel restrictions across the globe.  That has, not surprisingly, put the entire system under immense pressure and it is causing real difficulties for people and businesses.</p>  <p>  I am mindful that the options put forward by airlines may not be fair or workable for customers in all instances, and it is something that I will raise directly with the two main Irish airlines at the earliest opportunity.  In looking to the future recovery, seeking ways to rebuild consumer confidence will be integral to initiating and indeed sustaining any future recovery for all parts of the aviation sector including the airlines.</p></reply>

The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and to facilitate the timely sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding and response to the crisis. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also developed a COVID-19 Business Support Hub which offers a suite of targeted supports for tourism businesses including a series of webinars from experts in each field, as well as advice guides with detailed FAQs and templates where necessary.   </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, &lsquo;Ireland, make a break for it&rsquo;, to the tourism and hospitality industry last week and it has since gone live across all media this weekend. This is a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer. They have also launched a new COVID-19 Safety Charter initiative designed to boost public confidence in the safety of businesses as the tourism sector reopens from 29th June.   </p>  <p>  To assist tourism businesses reopening in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, F&aacute;ilte Ireland published guidelines for the tourism sector, prepared in consultation with the tourism industry and relevant authorities.  These guidelines are intended to assist tourism businesses meet requirements in line with the Return to Work Safely protocol and based on the latest health advice.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce was established on 20th May 2020. The purpose of the Taskforce is to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. A dedicated page has been set up on the Gov.ie website which gives regular updates on the status of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce and includes minutes from meetings and documention relating to the work of the Taskforce.

The policy outlines the circumstances and the employees who are permitted to work from home, along with the frequency and  the environment  under which e- working can be undertaken with the approval of  the individual employee's manager or Head of Function.</p>  <p>  However, due to the restrictions imposed in March in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, immediate adaptations to this policy were required as the majority of staff in my Department moved to working from home. The roadmap for reopening society and businesses is clear that remote working should continue for all those who can do so.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Government Departments on the development of guidelines to underpin these arrangements.  The further adaptation of my Department's working from home or e-working policy will take account of the experience with working from home in the context of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and any further principles or guidelines developed centrally.</p></reply>

It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The Government also decided to legally require the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age (under 13).  These measures will protect both passengers and staff and significantly help ease the pressure on operators by reducing the gap between public transport supply and demand.</p>  <p>  Further, on the 25th of June Government agreed new temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, will be introduced for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government previously introduced a &euro;12bn package of supports for impacted businesses of all sizes, which include: the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, a number of supports have been put in place to assist the sector in reopening.</p><p>I recently announced a major funding package to facilitate the reopening of ELC and SAC services from 29 June, including a<b></b>once-off capital grant of &euro;14.2M. All registered centre based services re-opening between 29 June and the beginning of September can avail of this grant.</p><p>This grant can be used by services to help them to adhere to the reopening guidelines by improving hygiene facilities and outdoor play areas. It should be noted that the definition of a capital asset is an asset intended for use on a continuing basis with an expected life of more than one year. Therefore capital grants cannot be used to purchase PPE and other consumable items.</p><p>There is a high level of flexibility being allowed in respect of the items that may be purchased, in recognition of the fact that services will have very different needs depending on factors such as what they already have, what age groups they cater to, and the physical layout of their premises. A list of eligible categories of items has been shared with ELC and SAC services.</p><p>In addition to capital, the package of supports includes a re-opening grant of &euro;18m to assist ELC and SAC services in meeting operational costs, including additional staffing costs. This may cover extra staff required to help with pick-up or drop-off times, or to provide cleaning to meet hygiene standards. ELC and SAC services will be required to verify that the reopening support payment has been used to cover additional costs. Any overheads that are additional costs associated with reopening can be assigned to this purpose.  </p><p>In addition the Revenue-operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is continuing for employees of ELC and SAC services that reopen on 29 June, which will continue to provide support with staffing costs. There is a variety of conditions relating to the TWSS.  Revenue update their guidance frequently and it is essential that services participating in the scheme are alert to these materials.  </p><p>In developing this funding model I recognise that a reduced number of children are likely to attend ELC and SAC services in the initial weeks of reopening. This necessitates a tailored model, which will allow providers to operate with potentially less parental income. It will also ensure that ELC and SAC providers will not have to charge higher fees than they did pre-COVID-19, even though the costs of providing ELC and SAC may increase in some circumstances. This will benefit parents and children returning to services.</p><p>This suite of measures will run from 29 June to 23 August. Further details on all of these measures have been made available in FAQs that have been distributed to all ELC and SAC services.</p><p>My Department will review the operation of these measures in July and will then make further arrangements for services normally reopening in late August/early September. I acknowledge that the Deputy makes specific reference to this September in her question, but through these supports my Department is responding to the immediate need to reopen ELC and SAC services, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. As the Deputy will be aware, this plan for a phased reopening is under continuous assessment with regard to wider developments as they unfold. DCYA will continue to analyse the needs of the sector in the context of the country&rsquo;s phased reopening going forward. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-06-30a.2121.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020063000085#WRJJ02000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 755 and 756 together.</p>  <p>  The information which my predecessor provided to the House on both 20 May and 03 June in response to parliamentary questions on the expected delivery of the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters by 26 June was correct and accurate. </p>  <p>  Notably, the receipt of an update from the Commission on the 03 June was signalled in the response of the same date. My predecessor indicated that the correspondence would need to be considered in conjunction with her then Government colleagues. In its short Seventh Interim Report, which was subsequently published on 12 June, the Commission says its final report is very close to completion but it had encountered delays as a direct result of Covid-19 restrictions. For this reason, the Commission requested an extension to complete its work in accordance with the provisions of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 12 June, the then Government agreed to amend the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference to provide for the extension sought. The final report is now due to be delivered on 30 October 2020 at the latest, and not six months as indicated by the Deputy in her question. </p>  <p>  In granting these extensions, the then Government considered that the public interest was best served by facilitating the Commission to produce an evidence based determination on what happened to vulnerable mothers and children in these institutions. The Commission has engaged with hundreds of former residents in its work and is attempting to comprehensively analyse information at a level beyond what has been possible to date.  In agreeing to another extension of time the priority was to safeguard this substantial work so that the independent Commission can comprehensively address these crucial questions and conclude matters as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the legislative framework.</p>  <p>  With regard to the nature of the guarantee sought by the Deputy, it is important to clarify that a Commission of Investigation is independent in the conduct of its investigations. It must of course operate within its terms of reference and the previous Government, in granting the extensions sought, had been satisfied that the Commission was using its best endeavours to conclude its report on this painful period in our history. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that when a Commission submits its final report there are a number of procedural matters which must be addressed before the relevant Minister could seek the approval of Government to publish the report. For this reason there will always be a time interval between receipt of such reports and the separate arrangements for their publication. </p>  <p>  I understand that many former residents and their families will have been deeply disappointed with the Commission's need for additional time. I know that they understand that this Commission is investigating personal and sensitive matters which happened over a period of more than 75 years. So there are multiple lines of inquiry being pursued in the course of this complex statutory investigation. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to use existing channels of communication to ensure that former residents, their families and supporters are the first to be know of any developments in respect of these matters. I share the wish of all interested parties to see the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matter to conclude its work as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of the childcare sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) was launched on April 15th.</p>  <p>  The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; </p>  <p>  - and to give Early Learning and Care Educators security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this, the TWSCS provides funding towards a portion of staff wages and a contribution towards services' overhead costs. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by childcare providers.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the importance of robust oversight of Exchequer funding. This includes ensuring that funds provided under the TWSCS are used for intended purposes: to meet employee pay costs in conjunction with the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and contribute towards ongoing overhead costs. As part of ensuring that the TWSCS is fully understood by participants, my Department and Pobal have provided extensive information on this scheme, including the administrative and verification requirements.</p>  <p>  A verification process, which will involve Pobal communicating with a sample of scheme participants to verify the use of the funding provided under the scheme, will commence in the coming weeks. Funding provided under the wage top up element of the scheme must be used towards payroll in line with the requirements of the scheme. Funding provided under the overhead element of the scheme must be used to meet ongoing overhead costs. Pay costs, capital costs, and costs not related to childcare are examples of non-eligible expenditure under this scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department will take a reasonable and supportive approach to assessing the use of funding provided to services in this difficult time. I hope that all participating providers will use the money provided under the scheme in the manner set out in the Funding Agreement. A wide variety of items qualify as eligible expenditure, and my Department's priority is to support services to reopen in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  I would also note there are supports available to improve the sustainability of services during normal times, and these remain available to services which may still be facing regular challenges on top of the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. </p></reply>

Over the last five Budgets investment in childcare has increased by 141%, which reflects the emphasis being placed on improving access to affordable, high quality services. A significant funding package is now available to support services, including school-age services, with reopening following Covid-19-related closures. The funding is expected to support the retention of capacity in the sector.</p>  <p>  Under the National Childcare Scheme which opened for online applications on 20th November 2019, school-age childcare services who are registered with Tusla are able to avail of subsidies under the new scheme. The Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Registration of School Age Services) Regulations 2018 came into force on 18th February, 2019, enabling school-age childcare services to register with Tusla and participate in the National Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  The number of early learning and care and school-age childcare places in Ireland has doubled over the last 5 years, assisted by an annual programme of capital grants. In 2019, grants of up to &euro;20,000 were available to school age childcare providers for the creation of new school age places where demand for these was clearly evidenced. In 2020 school-age services are able to avail of capital and reopening grants to support their reopening.</p>  <p>  My Department also works in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills to support access to school-age childcare places in the context of the inter-departmental Action Plan on School-Age Childcare. The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines to assist school authorities on how their premises might be utilised for school-age childcare and other activities where it can be facilitated by the school patron/trustees.</p></reply>

They can do so by completing a paper application form and returning by post. For information on how to apply by post, parents can contact the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm.</p><p>I would also note that parents who already hold a Public Services Card and a basic MyGovidID account can still create a MyGovID verified account, and thereby complete an online application for the National Childcare Scheme. Details on how to do this can be found by logging into a MyGovID basic account, available at .</p><p>As such it is open parent to apply at the any stage for an NCS award through online or offline means.  </p><p>Regarding the issue of backdating subsidies, it has always been communicated by my Department that subsidy awards are payable from the week they are claimed, and not the date of application. It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such, the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public monies and that the investment is following the child.</p><p>Further information and resources for parents are available at </p></reply>

This includes measures to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases, including Covid-19, within their service. </p><p>Expert guidance on the safe reopening of childcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, approved by the Expert Advisory Group of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May. The guidance recommends, amongst other measures, the use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model to restrict interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children. </p><p>Working in conjunction with the Health Surveillance Protection Centre, Tusla has also prepared and issued guidance and a self-assessment checklist to all registered providers to assist them with complying with their regulatory obligations in the safe reopening of their services in line with ongoing public health measures.</p><p>Regulatory inspections which had been suspended as a result of the recent public health restrictions, are due to recommence in early July. During the initial resumption of inspections, Tusla will assess the procedures put in place by providers to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in line with their self-assessment checklist. </p><p>Tusla will work with providers to address any identified non-compliance through the inspection process in the first instance. As statutory regulator, however, Tusla retains the power to escalate findings of non-compliance to enforcement actions where necessary, in order to safeguard the health, welfare and development of children in early years settings.</p><p>Any concerns regarding the operation of an early years service, including concerns about infection control measures, can be notified to the Unsolicited Information Office of Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate. All such concerns will be screened and assessed to determine if they fall within the remit of the Regulations. Such information will then be used to determine the focus and timing of inspections.

The decisions to be made are complex and must balance a number of important issues. </p>  <p>  Expert guidance on the safe reopening of childcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, approved by the Expert Advisory Group of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Friday, 29 May.  The guidance recommends use of a &ldquo;play pod&rdquo; model which restricts interactions between closed groups of children and adults as an alternative to social distancing, on the basis that social distancing is not possible between young children.</p>  <p>  Based on advice provided by the HPSC I do not propose to change Regulations in relation to either the adult-child ratios or the floor-space requirements for early learning and care services.  </p>  <p>  Services are asked to apply the guidance to their setting and determine what capacity they may offer. It is expected that a significant amount of capacity will be available in individual services when they reopen, subject to, for example, their space, room layout and staffing availability.  </p>  <p>  It must be noted that the Department is not the owner/employer of early learning and care services; they are private businesses and specific decisions on how to reopen are a matter for the individual service provider.</p>  <p>  In saying that, my Department is working closely with the sector to address the many questions that exist in relation to reopening of services, including the issues around capacity and how the ECCE pre-school programme will operate when it recommences.</p></reply>

Both have distinct functions, powers and methods of working. Tusla has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. If Tusla suspects that a crime has been committed and a child has been wilfully neglected or physically or sexually abused, it will formally notify AGS without delay.</p><p>Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it. This includes assessing retrospective or historic allegations of abuse with regard to potential current risks to children. The Minister or Department is not generally notified in relation to the details or outcomes of these assessments.</p><p>Unfortunately we are aware of many examples of organisations not upholding high standards of child protection in Ireland in the past. However, a number of policy and legislative improvements have been made to child protection standards in recent years. In particular, the Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures, including improving child protection arrangements in organisations providing services to children. </p><p>The Act places an obligation on providers of relevant services to keep children safe from harm, to carry out a risk assessment and to develop a Child Safeguarding Statement (CSS) that outlines the policies and procedures that are in place to manage any risks identified. The Act also provides for Tusla to establish and maintain a register of non-compliance for providers who fail to provide a copy of the CSS to Tusla when requested to do so. Tusla has established a Child Safeguarding Statement Compliance Unit (CSSCU) to support implementation of these provisions of the Act. The register of non-compliance is available on the Tusla website .</p><p>In addition, the Act provides for each Government Department to prepare a sectoral implementation plan which sets out the programme of measures either in place or planned to ensure compliance with Children First Guidance and legislation. The plans also apply to any organisation that provides a relevant service to children and receives funding from the relevant Department in that regard. </p><p>A request for any additional reviews of child protection measures in an organisation would depend on the circumstances involved and the governance relationships in place.</p></reply>

While the Roadmap initially  indicated that services would resume only for the children of essential workers, this has now been widened. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, as Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services are private businesses, and now that the Roadmap has extended eligibility for services, the allocation of places is a matter for the service provider. This guidance is provided to help support providers in managing allocation of places when services reopen in a situation where demand is greater than the supply available. </p>  <p>  In the best interests of the child and families, children should, as far as possible, be enabled to return to the service they attended Pre-COVID-19. Services availing of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) are contractually bound to retain places for families who used those places pre-COVID-19, until such time as the services reopen. There are significant benefits for children&rsquo;s wellbeing and development in maintaining the link with their pre-COVID-19 providers of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare.</p>  <p>  If a service has additional capacity, they may register new families who have not previously used the setting, either on a long-term or a short-term basis depending on the service's capacity. </p>  <p>  If capacity is limited, services are asked to prioritise the children of health and social care workers and other frontline workers, where possible. Services are also encouraged to support: </p>  <p>  - vulnerable children sponsored under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and children funded through legacy childcare schemes who are experiencing poverty, disadvantage or child welfare issues;</p>  <p>  - children with disabilities who previously attended part or full-time early learning and care, including those preparing to start school in September; and</p>  <p>  - children whose parents need access to childcare in order to return to work, including children of childcare practitioners.</p>  <p>  Childcare service providers are private enterprises and therefore if there is a dispute between the parents of a child and a childcare service provider, unfortunately my Department cannot directly intervene. I would recommend that the parents in question get in contact with the provider to resolve this issue in the first instance. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached then I would recommend that the parents contact their local County Childcare Committee who may be in a position to provide some support with this.</p></reply>

Judge Murphy confirmed that the Commission had been working remotely in an attempt to complete the report by the end of June. Although the final report is well advanced, Judge Murphy advised that delays had been incurred due to the inevitable logistical challenges related to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  At its meeting on Friday 12 June, the then Government agreed to amend the Commission&rsquo;s terms of reference to provide for the extension sought. The Commission's final report is now due to be submitted on 30 October 2020 at the latest.

The Government considers that the public interest is best served by facilitating the Commission to produce an evidence based determination on what happened to vulnerable mothers and children in these institutions.</p>  <p>  I know many former residents and their families are deeply disappointed with this delay.  However, I also know that they will understand the overwhelming impact which Covid-19 and the associated public health restrictions have had on all our lives.

Both pre-school and school-age services have for many years been able to take part in my Department's funding schemes, and both are included within the National Childcare Scheme. While regulations and minimum qualification requirements were introduced for pre-school services some years before their introduction for school-age services, school-age services are similarly on a journey of increasing support and progressive enhancements to quality requirements.</p>  <p>  Since the 31st December 2016, all employees of a pre-school service who work directly with children must hold a full, major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), or a qualification deemed equivalent by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. </p>  <p>  While initial Regulations for school-age childcare came into force in February 2019, those initial Regulations did not include a minimum qualification requirement for work in school-age childcare.</p>  <p>  First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, includes a commitment that by 2028 all regulated school-age childcare staff will hold a minimum qualification. </p>  <p>  The Workforce Development Plan, work on which began in mid-2019, has a number of objectives, including the identification of appropriate minimum qualification requirements for work in school-age childcare. A public consultation on school-age childcare, including on appropriate qualification requirements, was carried out in 2019. The public consultation included questions on whether different qualifications are required for practitioners working with pre-school and school-age children. Work on the Workforce Development Plan is ongoing.</p></reply>

They can do so by completing a paper application form and returning by post. For information on how to apply by post, parents can contact the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm.</p><p>I would also note that parents who already hold a Public Services Card and a basic MyGovidID account can still create a MyGovID verified account, and thereby complete an online application for the National Childcare Scheme. Details on how to do this can be found by logging into a MyGovID basic account, available at <i>www.mygovid.ie</i>.</p><p>As such it is open parent to apply at the any stage for an NCS award through online or offline means.  </p><p>Regarding the issue of backdating subsidies, it has always been communicated by my Department that subsidy awards are payable from the week they are claimed, and not the date of application. It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such, the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public monies and that the investment is following the child.</p><p>Further information and resources for parents are available at <i>www.ncs.gov.ie</i></p><p>The closure of Intreo offices has no impact on parents availing of other childcare subsidy supports, namely the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Training and Employment Childcare Scheme (TEC). Subsidies are available to any family who was registered in the childcare service on March 12th from when they return to the service.</p></reply>

The purpose of this financial review is to identify where legitimate savings are accruing due to shut downs or restrictions.</p>  <p>  I am aware that similar reviews are being undertaken across the public service and that a number of youth organisations have already undertaken or commenced such reviews.</p>  <p>  Specifically, my Department has asked that each youth organisation review its utilisation of State funding for 2020 to identify all instances where services are not being delivered for a period, or a reduced service is being delivered. In this context it is understood that many services are seeking to maintain full service delivery through alternate means and we have asked that this should be documented and detailed as part of this review. We are also aware that the phased resumption of full service provision may entail new costs associated with adhering to public health requirements and return to work protocols, and that these will need to be factored into any review of costs for the remainder of 2020.</p>  <p>  In the event that any organisation considers that it has either not utilised its full allocation to date, or will require less funding for the coming period, then we are asking them to reduce Quarter 3 drawdown requests accordingly.</p></reply>

This pilot programme is even more important in the COVID-19 operating environment and my Department has adopted a flexible approach to ensure that the scheme meets the new challenges facing the sector.  </p>  <p>  The Community Services Programme (CSP), currently supports over 400 social enterprises and community organisations and my Department is fully committed to continuing to support those organisations. My Department put in place a 2020 Support Fund which provided an additional payment to many of these organisations for a 12 week period from 26th March 2020, ensuring that they could pay their full-time CSP supported employees a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees.</p></reply>

For the first time, this has given the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test. When deciding to extend access to this benefit to the self-employed, Government wanted to ensure that it was on a similar basis to that of those in employment.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.</p><p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and for no other reason and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.  To qualify for IP a claimant must, inter-alia, have at least 260 (5 years) paid PRSI contributions since entering social insurance and 48 contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete contribution year before the relevant date of their claim.  Only PRSI classes A, E, H or S contributions are reckonable for IP purposes.  Class S contributions are those paid by self-employed people.</p><p>A claimant must be regarded as permanently incapable of work, which is defined as:</p><p>incapacity for work of such a nature that the likelihood is that the claimant will be incapable of work for life </p><p>OR</p><p>an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim, and where the Deciding Officer or an Appeals Officer is satisfied that the claimant is likely to be unable to work for 1 year from the date of claim.</p><p>A person in receipt of IP cannot engage in work. However, with prior written permission from the Department, a person may undertake light work for which no remuneration is or would ordinarily be payable.  Should a person in receipt of IP wish to take up or resume open labour market employment, they may qualify for Partial Capacity Benefit, a social welfare scheme which allows a person to return to work or self-employment (if they have reduced capacity to work) and continue to receive a payment from the Department.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

If he has a particular case in mind or if there are particular circumstances which he would like to bring to my attention, the matter can be fully investigated by my Department.</p></reply>

The annual grant of &euro;1,700 is available to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  This award can be used for any purpose at the discretion of the carer and it is not taxed.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention to someone who requires that level of care are also eligible and can apply for a grant.</p>  <p>  On Thursday 4 June, 125,000 grants were paid automatically to 114,000 people receiving Carer's Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Some 11,000 carers who are providing care for two or more people received a grant in respect of each person they are caring for.  The grant is paid in respect of each person being cared for to take account of the additional cost of providing care and to recognise the particular challenges faced by these carers. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that payments made by my Department are set out in legislation or administrative guidelines.  There is no provision to make the type of payment outlined by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Finally, I  have no plans to introduce additional income supports for carers at this time.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and the particular challenges they face in light of Covid-19 and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The legislative provisions are supplemented by planning guidelines entitled the Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structure Guidelines, which originally issued to planning authorities in 1996. In 2012, my Department issued Circular Letter PL07/12 to planning authorities, updating certain sections of these Guidelines. The Guidelines provide advice on appropriate location and siting considerations for telecommunication installations and masts to be considered in the development planning and development management process. The Guidelines, and subsequent Circular Letter, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: </p><p><i></i></p><p>and</p><p><i></i></p><p>In making decisions on a planning application, a planning authority, or the Board as appropriate, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department.  Public participation is a crucial element of all substantive decision-making processes under the Act, and is also a requirement under the UN Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation on Decision Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention) and the European Union Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011/92/EU, as amended, in relation to specific types of developments.</p><p>The right to appeal is a fundamental aspect of the planning system. An applicant, or anyone who has made a submission or observation in relation to a planning application, may apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to appeal a decision made by a planning authority in respect of an application for permission.  In making decisions in respect of a planning appeal, the Board is required to consider the same matters as the local planning authority did in its consideration of the original planning application and will then reach its own conclusions in relation to the application.</p><p>Under section 30 of the Act, I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la is or may be concerned, except in specific circumstances which do not apply in this case.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the making of Building Regulations and Building Control Regulations.</p><p>The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements in Ireland for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings. The related Technical Guidance Documents (Parts A - M) provide technical guidance on practical compliance with the regulations.  </p><p>Technical Guidance Documents are free to view/download on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The Building Regulations (Part K Amendment) 2014, came into effect on 1 January 2015 and was accompanied by Technical Guidance Document K (2014). Section 2.7 of Technical Guidance Document K provides that in dwellings where a window has an opening section through which a person may fall, (having particular regard to children under five years of age), and is more than 1400 mm above external ground level, suitable safety restrictors should be provided. The Building Regulations, including Part K requirements, are subject to ongoing review. </p><p>Safety restrictors should restrain the window sufficiently to prevent such falls. Restrictors can be either an integral part of the window operating gear or separate items of hardware which can be fitted to a window at the time of manufacture or at installation. Restrictors should operate so that they limit the initial movement of an opening section to not more than 100 mm. </p><p>In relation to products, Part D of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for materials and workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo; which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations. </p><p>Under the Construction Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC) (CPR), manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product (which is covered by harmonised European standards or European Technical Assessments) on the EU market, to make a Declaration of Performance and affix the CE mark. </p><p>In broad terms, this means that manufacturers are required to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products. For many construction products, the application of the CE mark will require the involvement of a third party (known as a &lsquo;notified body&rsquo;) to undertake certain tasks as specified in the harmonised European standard.  These tasks can include intial type-testing of products, inspection of factory production control and surveillance of factory production control.  </p><p>Windows in which restrictors are an integral part of the window operating gear are covered by harmonised European standards and therefore must comply with the CPR.</p><p>Window restrictors which are on sale as separate items of hardware which can be fitted to a window after manufacture are not covered by harmonised European standards and therefore do not fall under the CPR. Such products (which do not require a CE mark) must however comply with General Product Safety Regulations to ensure that they are safe. This is the responsibility of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the General Product Safety Regulations come  under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>It is important, to note that in the first instance, it is a matter for owners, designers and builders, with responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulation, to specify the particular project specific performance requirements of products in the context of the conditions in which they are to be used. </p><p>In addition, during construction such steps as are necessary should be taken to ensure that the products provided meet these specifications and are suitable for the purpose for which they are intended. Guidance is provided in relation to this in the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, which is available at the following link: </p><p><i></i></p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for each of the 31 local building control authorities that are independent in the performance of their statutory duties. Building control authorities are also designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR. In both cases  authorities have a range of enforcement powers. </p><p>In terms of rental housing properties, all landlords have a legal duty to ensure that their rented properties comply with certain minimum physical standards. These minimum standards are set out in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 201, which provide that suitable safety restrictors must be fitted to windows through which a person could fall.</p></reply>

Local authorities have been advised to capture all related costs in their financial systems to aid future financial analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the Sector.</p>  <p>  At the outset and to minimise cash flow challenges, my Department arranged for the early payment of Local Property Tax (LPT) to all local authorities.  As a short term measure, &euro;136m was made available to local authorities as cash flow support in early April, in order to ensure that vital services that local authorities deliver can be maintained.  This support was comprised of the early payment of the LPT allocation ordinarily paid from the Local Government Fund in May and July. Further to these measures, my Department recently arranged for the early payment of 50% of each local authority&rsquo;s individual Payroll and PSPR allocation, amounting to &euro;54.8m. This interim payment would ordinarily be paid later in July.</p>  <p>  On 2 May 2020, a waiver of commercial rates was announced to all businesses that have been forced to close due to public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. The costs involved to be met by the Exchequer. The approved Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, commits to setting out how commercial rates will be treated for the remainder of 2020, as a priority action for the new Government.</p>  <p>  In order to support the local government sector generally, I will ensure that my Department will continue to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow generally under review and will continue to work with all local authorities, both collectively and individually, on issues arising.</p></reply>

There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration. </p>  <p>  From a legislative perspective, this includes for example,  </p>  <p>  - the Derelict Sites Act 1990, which imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site;</p>  <p>  - the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, and provides for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use. This measure is aimed at facilitating the productive re-use of qualifying vacant commercial buildings as homes, while also facilitating urban renewal and the bringing on stream of increased housing supply;</p>  <p>  - the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, under which planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019. The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020; and</p>  <p>  - local authorities also have compulsory purchase order powers which can be used in certain circumstances to address these issues. </p>  <p>  From a funding perspective, significant resourcing is being provided to enhance the urban environment of our cities, towns and villages through the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund established under Project Ireland 2040: The National Development Plan.  The URDF, which is the fund operated by my Department, was launched in 2018 and has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.   The URDF was established to support applicant-led projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and the NDP. The aim is to achieve more compact,  sustainable and mixed use development, with a view to ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit. This will be done by supporting proposals that contribute to the re-development of key brownfield areas, including areas containing derelict sites and buildings, both by enabling infrastructure and new master-planned development proposals.  88 projects across the breadth of the country have been approved for URDF support thus far.  A second call for proposals was launched in January of this year.  The closing date for applications was 29 May 2020 and these applications are now being assessed. </p>  <p>  Under the National Vacant Home Reuse Strategy 2018-21, the Vacant Homes Unit in my Department has, since 2018, provided annual funding of &euro;50,000 to each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. Each such office is tasked to support, implement and further develop, update, monitor and review the progress of local authorities&rsquo; Vacant Homes Action Plans and actions to address vacant private housing; in addition to other core functions to identify and bring back vacant homes into use.  In addition, under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, two schemes were introduced to assist in bringing vacant stock back into use.</p>  <p>  - the Repair and Leasing Scheme introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.</p>  <p>  - the Buy and Renew Scheme introduced to support local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use.  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of vacant properties.  </p>  <p>  The regeneration of our towns and villages will remain an important component of urban policy and the Programme for Government in committing to the continuation of the URDF and RRDF, also proposes the bringing forward of an expanded town and village renewal scheme to bring vacant and derelict building back into use and promote residential occupancy.</p></reply>

My Department is conducting a piece of research on the potential accumulation of rent arrears during the emergency period in conjunction with the ESRI as part of the established Department/ESRI housing research programme.  The research will have regard to the range of rental and income supports being made available to those affected by COVID-19, and will assess the combined impact that these supports together with the changed consumption patterns have on the incidence of arrears.</p><p>My Department recently published a Guidance Document on COVID-19 supports for landlords and tenants, which sets out the emergency rental measures and income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during the emergency period.The Guidance document is available at: </p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/COVID_Update_Guidance_Document_final.pdf </i></p><p>and a list of Frequently Asked Questions has been developed and is available at:</p><p><i>https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/images/uploads/Comms%20and%20Research/FAQs_on_Emergency_Legislation_Final.pdf </i></p><p>The RTB is encouraging all customers who may require assistance or advice, including in relation to any threatened eviction, to contact them via their web chat service as there may be delays to their phone lines during the emergency period. The webchat service can be accessed at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, a tenant sources their own accommodation in the private rented market. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended.  HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections as all private rented tenancies.  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p><p>Where HAP tenants are not financially impacted by the COVID-19 measures, they are expected to continue to pay their HAP differential rent.  However, if tenants&rsquo; circumstances change, the local authority should reassess those tenants and adjust their differential rent accordingly. Local authorities have been requested to ensure that HAP tenants newly in receipt of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) supports be facilitated in remaining in their HAP tenancies. If amendments cannot be made immediately to a tenant&rsquo;s differential rent amount, any arrears accumulating from the date of approval of the new DEASP support should be rectified at a later date.This will not affect the HAP payment to the landlord.</p><p>The DEASP Rent Supplement scheme continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme currently supporting approximately 21,200 recipients. The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme ensures that renters experiencing a temporary loss of employment during the COVID-19 emergency can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Since the introduction of the former Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 emergency response approximately, 6,700 customers have been provided Rent Supplement support; in addition, there are currently, approximately, 1,100 pending applications awaiting a decision or in the process of providing the necessary documentation to the officer dealing with their claim. The DEASP response to the COVID-19 emergency has ensured the flexibility of the Rent Supplement scheme via specific measures to prevent undue delays in processing applications despite the large number of new cases received over a relatively short timeframe. The 2/3 day turnaround of applications ensures that customers do not build up rent arrears and officers attempt to ensure that a person's rental obligations are met in full.</p><p>The DEASP Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by providing assistance to those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.  There are several payments within the scheme including once-off exceptional needs payments (ENPs) which can cover rent arrears.</p><p>Where a person has a change of circumstances, such as a loss of income, they should notify the relevant local authority in the case of a HAP claim, or the DEASP for Rent Supplement to assess the level of any payment that can be made.</p></reply>

The nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby.</p>  <p>  My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels &ndash; which are equivalent to an A2 Building Energy Rating (BER) for a typical dwelling. </p>  <p>  The performance requirements in building regulations are set at the cost optimal level which ensure that the best energy performance is obtained for the lowest lifecycle cost taking account of capital cost and operating costs. The cost optimal calculations are reviewed every 5 years.</p>  <p>  A range of solutions can be used to achieve these performance requirements. The advanced performance requirements in the current regulations combined with a mandatory renewables requirement, is creating a rapid transition to low carbon heating systems in all new dwellings.  New social housing is subject to these same requirements.</p>  <p>  Builders and homeowners have a choice in deciding which energy system best suits their needs. The regulations encourage the use of renewable technologies and the move away from traditional fossil fuels.  This strategy is working based on CSO statistics&ndash; the installation of oil boilers has dropped from 36% to 4% in new dwellings.  Electrical heating systems which are primarily heat pumps has increased to 44% in new dwellings in recent years and continue to increase their market share every quarter. There are no statistics available on the percentage of new social housing specifically that have a heat pump however it is expected that it would follow the national trend for all new dwellings.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 Part L regulations requires 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  This shows the very significant progress that has already been made in the standards for new buildings.</p></reply>

As such, and in the case of dwellings that any housing authority is advertising for sale under the affordable purchase scheme, it will be possible for the authority to express eligibility as a simple income limit in each case.  </p>  <p>  If the household's repayment on a mortgage for a suitable dwelling would not exceed 35% of net household income, then that household would not be deemed eligible to apply for an affordable home under the scheme. </p>  <p>  Further Regulations are currently being drafted under Part 5 to prescribe a definition of income and the interest rate and mortgage duration to be used in making the above calculation.  When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p></reply>

Among these the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment operates a number of support packages available for all businesses including the sectors referred to by the Deputy.  Measures have been developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need, and at vulnerable but viable companies.  In parallel, the Revenue Commissioners operate the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme which has been extended to 31 August, while the Department of Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands operates the Pandemic Unemployment Payment extended until 10 August.  These supports are available to businesses and workers in the events industry and in the school transport system.Full details on these COVID-19 supports are available at the following links</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>My Department  has responsibility for initiatives specific to the tourism sector and events and festivals.  To this end,  a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was set up  to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period 2020-2023.  Full details including updates may be accessed at this link <i></i></p><p>There are also two jobseekers benefit schemes are in place for the self-employed as well as the Social Welfare Scheme for Self-Employed Artists. The latter scheme recognises the unique creative circumstances of artists in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance and gives them special assistance in their first year out of work, allowing them to focus on their creative output. Further detail of these schemes can be accessed at the following link  <i></i></p><p>On 16 June a significant investment of &euro;25 million in Arts and Culture in 2020 was announced byGovernment  to help the Arts and Culture sector recover from the Covid19 Emergency in 2020.  The funding will include bursaries and commissions to artists and arts organisations, and resources for museums and culture workers as they prepare for the re-opening of society. This is additional to funding previously allocated to the sector.</p><p>A total of &euro;20 million will be allocated to the Arts Council bringing its allocation this year to &euro;100 million.  A further &euro;5 million will be available for other measures, including securing the future of key cultural and museum spaces and facilities throughout Ireland, and the production of high-quality digital art and on-line performances.</p><p>Also on 16 June, it was announced that the Department of an Taoiseach and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would convene a meeting of relevant representatives from the public and private sector to discuss how to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid19 recovery and beyond, recognising that the issues faced by venues as well as artists in an era where mass gatherings are restricted, are unique and will be problematic for quite some time.  That process of engagement is now underway. </p></reply>

This consultation paper set out information on services that are currently being provided to the islands which would form the basis for the consultation process.</p><p>Since January this year, officials of my Department arranged a series of consultation meetings to provide island communities the opportunity to offer their views and opinions on a future islands policy and to discuss island necessities. </p><p>To date, meetings have taken place on eleven islands as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Islands</th>       <th>Date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sherkin</td>       <td>9 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Whiddy</td>       <td>10 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dursey</td>       <td>10 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bere Island</td>       <td>17 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inis O&iacute;rr</td>       <td>22 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inis M&oacute;r</td>       <td>29 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inis Me&aacute;in </td>       <td>30 January 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Heir</td>       <td>7 February 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Long</td>       <td>7 February 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cl&eacute;ire</td>       <td>7 February 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&Aacute;rainn Mh&oacute;r</td>       <td>13 February 2020</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The public consultation element of the process has had to be temporarily postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The next step in the process will be to arrange meetings on the remaining islands and with relevant stakeholders, including state bodies who provide services to the islands. Once this aspect of the work has been completed, it is intended that the new Islands Policy will be agreed by Government and published, following on from which an action plan based on the policy will be developed.</p><p>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that this work has been identified as a priority in the recently agreed Programme for Government. </p></reply>

Under the terms of the scheme, the Department provides a subsidy worth &euro;10 per day (equivalent to &euro; 220 per student for a three week course) which benefits over 26,000 students a year while staying in any of the c.700 households throughout the Gaeltacht which are recognised under the scheme. This represents a State investment of over &euro;4m annually in the Irish summer colleges sector, which forms a critical part of the Gaeltacht economy and is estimated to be worth &euro;50m annually.</p><p>In addition to providing and administering this practical assistance, the Department also administers three separate funds under the scheme, for the benefit of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, namely:</p><p>- DEIS Gaeltachta &ndash; Under this measure which commenced in 2019, 50 scholarships are offered annually worth c. &euro;850 each to provide the opportunity for attendees of DEIS post-primary schools throughout the country to attend recognised summer colleges in Gaeltacht regions.</p><p>- ERASMUS Gaeltachta &ndash; Under this initiative which commenced in 2019 an annual fund worth &euro;250,000 has been created to give up to 175 third-level students the opportunity to spend a semester residing with accredited Gaeltacht households.</p><p>- &Aacute;rainn Gaeltachta &ndash; This initiative provides funding of up to &euro;150,000 over a 3-year period so that up to 30 post-primary students per year can spend a full year attending any one of the three post-primary schools on the Aran islands.</p><p>Needless to say, my Department continues to keep under constant review how best to further support and develop the sector within available resources and in a way which best supports the overall objectives of the overarching 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and in turn, the Irish language and Gaeltacht regions.</p></reply>
