With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to higher value added product development.</p>  <p>  These projections relate primarily to increasing the added-value of agrifood exports. </p>  <p>   Market development &ndash; developing new markets and growing existing markets, based on market insights &ndash; is one of the five themes of Food Wise, along with environmental sustainability, competitiveness, innovation and human capital. Obviously market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the sector.</p>  <p>  In April 2017 I launched a seven point action plan on market access. This is being implemented through a variety of actions, including:</p>  <p>  - a market prioritisation exercise and subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of my Department. On meat the five countries selected for detailed study were: Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico &amp;amp; Malaysia; and for dairy: Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia &amp;amp; Vietnam.</p>  <p>  - A market access web portal launched in May 2018, and available on my Department&rsquo;s website provides a wide range of valuable information to exporters.</p>  <p>  Trying to gain new market access, or enhance and improve existing market access has been a particularly prominent feature of recent Ministerial Trade Missions led by myself and my colleague Andrew Doyle. Trade missions over the last two years have focused on key growth markets:</p>  <p>  - Asia &ndash; China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia;</p>  <p>  - North America &ndash; USA, Mexico and Canada;</p>  <p>  - as well as the Gulf States and Turkey. </p>  <p>  In 2018 a number of additional markets were opened by my Department including the Chinese beef market, which was successfully opened after ongoing work over a number of years, as well as beef, sheepmeat and poultry markets in Kuwait and Qatar.</p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote in 2016, I have allocated significant additional funding for Bord Bia, as a key part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to support the sector in responding to Brexit uncertainty.   In Estimates 2019, I provided a further allocation of &euro;5.3 million to Bord Bia, bringing its total grant in aid to &euro;46.6 million for 2019.  This compares to a grant of &euro;28.9 million in 2014, and represents a 60% increase in funding for marketing and promotion of our food offering over five years.  Bord Bia also received approval last year to recruit an additional 32 staff, which will bring total staff numbers to 146 in 2019.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I secured &euro;20 million for a new Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. This Pilot complements the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), an agri-environmental measure specifically targeted at improving the genetic merit of the suckler herd, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period.</p>  <p>  All of these efforts are aimed at adding value all along the supply chain, supporting the agrifood sector as the most important indigenous sector, providing employment and supporting communities throughout rural Ireland.</p></reply>

This is to aid control and compliance and to deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity. </p><p>There are currently two Irish ports that have been designated for landings by vessels from a third country: Killybegs in Donegal and Castletownbere in Cork. </p><p>When the UK formally becomes a third country and the Common Fisheries Policy no longer applies to it, UK registered vessels will be restricted to landing fish at those two ports. The vast majority of current UK fish landings are to those ports. </p><p>However, if, as I very much hope will be the case, the Withdrawal Agreement is concluded, a transition period will apply where there will be no change to current practices for Irish or UK vessels for at least 2 years. </p><p>If, in the worst case scenario, no agreement is reached and there is a disorderly Brexit, then the UK will leave on the 29<sup>th</sup>of March 2019.  In that scenario, UK vessels would be restricted to landing in the two designated ports only from that date.</p></reply>

The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department has carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, to establish the potential volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This exercise has been used to guide our planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required. </p>  <p>  In general, regarding staffing requirements, my Department will look to use a combination of options including recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary.  My Department is working with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service to engage Veterinary Inspectors, Portal Inspectors, Plant Health Inspectors and Administrative support staff.  Mechanisms to temporarily redeploy experienced people within my Department have also been initiated and the engagement of contracted temporary service arrangements is also being progressed. </p>  <p>  The final staffing numbers to be engaged in response to Brexit contingencies will depend on the nature of Brexit and the trading relationship with the UK that ensues. Should a hard Brexit be confirmed as the probable contingency to be addressed, my Department, through the mechanisms I have outlined, will have scope to deploy appropriate levels of resources as may be required. Overall, I remain confident that both the state, and my Department, will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time, be that at the end of March or any other point in the future.</p></reply>

These measures not only focus on the mitigation of greenhouse gases and improving resource efficiency but are also aimed at restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems related to building resilience of agricultural production systems (i.e. adaptation).</p><p>The long term vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. Our policy approach is based on three principles:</p><p>i. reducing agricultural emissions ;</p><p>ii. increasing carbon sequestration; and</p><p>iii. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. </p><p>There are  a significant number of measures already in place which support these principles. However, I am not complacent on this important issue and my Department continues to review and develop new measures that will realise the ambition for the sector.</p><p>An All-of-Government Plan to tackle climate disruption, which my colleague the Minister for Communication, Climate Action and Energy is currently leading on, will build on the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan and identify additional actions so as to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.</p><p>I will continue to work with my government colleagues to ensure the successful delivery of this plan and commit to measures and actions that will support our approach to carbon neutrality without compromising capacity for sustainable food production.</p><p>While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland's climate change and energy targets in the years ahead</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-06a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020600069#WRA01900"><p>My efforts to improve the position of beef farmers and to protect the sector from Brexit have been focused on improving the sector's competitiveness and its ability to diversify markets in order to reduce exposure to the UK market. </p><p>The measures I have introduced include a &euro;150m low-cost loan scheme in 2017 to help reduce farm-gate business costs, and a dedicated &euro;50m Brexit package in Budget 2018 which included further additional funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc as well as a contribution to a &euro;300m (joint DAFM/DBEI) &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, at least 40% of which is available to food businesses. In Budget 2019 I announced a &euro;78m Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit. My colleague, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, also announced the Future Growth Loan Scheme,<b></b>which will be rolled out in 2019 and for which I had made provision of &euro;25m in 2018. The scheme will provide long term, unsecured investment finance for farmers and small scale companies in the food and seafood sectors.</p><p>On market and product diversification, the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia has been used, inter alia, to provide targeted advice to individual companies as well as to conduct a market prioritisation exercise which is now informing our approach to market diversification activities, including the choice of destinations for Trade Missions. </p><p>Trade Missions play an important role in this regard, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia 2018. These missions included participants from across the agrifood sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  These and the other missions that my Department has under consideration for 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations. Indeed, since the UK referendum I have increased Bord Bia&rsquo;s funding by a total of &euro;19.5 million, including a further &euro;5 million allocated in Budget 2019. </p><p>Product diversification has also been supported through additional funding of &euro;8.8 million to Teagasc to develop its National Food Innovation Hub, and funding to support investment in the prepared consumer foods sector. </p><p>I and my officials have also been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish beef and other sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p><p>Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan last week to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit. We discussed the unique exposure of sectors such as the beef sector to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. </p><p>I have also met with the chief executives of all of the major British retailers to impress upon them the commitment of Irish suppliers in continuing to supply the UK market post-Brexit. </p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agrifood industry, including the beef industry, through the challenges ahead.</p></reply>

Expenditure to date amounts to over &euro;109m with over &euro;5.6m issuing last December and a further &euro;7.3m issuing in January just gone. </p>  <p>  My Department is closely monitoring expenditure, including expired approvals, under the scheme. By the end of 2018 approvals had expired with a grant value of approximately &euro;11.8m - this appears to be the figure referred to in the question raised. However, I should point out that to date a total of 18,317 approvals have issued with a total estimated grant value of over &euro;276m.  All of these cases represent committed expenditure under the TAMS II measure of the RDP. Until such time as issued approvals are acted upon and payment claims submitted or approvals expire the budget for TAMS must include provision for the potential expenditure involved. I have also committed to keeping the scheme open for applications until end-2020 and must retain budget to allow this to happen in the interests of fairness to current and future applicants.  It is anticipated that, based on the number of applications and payment claims being received, the full allocation of &euro;395m will be spent over the course of the RDP. It must also be remembered that TAMs is only one scheme under our overall Rural Development Programme which as things stand is projected to overspend by &euro;105m.</p>  <p>   I have recently introduced changes to the Scheme, with meal bins now added to the long list of eligible investment items for all sectors under the Scheme and a favourable revision of the penalties applied for the late submission of payment claims. The Scheme also remains open for new applications with the current tranche due to close on 5 April this year. Applications continue to be received and processed under the Scheme with approvals currently issuing to the over 2,000 farmers who submitted applications under the tranche that closed on 7 December 2018. I am pleased to note that the level of applications received shows that there is an increasing level of interest in the Scheme. I would urge all participants who have completed approved works to submit their payment claims immediately to facilitate early payment.</p></reply>

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers.  My Department facilitates this trade, recognising its critical importance to the agri sector, while ensuring that live animal exports meet the highest welfare standards.</p>  <p>  Live exports of cattle increased by 30% over 2017, to 246,000 head.  This change was driven by a significant increase in exports to other EU countries.  Calf exports increased significantly. In 2017 I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under 3 months of age from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 - this has brought greater equity to the inspection fee regime.  Calf exports to Spain increased by 66%, to over 72,500 head in 2018. Exports of Irish calves to Italy and the Netherlands also increased last year, to over 12,500 and 48,500 head, respectively. Calf exports to Belgium and France increased from 4,200 to 13,000 head and from 2,500 to 8,500 head, from 2017 to 2018 respectively.  Exports to third countries decreased in 2018 &ndash; due in part to currency fluctuations in the Turkish Lira.  Nevertheless, nearly 13,000 head of cattle were exported to Turkey last year.</p>  <p>  In the first three weeks of this year live exports came to 3,500, up from 1,400 in the same period in 2018. Northern Ireland and Spain have been the largest markets for live exports so far in 2019, with 1,200 and 1,600 head of cattle, respectively.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with third countries and to seek out new markets for live exports.  New health certs for the export of cattle to Libya were agreed in November 2018, which increase the range of cattle that can be exported there.  My Department is engaged with Egypt to secure the finalisation of agreement on three proposed health certs for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle.</p></reply>

With regard to employment, Food Wise foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agri-food sector all along the supply chain from primary production to higher value added product development.</p>  <p>  These projections relate primarily to increasing the added-value of agri-food exports. Furthermore, the direct payments in Ireland have been decoupled from productions so now the payment is no longer contingent on the number of animals retained.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a comparative advantage in grass-based carbon efficient livestock production. The EU Commission JRC report (2010) found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer in the EU per unit of dairy production, and the 5th most carbon efficient producer of beef per kg. Government efforts are focused on driving towards even greater carbon efficiency through Origin Green Quality Assurance Schemes, and schemes such as BDGP and BEEP, as well as knowledge transfer.</p>  <p>  My Department is pursuing a policy of ensuring that supports to the beef sector explicitly support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve both the economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system. The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is improving the environmental sustainability by increasing genetic merit within the suckler beef herd.  I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP),  a &euro;20 million pilot scheme specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production from the suckler herd, by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves. </p>  <p>  On the dairy side, Dairy Sustainability Ireland (DSI) is a collaborative initiative established to help farmers meet environmental targets, improve profitability and copper fasten Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a world leader in grass-fed dairy production. This work has in turn contributed to the development of the Agricultural Sustainability Support &amp;amp; Advisory Programme, a collaborative initiative to facilitate improvements in water quality. </p>  <p>  While we are making progress, there is no room for complacency &ndash; the agri-food sector must continue to make improvements in terms of sustainability and environmental performance. Collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility are necessary to meet the challenges that are facing us. I am convinced that we must all work together to ensure that the sector continues to play its part in meeting our climate obligations and challenges.</p></reply>

Under EU law, dogs moved to another EU country from Ireland must be accompanied by an EU pet passport, be microchipped, and have a valid rabies vaccination.  </p>  <p>  The welfare of greyhounds is regulated by the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the Animal Health and Welfare Act of 2013.  The latter applies to all animals, whether kept for commercial, domestic, sport, show or other purposes.  It contains robust measures against the ill-treatment of animals. </p>  <p>  The Greyhound Racing Bill 2018, when enacted, will add to existing legislation, making the greyhound the most regulated of all canine breeds in Ireland. The Bill ensures that the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously laid down in primary legislation.  In broad terms the Bill seeks to address deficiencies in the existing legislation and the governance of Bord na gCon.  It will strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. </p>  <p>  My Department has a close working relationship with animal welfare charities on all aspects of animal welfare.

The current programme expires at the end of 2020. Publicly funded afforestation has been a central part of Government policy for many years now given the many benefits which forestry presents, not least for our rural economy and for the environment and climate policies.</p>  <p>  The supports available were reviewed as part of the Mid-Term Review of the programme, which concluded in 2018. Following the review a 7% increase in grant and 5% increase in premium rates were introduced for broadleaf planting categories. Increased rates for Agro forestry and forestry for fibre categories were also introduced. In addition the minimum mandatory requirement  for broadleaf planting per site was increased from 10% to 15%, with a resultant increase in the percentage planted in 2018 to 27%, up from 21% in 2017. My Department has also introduced the first ever continuous cover forestry scheme in Ireland this month as part of a suite of biodiversity related measures in order to give landowners more options when it comes to felling. </p>  <p>  It's worth noting that all forests have an important role in climate action through the removal and storage of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and by supplying sustainable and renewable materials that support the decarbonisation of our economy. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation covering the period 2021 to 2030, Ireland has the ability to account up to 26.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide removals by the land use sector towards our emission reduction targets. Removals of greenhouse gases by afforested land are forecast to amount to 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over this period.  </p>  <p>  As regards Co. Leitrim, my colleague Minister Andrew Doyle announced a study last week.  This evidence-based review will assess the impacts of forestry in the county, both positive and negative and will help to inform both the local community and Government policy on forestry, rural development and land use.</p></reply>

This equates to a cut of approximately 5% to the CAP budget in the next MFF period of 2021 - 2027.  I have previously stated that the proposed cut is unacceptable for Ireland.</p>  <p>   Negotiations on the MFF proposals have commenced and are running in parallel to the CAP post 2020 negotiations. The European Commission's intention is to reach overall agreement on the MFF before the European Parliamentary elections in 2019.  </p>  <p>   The MFF is a critical matter for all Member States and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear that there are divergent views among member states on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some Member States (including Ireland) have indicated their willingness to increase their contributions, once they contribute towards areas of added European value, there are others who feel equally strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  </p>  <p>   The departure of the UK from the EU further compounds the budgetary issue, with some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK nett contributions being removed from the budget post 2020.  Against this background, agreeing the MFF will make these negotiations a particularly challenging task.</p>  <p>   I have been working to build consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget. I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid in May last year, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post 2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.  We will continue to work together on this issue as the negotiations for the CAP post 2020 and its budgetary allocations progress.</p>  <p>  I have also sought to continue this work as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, my colleague Minister Doyle and I have met initially with the EU Agri Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary, inter alia to support a strong CAP Budget after 2020. I have also met with Ministers from the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg, and Austria, and my officials engage regularly with counterparts in other member states on this issue. </p>  <p>  Ireland needs to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to reverse the proposed cuts in CAP. I would like to reassure the deputy that I will continue to do this, and to fight for a strong CAP budget as the negotiations progress.</p></reply>

Having an agreed health cert for breeding cattle provides much more clarity for exporters, as previously exports of breeding cattle to Libya had to be agreed on a load by load basis.  The age of cattle that can be exported to Libya increased, from 24 to 30 months &ndash; this increases opportunities for exporters to export a wider range of cattle.  </p>  <p>  In January, my Department reached agreement with Qatar on a health cert for the export of sheep for slaughter. </p>  <p>   I have extended an invitation to my Algerian counterpart to visit Ireland in early 2019. This follows earlier contact with Algeria, to try and reach agreement on revised and separate slaughter, fattening and breeding certs.</p>  <p>   In relation to Egypt, the Chief Veterinary Officer recently wrote to his counterpart seeking agreement on three proposed health certificates for the export of fattening, slaughter and breeding cattle. </p>  <p>  It may be recalled that in 2017, I reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves less than three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal. This brought greater equity in the fees payable for calves, weanlings and adult cattle and gave an important boost to the trade.  Since then we have continued to see significant growth in the exports of calves, rising from 102,000 in 2017 to 159,000 in 2018 - an increase of 56%.   In the same period the total live exports of cattle increased by over 30% to 246,000 head compared to 2017. </p>  <p>  Despite these many positive developments for live export markets, I am also well aware of the challenges faced by the sector, including transport capacity and lairage capacity at Cherbourg. My Department officials visited Cherbourg in September last year to discuss the capacity issue with French officials and local lairage owners. My officials continue to meet with ferry companies to explore new routes to continental Europe or the potential for carrying livestock on existing routes, and to ensure that the greatest facilitation possible is afforded to livestock exporters in the important Spring period.  The pending approval of a new ferry  will contribute to addressing capacity issues.</p></reply>

The loans will be competitively priced and will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  SBCI has just issued an open call inviting banks and other lenders to become lending partners and this call has a closing date of 11 February 2019. SBCI advise that a period of due diligence, which will include the EIF, will follow. I have urged SBCI to operationalise the Scheme as soon as possible. The Scheme will run for three years from its launch date and further announcements in this regard will be made shortly.</p></reply>

The proposals are ultimately a matter for agreement between Ministers for Finance and Heads of State.  The European Commission has proposed, as part of the MFF, that funding for the Common Agricultural Policy should not exceed &euro;365 billion for the period 2021-2027. This equates to a cut of around 5% compared to the current provision.  Latest reports are indicating that negotiations on the next MFF will not be finalised until Autumn 2019.</p>  <p>  I have been working closely with my European colleagues to build a consensus to reverse the cut to the CAP budget and to maintain support to CAP at the current EU 27 level.  In May last year, I, along with my EU Ministerial colleagues from France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland signed a joint Memorandum seeking the retention of the CAP budget at current levels.  The Memorandum was presented at the Agri-Fish Council in Luxembourg in June 2018 and up to 20 other EU Ministers have signalled their support to this proposal now.  At the Agrifish Council on 16 July 2018 France and Germany presented a joint declaration on the CAP proposals including a joint rejection of the cuts proposed. This paper was supported by other Member states including Croatia, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Belgium and Ireland. </p>  <p>  I had a further opportunity to discuss the CAP budget at the recent Agri-Fish Council which took place on the 28 January.  I again emphasised the point that we need to ensure an adequate budget for Pillar I and Pillar II.   Over the coming months detailed negotiations will continue at all levels across the EU as we work together to shape the final outcome. At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that CAP Post 2020, properly funded, will continue to support farm families and the rural economy. </p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that I will continue to work to develop a broad consensus on the value of a strong, fit for purpose agriculture sector, and work to reverse the cuts proposed in the draft MFF.</p></reply>

This exciting project aims to tackle the threat of plastic pollution in our marine environment by encouraging Irish trawlers to collect marine litter while at sea. Approximately 80% of marine debris is made up of plastics which do not biodegrade, but rather break up into tiny particulates. This poses a risk to marine wildlife as well as our fish stocks so it is prudent that action is taken to remove as much plastics from the marine environment as possible.</p>  <p>  The Clean Oceans Initiative, funded by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, will provide on-board storage facilities and on-shore infrastructure for environmentally friendly disposal of all plastic waste and fishing gear recovered at sea.  My ambition is to have all Irish trawlers at every pier and port actively participating in Ireland&rsquo;s first co-ordinated initiative to collect, reduce and reuse marine litter and clean up our marine environment by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  I have tasked Bord Iascaigh Mhara with assembling a collaborative multi-stakeholder team, to focus on solutions for marine litter prevention and removal.  BIM will also reach out to the wider coastal community and I look forward to receiving proposals for further innovative solutions for the prevention and removal of marine litter.  I have asked BIM to report quarterly on progress on this Initiative and I have been heartened to see how broadly it has been welcomed to date.</p></reply>

Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  Looking beyond Europe, Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this regard, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia 2018. These missions included participants from across the agri-food sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.

That funding has been put to very good use on initiatives such as its Brexit Barometer, which has been helping companies to assess and improve their preparedness for Brexit, and its Market Prioritisation reports, which are informing its own and my Department&rsquo;s work in relation to market diversification. Bord Bia has also been very active in engaging with companies in relation to issues such as supply chain management, customs processes, customer relationships and market diversification.</p>  <p>In addition, Bord Bia, along with officials from my Department, has been participating in the recent series of public outreach events being co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the banner &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;.

Despite the challenges our industry has faced, Irish agri-food exports have shown great resilience and are estimated at &euro;13.6 billion in total in 2018, including &euro;12.1 billion in food and drink exports, which is 64% higher than comparative figures for 2010.    </p>  <p>  Bord Bia has played a vital role in that export success by enhancing and promoting our focus on quality, innovation and sustainability.  The development of the Origin Green programme, providing proof of the sector&rsquo;s sustainability credentials, has played an important part.  Bord Bia works closely with my Department and is central to our work of growing and developing new and existing markets, based on consumer insights and market prioritisation. International markets outside the EU now account for almost 30% of our total export value. In 2018, I led trade missions to Turkey, US and Canada, to China, to Malaysia and Indonesia. </p>  <p>   As an agency, Bord Bia has played a key role in our Brexit response to date, facilitating conversations at the highest levels with UK retail CEOs, and ensuring that our ongoing commitment to the UK market is fully understood.  UK remains by far our most valuable market, for very valid reasons &ndash; it is our closest geographical market, with strongly integrated supply chains and a hugely valuable  grocery market. We have no intention of stepping back from the UK market.  </p>  <p>Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer   has been used to identify evolving client priorities and concerns and to further inform Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit programmes and supports. As a result of the many findings from the two exercises it carried out in 2017 and 2018, Bord Bia has provided a series of Brexit support programmes focussed on Supply Chains, Customs Requirements regarding Trade, and, Currency Risk for the industry, alongside a customer engagement plan to communicate to key UK stakeholders the preparedness of Irish food and drinks suppliers. </p>  <p>  Since the Brexit vote in 2016, I have allocated significant additional tranches of funding for Bord Bia, as a key part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to support the agrifood sector in responding to Brexit uncertainty. </p>  <p>  In September 2017, I announced  funding of &euro;6.745 million for Bord Bia to undertake a programme of additional activities, based on Brexit Barometer analysis, to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit. The funding was additional to the &euro;1.6 million I provided to Bord Bia in Autumn 2016 for grants to assist food companies highly dependent on the UK market and an additional &euro;2 million allocated to Bord Bia as part of their 2017 Grant for increased expenditure on programmes.  </p>  <p>   In Budget 2019, I provided a further allocation of &euro;5.3 million to Bord Bia, bringing its total grant in aid to &euro;46.6 million for 2019.  This compares to a grant of &euro;28.9 million in 2014, and represents a 60% increase in funding for marketing and promotion of our food  sector over five years.  </p>  <p>   Bord Bia also received approval last year to recruit an additional 32 staff, which will bring total staff numbers to 146 in 2019.</p></reply>

Trawling for sprat by vessels over 18m will be phased out by 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  Based on my assessment, I considered that there was a compelling case for excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles. Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleet comprises approximately 2,000 vessels but fewer than 200 of these are large trawlers. In environmental terms, large vessels trawling can have a significant impact both on fish stocks and on important coastal marine environments.   Excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles will provide wider ecosystem benefits, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks.</p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for these fishermen.  According to BIM&rsquo;s report, if smaller vessels take up all of the opportunities currently fished by vessels over 18m inside the 6nm zone it would mean an increase of 62% in the value of their landings.  While it is unlikely that the volume of landings will simply be transferred from larger vessels to smaller vessels, the percentage gains for individual small vessels in our inshore fishing sector are hugely significant to the coastal communities they come from.  </p>  <p>  I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.  These measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and sea angling sectors, which the Government has committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. </p>  <p>  Consideration of the CAP proposals is ongoing at EU level.  Since the legislative proposals were launched in June 2018 a total of 25 Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian Presidency.  The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  In addition, CAP post 2020 is also a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.  </p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency outlined an equally intensive programme of Working Group meetings to discuss specific aspects of the CAP proposals for the duration of their Presidency.  </p>  <p>  I had a further opportunity to discuss the proposals at the recent Agri-Fish Council on Monday 28 January. Agriculture Ministers exchanged views on the new performance-based delivery model.  Discussions focussed in particular on the annual deadline of reporting requirements, and  a progressive approach to targets and possible deviations in the first two years of implementation of the new programme.  My Ministerial colleagues and I also discussed the agricultural reserve and financial discipline.   Also on the CAP proposals, we held an exchange of views on the wine related provisions set out in the common market organisation amended regulations, including the possibility of opening the market to new wine grape varieties.  Commissioner Hogan informed delegations about the proposed green architecture.  Also during the CAP discussions, a group of Member States, led by the Slovenian delegation, presented a declaration on having appropriate funding for rural development in the next MFF.</p>  <p>  The overall level of the CAP budget post 2020 is a key priority for me.  Member States are facing a 3.9% cut to Pillar 1 Direct Payments funding, and a 15% cut to Pillar 2 Rural Development funding.  This is unacceptable in my view especially in light of the current developing situation surrounding Brexit.  The retention of an adequate budget for the CAP post 2020 is a key priority for Ireland.  The CAP budget is part of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the EU which is a matter for unanimous agreement by Heads of State and Government. </p>  <p>  I have been advocating strongly amongst my agriculture counterparts to maintain a strong CAP budget.  I co-signed a Joint Memorandum in Madrid in May last year, which calls for the CAP budget to be retained at current levels for the EU 27 post 2020.  The memorandum has been supported by up to 20 other EU Agriculture Ministers.</p>  <p>  We will continue to work together on this issue as the negotiations for the CAP post 2020 and its budgetary allocations progress, and I will continue to seek to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agrifood sector.</p></reply>

As such, Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on farmers and on the agri-food sector throughout Ireland, and the extent of this potential impact has been highlighted by studies carried out by agencies such as Teagasc, the Department of Finance, the Economic and Social Research Institute, Inter Trade Ireland and Copenhagen Economics.</p><p>The most immediate challenge for industry has been to deal with the impact caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro. A considerable amount of work has also been put into intensifying our market diversification efforts in order to reduce our exposure to the UK market.</p><p>I have been addressing these challenges through a range of Budgetary measures aimed at improving competitiveness, and developing market and product diversification. These measures include a &euro;150m low-cost loan scheme in 2017 to help reduce farm-gate business costs, and a dedicated &euro;50m Brexit package in Budget 2018 which included further additional funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc as well as a contribution to a &euro;300m (joint DAFM/DBEI) &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, at least 40% of which is available to food businesses. In Budget 2019 I announced a &euro;78m Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit. My colleague, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, also announced the Future Growth Loan Scheme,<b></b>which will be rolled out in 2019 and for which I had made provision of &euro;25m in 2018. The scheme will provide long term, unsecured investment finance for farmers and small scale companies in the food and seafood sectors.</p><p>On market and product diversification, the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia has been used, inter alia, to provide targeted advice to individual companies as well as to conduct a market prioritisation exercise which is now informing our approach to market diversification activities, including the choice of destinations for Trade Missions.  Trade Missions play an important role in this regard, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia 2018. These missions included participants from across the agri-food sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  These and the other missions that my Department has under consideration for 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  Indeed, since the UK referendum I have increased Bord Bia&rsquo;s funding by a total of &euro;19.5 million, including a further &euro;5 million allocated in Budget 2019</p><p>Product diversification has also been supported through additional funding of &euro;8.8 million to Teagasc to develop its National Food Innovation Hub, and funding to support investment in the prepared consumer foods sector. </p><p>I and my officials have also been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p><p>Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan last week to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves. </p><p>As regards contingency planning, my Department has been actively participating in the Whole-of-Government approach to preparedness and contingency planning. We have fed into the overall Government Contingency Action Plan which was published on 19 December, and we have been working very closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies to address in particular the requirements that will arise in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on agri-food products coming from the UK.</p><p>These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. </p><p>Work in this regard has been focused on three key areas, namely, infrastructure, staffing and information technology, and in three key locations, that is Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport.</p><p>On infrastructure, we have been engaging very closely with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the physical facilities that will be required to carry out import controls at the three locations. This work had been proceeding in any event in the context of dealing with the central case scenario, and has been adapted in order to meet the requirements in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p><p>On staffing, the Department is working very effectively with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls, and I am confident that the state will be in a position to apply controls at the appropriate time.  </p><p>On information technology, my Department has established a project to coordinate the identification and delivery of ICT Infrastructure and systems to support the additional requirements of staff engaged in control processes in Dublin Port, Rosslare and Dublin Airport. The delivery timelines in the event of a disorderly Brexit are extremely challenging, but officials are working with the greatest urgency to ensure that the required ICT services are in place by 29 March 2019.</p><p>Throughout all of this work, the focus of the Department will continue to be on the need to discharge its legal responsibilities while ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trade.</p></reply>

As such, applications for tree felling licences are carefully assessed by my officials to ensure that the proposed tree felling or thinning  is suitable for both the management of the trees on site and the care and protection of the land and surrounding environment. </p>  <p>  As regards the case in question, a General Felling Licence was issued under the Forestry Act 1946 on the 7th   April 2017 to thin a forest area.

Beef exports from Ireland in 2017 were valued at &euro;2,405m, of which 48 percent (&euro;1,162m) were sent to the UK.  Dairy exports from Ireland in 2017 were valued at &euro;4,646m, of which 21 percent (&euro;997m) were sent to the UK.  However, certain dairy exports (cheddar &amp;amp; other cheeses for example) rely almost entirely on the UK market.</p>  <p>  Under the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs and duty rates for certain beef products are equivalent to a 70% tariff rate and for certain dairy products up to the equivalent of a 50% tariff rate </p>  <p>  Retention of the UK market for the dairy and beef industry is a key component of the Government's response to Brexit.  In addition, I have introduced a range of measures to help these sectors to deal with the impacts of Brexit -</p>  <p>  - In Budget 2017, a farm-gate business costs reduction measure in order to enhance competitiveness, including a &euro;150m low-cost loan scheme;</p>  <p>  - In Budget 2018, a &euro;50m, dedicated Brexit package which included a contribution to a &euro;300m (joint DAFM/DBEI) &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, at least 40% of which is available to food businesses. </p>  <p>  - In Budget 2019, a &euro;78m Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit. </p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia since the UK referendum - a total of &euro;19.5 million - is being used, among other things, to provide direct support and advice to individual companies in relation to market diversification and to compile its market prioritisation reports, which are informing its own and my Department's work in this area. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have met with the chief executives of all of the major British retailers to impress upon them the commitment of Irish suppliers in continuing to supply the UK market post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  More generally, the pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports, including dairy and beef exports, is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming years. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have also been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan last week to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors.

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. These proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP 2021-27.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the CAP proposals is ongoing at EU level.  Since the legislative proposals were launched in June 2018 a total of 25 Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian Presidency.  The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  In addition, CAP post 2020 is also a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.  </p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency has outlined an equally intensive programme of Working Group meetings to discuss specific aspects of the CAP proposals for the duration of their Presidency.  I had a further opportunity to discuss the proposals at the recent Agri-Fish Council which took place on Monday 28 January.</p>  <p>  The EU proposed CAP budgetary ceilings form part of the wider proposals on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027.  These proposals are ultimately a matter for agreement between Ministers for Finance and Heads of State.  </p>  <p>  The MFF post 2020 proposals, outline a funding envelope of &euro;365 billion for the Common Agricultural Policy. This represents an approximate cut of 5%, when compared to the current period.  This is unacceptable for Ireland.</p>  <p>   The MFF proposals also provide for spending in areas such as research, migration and defence, which are priorities for some Member States.  The loss of UK contributions to the EU budget  add a further complication to these already challenging negotiations. </p>  <p>  Throughout these negotiations, achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities will be a key issue for the Government. Ireland has stated clearly that it is important that traditional policies with demonstrated added value continue to be properly supported. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is such a policy and a strong budget for the CAP post 2020 remains a key priority for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  From an agriculture perspective, I have been working closely with EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to protect the CAP budget in the next MFF. Given that MFF  matters are decided by unanimity, it is essential to build alliances around critical goals. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, I have had a series of bilateral meetings with EU counterparts, to build support for a strong CAP budget post 2020. Furthermore,  In May 2018, I   agreed a Memorandum, with five European colleagues, seeking to maintain CAP funding for the 2021 - 27 period at current EU 27 levels. I, along with my Ministerial colleagues from France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland, have signed the Memorandum.  Support has grown for this position and up to 20 Member States have now expressed their support for this proposal.</p>  <p>  Over the coming months there will be detailed negotiations at all levels across the EU as member states work together to shape the final outcome of both the CAP and the MFF proposals. I can assure the deputy that the need to ensure that the CAP is properly funded, and continues to support farm families and the rural economy, will remain at the very centre of our considerations. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work to develop a broad consensus on the need for a  strong and fit-for-purpose agriculture sector at the heart of the European Union.</p></reply>

Other notable achievements were agreements with Qatar and Kuwait which allowed for the importation of Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry to their markets. </p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of EU-agreed trade deals such as those completed with Canada, Japan and Mexico, my Department also continues to prioritise efforts to gain access to new third country markets and, equally importantly, to deepen existing markets for Irish dairy products.</p>  <p>  We have also had success with exports to emerging markets.  The value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America stood at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports. </p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which just under &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017. Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly, to reach &euro;370 million. </p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is, of course, an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  Indeed, I have been very active in leading a number of successful Trade Missions to a range of destinations. In the last two years alone, I have led Missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia.  </p>  <p>  Looking for example at my most recent Trade Mission to Indonesia and Malaysia last October, I opened Bord Bia dairy conferences in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, which were focused on raising awareness of Ireland as a location for sustainable dairy production, as well as enhancing the Irish Industry&rsquo;s understanding of the Indonesian and Malaysian market.  They were followed by business meetings between Irish dairy companies and potential partners.  The conferences hosted 140 Indonesian and Malaysian dairy buyers, importers and foodservice operators. </p>  <p>  These were excellent opportunities to bring targeted retail buyers, suppliers and consumers together. Having our own Irish dairy companies there working together to promote Irish dairy in general, as well as their own particular brands, was an excellent chance to showcase the best of Irish dairy, based on our excellent food safety and controls systems, to a wider audience.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

In 2017 the roundwood harvest  (including firewood) was 3.54 million cubic metres, the highest level since records began,  42% of  which was used for energy purposes.  Timber production is set to double to 8 million cubic metres in the years up to 2035 and the majority of this will come from private forests.  It is very important that this material is mobilised  in order the meet the growing demand for biomass.  </p><p>In this respect, the successful introduction of Knowledge Transfer Groups in 2018 , which  give private owners the knowledge to bring their product to market is a  significant initiative. This scheme will re-open shortly to new members.</p><p>Ongoing support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific  &ldquo;<i>forestry for fibre</i>&rdquo; scheme. My Department  provides grant aid for the construction of forest roads which helps in the mobilisation of biomass and  also funds a woodland improvement scheme for thinning of broadleaved woodlands, a key source of domestic heating fuel.</p><p>We also support the <i>woodenergy.ie</i>portal which provides advice on supply chain costings and technologies for forest-based biomass. Another recent development is an on-line  All Roundwood Production Forecast  tool. This enables area-based forecasts of roundwood availability and may be accessed via my  Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

However, it is important to note that this is not a measure of a typical carbon footprint per unit of agricultural output (per kg meat or milk) nor is it an indicator of climate inefficiency. </p>  <p>Further, the assessment in the referred report excludes Land use change (LULUCF) emissions and removals (CO2  ) from cropland and grassland also associated with agricultural activities, only including methane and nitrous oxide. This is in contrast to typical life cycle analysis that includes all emissions including those in the LULUCF category under the Inventory framework.</p>  <p>  The European Parliament Report shows that Ireland has gained productivity efficiency with respect to greenhouse gases (GHGs). The FAO has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production systems. Evidence of this is further reflected in the EU Joint Research Centre Report (2010) which illustrated that while intensive dairy systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change. Lowest emissions are created by extensive grassland systems, such as those in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Overall, I believe Ireland is in a good position with regard to utilising the value of life cycle assessments. Under Origin Green programme,  over 200,000 carbon audits have been completed on Irish dairy and beef farms since its introduction. Additionally, through the use of the Carbon Navigator, farmers are provided with advice and feedback on practices that effectively reduce the carbon-footprint of farm produce, and improve the economic performance at farm level.</p></reply>

As such, Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on farmers and on the agri-food sector throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  At this stage, Ireland has not formally notified the Commission that it is seeking emergency aid for the farming sector either through EU Regulation No. 702/2014 &ndash; the Agriculture Block Exemption Regulation - or under Article 219 of (EU) Regulation No 1308/2013. However, there are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties facing Ireland. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan last week to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

We provide non-earmarked core funding to the agency on an annual basis and intend to continue this in 2019. </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department provided &euro;3,500,000 to UNFPA, an increase of &euro;700,000 on our 2017 core contribution. As the T&aacute;naiste outlined in his speech at the launch of the UNFPA&rsquo;s State of the World Population Report in October, Ireland is proud to be a consistent supporter of UNFPA. Since 2006 we have provided funding of around &euro;55 million to the Population Fund, the majority of which is core funding. Ireland values the critical work of UNFPA and is committed to core funding on the principle that this allows the agency to set their priorities and plan according to need which is, we believe, critical to the on-the-ground delivery of results.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not currently providing funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Supplies Thematic Programme and no decision to fund this specific programme in 2019 has been taken to date. </p>  <p>The Government   is committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030. My Department is working to ensure that our international development assistance supports the achievement of the SDGs in developing countries. Ireland&rsquo;s international development programme has always been focused on the need to protect the most vulnerable in society, and through for example our core support to UNFPA, contribute to the SDGs&rsquo; transformative ambition of &lsquo;Leave No One Behind&rsquo; and in particular to reach the furthest behind first. Reaching them and delivering responsive supports and services is essential for creating inclusive societies and achieving sustainable development.</p></reply>

The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is an integral part of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and addresses the fundamental rights and citizenship provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Commission Task Force conducted the negotiations with the UK on the Withdrawal Agreement. Throughout this process, I engaged actively with each of my British Government counterparts to underline the Government&rsquo;s concerns about the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland and the imperative of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the achievements of the Peace Process, and I continue to do so. Over the course of the last several months, I have met with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab during his time as UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley and David Lidington, the UK Minister of the Cabinet Office, with whom I remain in regular contact.</p>  <p>  I also speak regularly with the leaders of each of the political parties in Northern Ireland on the European Union&rsquo;s endeavours to ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement throughout the Article 50 negotiations and ratification process. I held discussions most recently on this with each of the party leaders, including Arlene Foster, in Belfast on 10 January where I reiterated its vital importance.</p>  <p>  Throughout the negotiations between the UK and the EU Task Force, I and my officials were in frequent communication with Michel Barnier and his team, as well as with the other EU27 Member States. In my contacts with EU partners, Member States and institutions, they showed, and continue to show unwavering solidarity on the backstop, for which I am extremely grateful. </p>  <p>  A no deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU.  That is why the Government&rsquo;s focus remains on securing the deal that has been reached. The Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government. </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and the gains of the Peace Process. Importantly, nothing in the Agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. It also protects the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity and confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens. It provides for a period of transition, which can be extended, in which preparations can be made for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. The European Council has made clear that it stands by the Withdrawal Agreement and that it is not for renegotiation.</p>  <p>  Under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the British Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement and the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

This is applied for through the EU Customs Decisions System which can be accessed online by any trader with a valid Revenue Online Service (ROS) Certificate and an Economic Operators' Registration and Identification (EORI) number.  One of the conditions of the Comprehensive Guarantee is a requirement to have security in place to cover potential or existing customs and VAT debt. </p><p>Revenue advise me that each trader is responsible for making arrangements with their own financial institution to ensure that the necessary security and banking structures are in place.

These new arrangements do not affect the way income tax and other statutory deductions are calculated under the PAYE system, but do change the way employers report payroll information to Revenue. In most cases the new real-time reporting arrangements have seamlessly integrated into employer&rsquo;s payroll systems without any impact on employees.  </p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s general information, the PAYE system does not treat people on temporary contracts any differently to those on full time or permanent contracts. As such, employers are obliged to notify Revenue where an employee has started or has ceased working for them, regardless of the employment status involved. This ensures that employees gain the full benefit of their tax credit and rate band entitlements each time they are paid. For example, where Revenue is notified of the cessation of an employment, the person&rsquo;s tax credit and rate band entitlements are automatically transferred to any other active employment that s/he may have. </p>  <p>  The application of the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis of deduction only occurs in limited circumstances, for example where there is a lack of information about previous employments or where application of the cumulative basis would create significant hardship for the employee. Under PAYE Modernisation, employers are required to report the pay and tax details of their employees every time they run a payroll, which means the individual records should always be up to date. Consequently, it is expected that people in irregular employment should pay the proper amount of tax at each pay date and that the application of the &lsquo;Week 1&rsquo; basis of deduction should only occur in limited circumstances.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.</p>  <p>  One of the main roles of the Ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers. The FSPO was established to provide an alternative to the Courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial or pension service provider and all investigations by the Ombudsman are free of charge to the consumer.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, a finding of the Ombudsman in respect of a complaint is legally binding on all parties </p>  <p>  The FSPO has advised me that the services provided by him are confidential in nature, and it would not be appropriate for him to confirm or deny the existence of a complaint, nor would it be appropriate to comment on any individual case.  </p>  <p>  On the issue more generally the FSPO provides a dedicated information service, which handles both phone and email enquiries.  This service provides assistance on how to access the FSPO's services, to initiate a complaint or discuss a complaint. The Deputy may wish to suggest that the complainant contact the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to discuss their case with a member of staff.</p></reply>

These are: that an offence has been, is being or is likely to be committed; that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation, other than one arising under the worker's contract of employment or other contract whereby the worker undertakes to do or perform personally any work or services; that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur; that the health or safety of any individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered; that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged; that an unlawful or otherwise improper use of funds or resources of a public body, or of other public money, has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur; that an act or omission by or on behalf of a public body is oppressive, discriminatory or grossly negligent or constitutes gross mismanagement; and that information tending to show any matter falling within any of the above categories has been, is being or is likely to be concealed or destroyed.</p>  <p>  It is not necessary for a worker to explicitly state that they are making a protected disclosure when they make a disclosure which they believe to come within the relevant wrongdoings outlined above.  If it is unclear whether the matter qualifies as a protected disclosure, the employer should treat it as such until they are satisfied that it does not so qualify.  In any event, providing that the worker discloses information relating to wrongdoing in an appropriate manner, and based on a reasonable belief, no question of penalisation should arise.  Furthermore, section 5 of the Act provides that in proceedings involving an issue as to whether a disclosure is a protected disclosure it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that it is.</p>  <p>  The Act provides for a number of remedies for workers who believe that they have suffered penalisation as a result of making a protected disclosure.  Those remedies apply to workers in both the public and private sectors.  Workers who are direct employees are provided with access to the normal industrial dispute mechanisms of the State, including the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, and the compensation payable under those mechanisms is increased in respect of persons penalised for having made a protected disclosure.  An employee dismissed for having made a protected disclosure can claim unfair dismissal, regardless of their length of service, and may also make a claim for interim relief to the Circuit Court pending final determination of their case. The Act also provides a right of action in tort for a person who has suffered detriment as a result of a protected disclosure, and immunity from civil liability other than in defamation actions.</p></reply>

A revised Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour (the Code) was published by the Standards in Public Office Commission in September 2008.  This Code, which applies to all civil servants, is an important element of the overall framework within which civil servants are expected to work.  It sets out the standards required of civil servants in the discharge of their duties.  </p>  <p>  The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 (the Bill) is a key consideration in terms of updating this current Code.  This Bill provides for a Public Sector Standards Commissioner to replace the current Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPOC). Section 30 of the Bill provides that the Commissioner shall draw up and issue a model code of conduct for the guidance of public officials  with regard to compliance with the provisions of the Bill. This model code must have regard to the general principles on standards of integrity contained in section 10 of the Bill.  Furthermore, the Commissioner must promote, through training, education and research, and guidelines issued for the purpose by the Commissioner, the highest standards of conduct and integrity among public officials, and, in particular, regarding the prevention of situations in which conflicts of interest could arise in relation to their duties. </p>  <p>  Under the Bill, public bodies may adopt their own codes to meet particular requirements while having regard to the principles and standards in the model code.  Sectorial codes will be drawn up by particular bodies (e.g. for the Civil Service by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform).   The Commissioner may advise as to whether amendments to any such code are required.  </p>  <p>  So once enacted, this Bill will allow my Department to review the current Code in the context of the Commissioners model code and revise it as required.   Further information on the current position regarding the Bill is at APPENDIX 1. </p>  <p>  The Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour is a document that reflects the standards required of civil servants in the performance of their official duties. There are also various circulars relating to the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants.</p>  <p>  Currently, the ethics obligations of civil servants, including the provision of ethics returns, is dealt with under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 (the Ethics Acts).</p>  <p>  It would seem unlikely that there would be conflicts between membership professional codes of ethics and the current Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour .  However, should issues arise, there is provision in the Code (para. 3.2) for staff to obtain clarification on any aspect of the Code.  In addition, under section 10(12) of the Act the SIPOC can give advice on the Code in particular circumstances.  </p>  <p>  APPENDIX 1 </p>  <p>  The Public Sector  Standards Bill is currently making its way through the legislative process in the D&aacute;il. It commenced Committee Stage on the 6th of April 2017, where sections 1 to 42 of the 66 sections in the Bill were agreed. Much work has been completed since the Bill was considered in Committee, including work specifically requested by the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach (FPER) Committee, prior to the re-commencement of Committee Stage. This includes:</p>  <p>  - Briefing for all Members of the Oireachtas in relation to the Bill;</p>  <p>  - Discussions with T.D.s from other Political Parties in order to seek some cross-party consensus for the Bill. This included a meeting with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien from Sinn F&eacute;in in November 2017;</p>  <p>  - A meeting with Local Authority Representative Groups following their appearance before the FPER Committee;</p>  <p>  - A meeting with the CCMA; and</p>  <p>  The development of Report Stage amendments for the Bill which have been approved by Government, in order to resolve and address various issues that have been raised on foot of the consultations, meetings and briefings described above.</p>  <p>   My Department is currently awaiting a re-commencement date for Committee Stage of the Bill.</p></reply>

The verification process involved checking the school&rsquo;s data as used in the Identification process, in terms of the quality and accuracy of the data supplied and the match rate to CSO small area. This process confirmed no change in the level of disadvantage identified for this school and correspondence was issued in September 2017 notifying them of the outcome.</p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this requires the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes Meakstown is located in the Finglas East_Ballymun_Dublin 11 school planning area.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF).</p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next 4 years (2019 to 2022).

This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 139 are primary ASD classes and 41 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available by county on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i></p><p>From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required.

The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of Special Education Needs. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders was published in July 2016. </p><p>The NCSE review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides daytime respite for families and a structured day for students. </p><p>However, the NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down syndrome.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and representatives from other relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There are no plans to change the July provision scheme coverage until this work is complete.</p></reply>

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  My Department has shown a willingness to engage with staff representatives on this matter as evidenced by the Chairman's Note discussions.</p></reply>

The Action Plan contained 18 different administrative and legislative actions required by the Istanbul Convention.  Most of the legislative requirements were met in the Domestic Violence Act 2018, the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Jurisdiction) Bill 2018 is the final legislative action to be enacted to allow for ratification.  This legislation is required to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over Convention offences committed abroad by Irish citizens and residents. </p>  <p>  On 30 January 2019, the Criminal Law (Extraterritorial Bill) 2018 completed all stages in the Seanad.  The Bill will now progress to second stage in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday 12 February. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted in quarter one, 2019. </p>  <p>  This is a very short but important Bill, that once enacted, will allow Ireland to ratify the Istanbul Convention shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Neither may be established without the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, among other requirements.</p><p>Community based CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>There have to date been 28 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;500,000. A further 5 applications to the scheme are being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>As information requested by the Deputy, the following table sets out the breakdown by county of the applications approved for funding to date and the level of funding for which approval has been granted.</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Number of Approved Schemes</th><th>Amount of Grant Aid Approved</th><th>Year </th></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;40,000</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>14</td><td>&euro;334,573</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;8,835</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>3</td><td>&euro;77,915</td><td>2018</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td><td>&euro;40,000</td><td>2018</td></tr></table></p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie</p></reply>

Some of these difficulties had arisen because third party agents had been able to secure multiple appointments through the use of automatic software. </p>  <p>  A set of software fixes was introduced in mid-September 2018 to prevent this abuse of the system.  As far as can be determined, this software update has been successful in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents.  The system is being regularly monitored in this regard. INIS is aware that some third party agents continue to book individual appointments with information supplied to them by customers. INIS strongly advises our customers not to provide sensitive personal data to these unregulated agents.    </p>  <p>  I am also advised that INIS is currently developing a replacement online appointments system which will be operational later this year, and which is being designed to prevent the block-booking of appointments. This new system will also assist in streamlining and improving the current online booking process. As part of the INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020, a number of other options are also being considered with a view to improving customer service and efficiency as well as meeting the growing demand for registration in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Commissioner has now informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to front-line policing in 2019. </p><p>I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities.

The responses to that consultation and other possible policy levers are being considered by my Department with a view to developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy which will require the involvement of stakeholders from across the health service.  I expect that my Department will make progress in this regard in 2019.</p><p>  At an operational level, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017 which is making considerable progress using a collaborative approach with hospital pharmacists and clinical teams to bring about changes in prescribing practice.  In that respect, hospitals are working towards a targeted minimum prescribing rate for biosimilars of 50%.</p></reply>

The HSE, in line with the National Service Plan 2019 will provide 3.3 million outpatient appointments, more than 1 million of which will be first outpatient appointments. </p><p>In 2019, the HSE will focus in particular on specialties with a high volume of referrals and large proportions of long-waiting patients. In addition, the NTPF, with an increased allocation of &euro;75 million in 2019, will fund an additional 40,000 first outpatient appointments through weekend and out of hour&rsquo;s clinics and &lsquo;see and treat&rsquo; clinics. </p><p>The NTPF will deliver this additional activity in the health service by working with hospital groups and individual hospitals as well as private health providers to maximise the number of patients treated in both a public and private capacity. I would strongly encourage all hospitals, including Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise and Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore, to collaborate with the NTPF to identify waiting list initiatives.</p><p>The latest Published NTPF Waiting list figures are available at: <i></i></p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is set out below:</p><p>Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore &ndash; Orthopaedic Outpatient Waiting List</p><p><table><tr><th>0-3 mths </th><th>3-6 mths </th><th>6-9 mths </th><th>9-12 mths </th><th>12-15 mths </th><th>15-18 mths </th><th>18-21 mths </th><th>21-24 mths </th><th>24-36 mths </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>910 </td><td>697 </td><td>494 </td><td>297 </td><td>172 </td><td>111 </td><td>110 </td><td>77 </td><td>156 </td><td>3024 </td></tr></table></p><p>There is only 1 patient on the Orthopaedic Outpatient Waiting List at Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise.</p></reply>

Influenza vaccine is most effective when circulating viruses are well-matched with viruses contained in vaccines due to their constant evolving nature.  These recommendations are used by national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines. </p><p>The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere influenza season.  The WHO issued its advice on 22 February 2018, recommending that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2018/19 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:</p><p>- an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;</p><p>- an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus;</p><p>- a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and</p><p>- a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).</p><p>It also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2018/19 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe and is providing good protection against the influenza A strain viruses that are circulating this season as the majority of hospitalisations are associated with influenza A. </p><p>The WHO will shortly be holding a consultation and information meeting in Beijing, China on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2019/20 northern hemisphere influenza season between the 18 to 20 February.  After this meeting the WHO will announce its recommendation for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2019/20 northern hemisphere<b></b>influenza season<b></b>for both quadrivalent and trivalent vaccines.  The Flu vaccine purchased by HSE will be based on this advice. </p><p>The HSE National Immunisation Office and HSE Procurement are responsible for the purchase of influenza vaccine.  To ensure adequate vaccine supply, this tender process must be completed 9 months in advance of the first delivery into Ireland by the end of August as it takes about 6 months to manufacture sufficient vaccine quantity for each season. It is intended that a quadrivalent vaccine will be used for 2019/20 and a procurement process through the HSE is currently underway.  The composition of the vaccine will be based on the advices of the WHO for the 2019/20 northern hemisphere<b></b>influenza season which is due to be announced in a few weeks&rsquo; time.</p><p>The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for the following at risk groups:</p><p>- persons who are 65 years of age and over;</p><p>- pregnant women;</p><p>- persons who have a long-term health condition;</p><p>- persons who work in healthcare;</p><p>- carers;</p><p>- persons living in a nursing home or other long-term care facility; and</p><p>- persons who are in regular contact with pigs, poultry or water fowl. </p><p>As of 27 January 2019 (week 4) there were 1,066 confirmed influenza related hospitalised cases compared to 1,825 for the same time period last year.  The number of confirmed deaths for week 4, 2019 is 25 compared to 112 for the same time period last year. </p><p>The 2017/18 influenza season was a severe season with a high impact placed on the Irish health system.  During the 2017/18 influenza season, 255 influenza related cases were reported as having died, the highest number of influenza deaths recorded in any season.  The total number of confirmed influenza cases hospitalised during the 2017/18 influenza season was 4,713 which<b></b>exceeded all previous seasons on record since surveillance began in 2000.</p><p>Vaccination still remains the most effective means of preventing infection caused by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and even death.</p><p>The HSE reviews and updates its influenza plans annually, including its communication strategy, taking into account the lessons learned from previous years, with a view to targeting key groups in order to create the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.</p></reply>

My officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible. This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and is in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy and the 7 Point Action Plan on market access that I launched in April 2017. </p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy and meat markets are strong, with growing global demand projected from fast developing countries with increasing middle classes and more westernised diets. Whilst significant challenges have continued throughout recent years, in particular price volatility in the dairy sector, there is confidence that the Irish food industry is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand, underpinned by the success of our efforts and those of the Irish food industry. </p>  <p>  The opening of the Chinese beef market to six Irish beef establishments in 2018 was a notable success, following several years of effort. My officials are in the process of trying to get additional establishments approved by the Chinese authorities. In 2018 markets for Irish beef, sheepmeat and poultry were also opened in Kuwait and Qatar. </p>  <p>  Enhanced market access for Irish dairy was secured with a number of destination markets in 2017 and 2018. Agreement with third country competent authorities was reached resulting in renegotiated bilateral certification requirements for various dairy product categories, including with Japan and Mexico.</p>  <p>  The role of my Department is to open up markets for the industry and it is then up to the industry with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of these opportunities. However, the actual levels of exports will depend on a range of factors, including as global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements. </p></reply>

As such, Brexit has the potential to have a very significant impact on farmers and on the agrifood sector throughout Ireland, and the extent of this potential impact has been highlighted by studies carried out by agencies such as Teagasc, the Department of Finance, the Economic and Social Research Institute, Inter Trade Ireland and Copenhagen Economics.</p>  <p>  In the event that there is disruption to Irish exports moving through the UK, I am informed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has engaged with the shipping industry and has been advised that there is sufficient capacity within the industry should exporters using the UK wish to divert.  </p>  <p>  A considerable amount of work has also been put into intensifying our market diversification efforts in order to reduce our exposure to the UK market.</p>  <p>  For example, the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia has been used, inter alia, to provide targeted advice to individual companies as well as to conduct a market prioritisation exercise which is now informing our approach to market diversification activities, including the choice of destinations for Trade Missions.  Trade Missions play an important role in this regard, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia 2018. These missions included participants from across the agrifood sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  These and the other missions that my Department has under consideration for 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  Indeed, since the UK referendum I have increased Bord Bia&rsquo;s funding by a total of &euro;19.5 million, including a further &euro;5 million allocated in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  Product diversification has also been supported through additional funding of &euro;8.8 million to Teagasc to develop its National Food Innovation Hub, and funding to support investment in the prepared consumer foods sector. </p>  <p>  My Department is also taking other direct, practical actions to support the sector&rsquo;s market diversification efforts, for example through a seven-point Market Access Plan, which includes the allocation of more departmental resources to market access work, an online portal through which essential information across a wide range of markets can be centrally accessed.

The long-term policy vision for the agricultural sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production as referred to in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. </p>  <p>  In the agriculture sector we have focussed strongly on improving the efficiency of Irish farming which is key to reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. There is clear recognition in Food Wise 2025 that the continued growth of the sector must be on the basis of sustainable intensification. I firmly believe that we can contribute to GHG mitigation objectives while safe guarding our food production by continuing to make improvements in areas such as:</p>  <p>  - Animal breeding strategies</p>  <p>  - Grassland management</p>  <p>  - Nutrient management</p>  <p>  - Animal health and welfare</p>  <p>  - Feeding strategies that maximise the efficiency of our grass based production system.</p>  <p>  My Department and its Agencies are actively involved with the farming sector and continue to invest heavily in a number of schemes and measures to help farmers reduce their carbon footprint while also enhancing output. Such schemes include the Green Low Carbon Agri Environment Scheme (GLAS) programme and which specifically include actions to support climate mitigation; the Beef Data Genomics Programme, which actively supports breeding improvements in our national Suckler Herd and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes which provides Capital grants for technology and capital investment generating greater efficiency. As an example of my continued focus on encouraging mitigation action at farm level I have recently launched a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot scheme that builds on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme with a funding provision of &euro;20m in 2019.</p>  <p>  Innovation and technology will also play an increasing role in supporting the sector to deliver on the sustainability agenda; we are already seeing how technology is being used for calculating the carbon footprint of farms and in other areas such as grass measurement.</p>  <p>  We are continuously looking ahead; increased environmental ambition will be a key element of CAP Post 2020. As we look towards defining the measures and targets under the new CAP regime the recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of abatement measures we need to focus on with a view to achieving the 2030 targets.</p></reply>

In 1996 there were approximately 500 deer farms with 20,000 deer in Ireland, but numbers have declined sharply since that time. </p>  <p>  Today there are only a small number of farmers in Ireland actively supplying deer for meat production, which cater primarily to specialised niche markets. The sector is reliant upon producers and companies ensuring that a market exists for their product, an objective which Bord Bia assists in by identifying and developing potential market outlets. </p>  <p>  There was some recent growth in the Irish market during 2016 for example with around 764 deer slaughtered for this market, but this declined to 271 deer for 2017, and only 185 for 2018. </p>  <p>  Growth in the past was achieved as a result of improved distribution for game meats, especially in supermarkets. Game and exotic meats historically occupy a premium, niche segment of the meat market. Whilst there are opportunities to compete with the larger premium segment of the red meat/poultry categories, it is important to note that demand is seasonal, with the greatest concentration of retail shelf space dedicated to game in the Winter/Christmas period. </p>  <p>  My Department has approved one factory for the slaughter of deer in Ireland, and two game handling plants. There may also be outlets for processing of venison in Local Authority approved plants, but this would be a matter for the Local Authority concerned.</p></reply>

CSO estimates of dairy exports in the January-November 2018 period (latest available) show that they increased by 2.8% in volume compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.</p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish dairy exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the dairy sector, as evidenced by the objectives set out for the industry in Food Wise 2025. Food Wise 2025 outlines the potential for growth in dairy exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  The long-term fundamentals of the global dairy market are strong, with growing global demand projected from fast developing countries with increasing middle classes and more westernised diets. Whilst significant challenges have continued throughout recent years, in particular price volatility, there is confidence that the Irish and EU dairy sector is well placed to gain from the opportunity presented by expanding global demand.</p>  <p>  Both business and retail customers for Irish dairy products will continue to demand that the Irish dairy industry operates to the highest standards of food safety, environmental sustainability and animal welfare. In addition to the high standards by which Irish dairy farmers operate, we need to credibly verify these standards to the satisfaction of our international customers. Programmes such as Origin Green and the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme, the Dairy Sustainability Ireland Initiative as well as environmental schemes under the Rural Development Programme demonstrate our collective commitment to environmental sustainability.</p>  <p>  My Department and I, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, will continue to play a key role in building the market opportunities for Irish dairy, for example through trade missions, inward and outward technical visits and inspections, and other trade facilitation and promotional activities.</p></reply>

Crops including horticulture, contribute approximately &euro;700m annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices.</p>  <p>  The cereals sector is a major contributor of high quality grain to the feed industry, provides grain for the food and drinks industry and a key source of seed production.  Cereals are therefore a significant stakeholder in our agrifood industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint and an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is vital.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that cereal production has experienced difficult challenges in recent times. In relation to cereal markets, Ireland accounts for approximately 1% of EU production, however grain prices are affected by global market price shifts and particularly events such as last summer&rsquo;s drought. It is not possible to predict the price of grain for the 2019 harvest at this early stage. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide significant supports to the sector. In 2017, I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme including the tillage and horticulture sectors. As a further support, the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment with over &euro;7.3 million distributed to tillage farmers to date. Early last year I announced that the EU Protein Aid Scheme was extended for 2018, resulting in over &euro;2.8m being paid to growers to date.</p>  <p>  In August 2018 I announced a &euro;2.75 million fodder production incentive measure for tillage farmers to encourage growers to participate in the fodder market. I am pleased to say that there was very positive engagement from growers with over 19,600ha of catch crops grown.   </p>  <p>  My Department also provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry, in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme, which provides invaluable information to growers on the latest varieties available. </p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is exploring the development of novel markets for cereal products seeking to improve competitiveness and sustainability with Irish malting barley demand increasing with growth in demand for Irish whiskey.</p>  <p>  I am committed to this important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agrifood industry. </p></reply>

Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.</p>  <p>  The Small Business food sector is segmented into Artisan, Established, Startups and In-Growth types. Approximately  500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services.

The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas. Key features of this policy include setting Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quotas to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015, where possible, and in all cases by 2020 as well as a discards ban (Landing Obligation) to be phased in over the period 2015 to 2019.</p>  <p>  Setting fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is an essential aspect of the policy. Fishing opportunities are agreed on an annual basis at the EU Fisheries Council of Ministers on the basis of a proposal produced by the European Commission that is informed by the best available scientific advice. The Common Fisheries Policy specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  To achieve this, the FMSY exploitation rate shall be achieved for all stocks by 2020 at the latest. This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.</p>  <p>  Scientific information on the state of the fisheries exploited by the Irish fleet is compiled by the Marine Institute and is published in the Stock Book each year. The most recent Stock Book, 2018, contains 74 stocks that are subject to the scientific advice of the Marine Institute. From the 74 stocks, 32 are assessed as being sustainably fished in 2018. This number has grown every year since 2013. This in turn leads to the number of stocks being over fished declining from 22 in 2014 to 16 in 2018.</p>  <p>  The 2018 December Fisheries Council, at which quotas for 2019 were agreed showed a rebuilding of many stocks. I was pleased that the scientific advice supported large increases in a number of stocks of importance such as Haddock (+20%), Hake (+28%) and Megrims (+47%) in the Celtic Sea. The overall increase of 30% in whitefish quota will provide improved fishing opportunities for whitefish fishermen all around our coasts. This shows that the many years of intensive, industry led conservation measures are paying off.</p>  <p>  At the same time that the sustainability of our fish stocks is improving year on year, we are facing considerable uncertainty for our fishing industry arising from Brexit.  Like all sectors a &lsquo;no deal outcome would be the worst possible result for fisheries but I remain optimistic, while preparing for all eventualities, that such an outcome can be averted.</p>  <p>  Provided we can successfully navigate the potential difficulties arising from Brexit, in cooperation with our EU27 partners, I am confident that we will be able to ensure the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processors, thereby supporting the families and communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.</p></reply>

It aligns the strategic growth plans of the Organic Sector with the broader Foodwise 2025 Strategy for Irish food and drink.</p>  <p>  The overall strategic objective  is to develop a consumer led viable Organic Food Sector in Ireland enhancing the sustainability credentials of Irish food which will produce a wide range of organic products to meet increasing domestic and export market opportunities.  To this end, this Strategy sets measurable strategic objectives for each sub-sector and incorporates actions considered essential to further support the industry&rsquo;s development and achieve growth targets.</p>  <p>   A public consultation process provided an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the development of the new strategic plan. The public consultation process combined with an Organic Processing Survey ensured that stakeholders had their views considered, before the finalisation of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Minister of State Doyle is currently in the process of establishing an Implementation Group to ensure we deliver on the actions within the new Strategy.  It is anticipated that this group, which will comprise of organic sector stakeholders, will hold an initial meeting in the very near future to drive this Strategy and ensure that the Irish Organic Food Sector realises its full potential in the coming years.</p></reply>

My Department has a dedicated Data Protection Unit in place since November 2015, which has been promoting Data Protection and GDPR awareness since its inception.  This Unit actively informs all staff of their obligations under GDPR, utilising our internal communications systems, circulating easy read guides, FAQs, updates via email, poster campaigns, targeted Data Protection seminars and training courses.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware equally of its responsibilities arising from the Animal Health and Welfare legislation.</p>  <p>  The person named was recently the subject of a regulatory herd test under the Animal Health and Welfare (Bovine Tuberculosis) Regulation SI 58/2015.  The results of this test meant that it was necessary for my Department to withdraw the freedom to trade status from the herd of the person named. A Department official in seeking to contact the person named to inform him of this finding, identified that the number recorded on the Department&rsquo;s Corporate Customer System was no longer in use by the person named. Disease control is a paramount responsibility of Department veterinary officials and therefore the official concerned deemed it essential, in this instance, to obtain the most up to date contact details of the person named to ensure the prevention of any unnecessary spread of disease.  </p>  <p>  The official, mindful of data protection requirements, ensured that no personal data passed from my Department to the third party from whom the number was obtained. Advice sought from the Irish Data Protection Commission confirmed this was acceptable in the circumstances as set out above. The details were used only in this instance.  </p>  <p>  The Data Protection Officer of my department has written to the named person, outlining the steps taken by the Department official in this incident and informing the person named that it would be advisable for him to update his contact information with my Department.</p></reply>

This staff complement has significant experience in developing and implementing climate and energy policy at international, EU, national, regional and local levels. In addition to its own staff, the Department also has access to scientific and technical advice in agencies under its aegis to assist it in delivering the Government&rsquo;s climate policy objectives.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the competent authority in Ireland for the preparation and annual publication of official inventories and projections of greenhouse gas emissions, and for reporting this data to the European Union and to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Oireachtas receives a summary of the most recent inventory and projections prepared by the EPA each year in the Annual Transition Statement, which I am required to prepare and submit in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p>  <p>  The EPA also provides a range of expert scientific and technical advice on climate change to the Government. The EPA supports the Department in representing Ireland at relevant meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The EPA also undertakes a number of climate-related research and awareness activities, including the provision of support for the delivery of activities under the National Dialogue on Climate Action. The EPA also produces, in accordance with its statutory mandate, a quadrennial State of the Environment Report which provides an integrated assessment of the overall quality of Ireland's environment, the pressures being placed on it and the societal responses to current and emerging environmental issues. The last such report was published in 2016, includes a specific focus on climate change, and is available from the EPA&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The Department is also supported in the delivery of its policy objectives for the decarbonisation of the energy sector by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). In addition to the delivery of a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of the Department, the functions of SEAI include the preparation of national energy statistics and projections. SEAI also undertakes national energy modelling functions, informed inter alia by data collected from the various schemes and programmes that it administers. </p>  <p>  SEAI had a total of 91 staff as at the end of December 2018. EPA had a total of 410 staff at that time. While it is difficult to fully disaggregate the number of EPA staff working on climate issues, the EPA estimate this at 32.</p>  <p>  The work of both EPA and SEAI inform, in turn, the wider work of the Technical Research and Modelling (TRAM) Group, which provides the overall framework for the provision of technical capacity to Government Departments for climate action policy development and implementation. </p>  <p>  TRAM was established on foot of a Government Decision in 2015 and its membership comprises technical experts from relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In addition, representatives of externally contracted bodies providing modelling and analytical support may participate in TRAM meetings. To date, these services have been provided by ESRI, UCC, UCD and EnvEcon. TRAM is chaired at Assistant Secretary level in my Department and reports to the Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which is chaired at ministerial level. </p>  <p>  TRAM performs a number of functions in support of climate, air and energy policy development processes for this Department and for a number of other Government Departments and Agencies:</p>  <p>  -  implementation of a rolling work programme of technical analysis and research required, inter alia, in order to further the process of identifying the most cost effective transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy in the context of climate, air and energy policy;</p>  <p>  -  provision of a clearing house for the development of climate, air and energy policy in other related technical areas such as the EU ETS, air quality, and the application of fiscal instruments; </p>  <p>  -  acting as a focal point for technical information flow between relevant Government Departments and Agencies on issues of a technical and economic nature; and </p>  <p>  -  providing a resource for the engagement of the necessary external expertise to undertake the modelling, analysis and research required. </p>  <p>  The climate-related work of the Department is also supported by the climate information platform, Climate Ireland, which comprises a website www.climateireland.ie and other resources to assist with climate adaptation planning in Ireland. Climate Ireland was originally developed under the EPA research programme on Climate Change and the EPA currently manages the operational platform with expert support from six staff members in the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy (MaREI), based in UCC. The platform provides decision makers with a one stop repository of climate specific information, data and knowledge to support planning for the impacts and consequences of climate change and supports the Department through their work with the key sectors in preparing sectorial adaptation plans as required under the National Adaptation Framework. The Climate Ireland team also play a pivotal role in helping to build capacity and knowledge of climate related matters across all the sectors including Local Government and it is fully intended that Climate Ireland will continue to function as a long-term operational support for climate action in Ireland.</p></reply>

The primary remit of my Department in relation to littering is to provide the legislative framework, which is then managed and enforced principally by the Local Authorities.   The latest figures available from my Department&rsquo;s National Litter Pollution Monitoring System, a system designed to monitor the extent, severity and composition of litter nationally, demonstrate that the litter situation is generally continuing to improve across the country. It is vital that communities, businesses and Local Authorities in towns all across Ireland, work together to manage waste properly and to combat litter.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges presented by littering, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach, incorporating public awareness and education as well as effective enforcement. In this context, my Department supports a number of national anti-litter initiatives including the Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme, the National Spring Clean, the Projected Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) Project, the Green Schools Programme, the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) Anti-Litter League, as well as negotiated agreements with the banking and chewing gum industries. </p>  <p>  The Department funds these initiatives through the Environment Fund, for which the 2019 allocations are currently under consideration. These initiatives empower those in our communities to tackle the challenges littering creates across our country. </p></reply>

Each registered contractor is required to undertake all works for which grant support is payable in accordance with the technical specifications of the scheme, demonstrate their tax compliance and insurance cover and cooperate with the scheme&rsquo;s Quality Assurance (QA) programme.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions of the Better Energy Homes Scheme are in place to ensure the transparent administration of public monies. Achieving this requires that the processes and systems are clear and efficient and operate in a manner which is fair to all parties. SEAI has a responsibility to apply a prudent, practical and appropriate approach to the governance of the disbursement of the public funds. SEAI must also ensure that Contractors adhere to, and fully comply with the Code of Practice which can be found on their websitewww.seai.ie/resources/publications/Code-of-practice-technical-Specification.pdf. Details on the SEAI&rsquo;s disciplinary procedure and appeals process is also available on their website: www.seai.ie/resources/publications/Better-Energy-Homes-QADP.pdf.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.   The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve and will also enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel. The construction market is currently under pressure to deliver new homes as well. </p>  <p>  The measures offered under the scheme are currently being reviewed again in light of new Building Regulations coming into force later this year. Any works carried out under the scheme will need to comply with the requirements set out under those regulations, while also taking account of the budget available to the scheme.</p>  <p>  While homes that previously received works under the scheme are not currently eligible for a second visit, consideration will be given to revisiting these properties later in 2019, where feasible and appropriate.</p></reply>

However, the default position is that Green Cards are required for vehicles entering the EU from Third Countries, unless the EU Commission declares otherwise. </p>  <p>  If the UK were to exit the EU without a deal, the default position would be that Green Cards would be required for EU-registered vehicles entering the UK and for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU.  While the Government remains of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU - including avoiding the necessity for Green Cards - is the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the EU and the UK, the Government recognises that it is prudent to plan for the possibility of a 'no deal' exit.  </p>  <p>  The motor insurance industry is therefore behaving prudently in being prepared for the possibility that Green Cards will be required, even though this is not a desirable outcome.   In line with the current expected Brexit date of 29th March 2019, insurers and insurance brokers have indicated that they will begin issuing Green Cards to policyholders from March if no agreement has been reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit or the process has not been further delayed.  At that point anyone who plans on driving their Irish registered vehicle in Northern Ireland or Britain should contact their insurer or insurance broker one month in advance of their expected travel date to ensure they receive their Green Card in sufficient time.</p></reply>

It goes without saying that cycling as a mode of transport is environmentally friendly and increasing its mode share is of course an ambition of Government and in that regard I welcome the increasing popularity of cycling as a mode of transport.  </p><p>I am delighted to say that the increased levels of funding Government is making available in 2019 will facilitate the commencement of construction of a number of significant cycling projects in both the Greater Dublin Area and beyond, which will be of great benefit to all once completed and will encourage more people to choose cycling as their preferred mode of transport.</p></reply>

That Act provides for regulating the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry including taxis, hackneys and other similar activities. The Act requires the holding of an SPSV licence for the vehicle and also one for the driver, in order to carry passengers for hire or reward. The regulatory regime places no quantitative restriction on the number of licences in place. </p>  <p>  The regulatory regime requires drivers to be Garda vetted, to have demonstrated knowledge both of industry standards and of the areas in which they will be working, to have a vehicle meets specific safety standards, to have appropriate insurance in place, and to operate to an appropriate standard of service, within a pricing system. </p>  <p>  The focus of the regulatory regime is to protect the consumer and to help personal safety. These are important objectives and central to how the SPSV industry is operated and regulated. Within this context, there is also a need to evolve and be open to new technologies and innovation. In this regard, there is now widespread use of technology in the SPSV industry, and such innovations are of benefit to both consumers and operators.</p>  <p>  As regards the rural areas, the Deputy will be aware that the NTA has responsibility for providing integrated local and rural transport. This includes responsibility for the Rural Transport Programme which now operates under the "Local Link" brand. The number of services has been expanded in recent years and spending on the programme has increased substantially also. In recent months, the NTA has been conducting a pilot scheme to test evening and night-time services as part of the Rural Transport Programme. This pilot was recently extended and future arrangements will be informed by an evaluation of its experience.</p></reply>

Under this programme it is open to local authorities to seek funding for works which can assist in reducing vehicle speeds and improve road safety.

The measures announced as part of Budget 2018 formed part of a trend in continued growth in early years investment.</p><p>The increase in supports I announced in April 2017 represented a major step towards accessible, affordable and quality ELC and SAC after decades of neglect and under-investment by successive Governments. These increases reflect my ambition to support quality ELC and SAC services with appropriately supported staff. </p><p>These increases were considerable, up to 50% in the targeted subsidies, which significantly decreases the amount of payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.</p><p>As part of the Government policy to make ELC and SAC more affordable,  I introduced a universal childcare subvention payment, in September 2017, of up to &euro;20 per week (up to &euro;1,040 per annum) for families using eligible ELC providers for the care of children aged from 6 months to the first eligible point of entry of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. </p><p>These changes are waypoints towards our goal to deliver genuine affordable, accessible, quality ELC and SAC. My Department is also progressing with the wider Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) Project.  </p><p>The ACS is a radical new approach to how we deliver accessible, affordable, high quality ELC and SAC to families in Ireland. The scheme will open to applications in October 2019, with payments flowing from November 2019.  Its launch will mark a milestone in our quest to transform Ireland's ELC and SAC system from one of the most expensive in the world into one of the best.</p><p>When introduced, it will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents. It may be accessed by all families and not just those working or studying full time. International reports have stated that ACS will significantly address affordability for lower income families and, for example, Ireland will change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for ELC and SAC for lone parents, to 11th position. </p><p>In the last 4 years, the DCYA has increased funding for ELC and SAC by 117%. This has doubled the number of children accessing subsidies.</p><p>Under the ACS, all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;60,000 will be able to claim income-based subsidies, an increase of 26% to the original threshold.  The scheme&rsquo;s lower income thresholds have also been adjusted, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a net annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (the previous proposed threshold stood at &euro;22,700).  The increase in the lower threshold is important in terms of benefitting the people at the lower end of the income spectrum, by &lsquo;poverty proofing&rsquo; the scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. For those above the net income threshold of &euro;60,000, but with a child under 3 in regulated childcare, the scheme will continue to make up to &euro;1,040 per annum available.  These increased thresholds will mean that thousands more families will benefit from the new Affordable Childcare Scheme once launched at the end of 2019 and will see their childcare costs tangibly reduce.</p><p>The recently launched Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, First 5, identifies an action to develop and introduce a new funding model for early learning and care to support improved quality of provision, whilst also improving affordability for parents. </p><p>As part of the development of a new funding model for Early Learning and Care, mechanisms to control fees charged to parents will be explored.</p><p>This new approach will complement the Affordable Childcare Scheme, launching in October 2019, to subsidise the cost of provision for parents and the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) which provides for a fully funded provision for 15 hours per week for children in the two years before they begin primary school.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-06a.520.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019020600077#WRJ03100"><p>It should be noted that the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) is a two year pre-school programme. There is no routine provision for a third year which may not be in the best interests of a child and may lead to breaching the statutory school starting age.</p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time ECCE operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible so, therefore, an allowance was made. Their ECCE place was split over two years, e.g. a child may have availed of three days ECCE provision in year one and two days in year two. In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been overage for ECCE in the latter year, an overage exemption was granted.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this provision of an overage exemption by my Department for the ECCE programme was never intended as a mechanism to delay a child&rsquo;s entry to primary education or to address any issue of non-availability of a school place. In the past, the operation of the system of overage exemption has caused confusion where some parents and providers have incorrectly believed that an overage exemption approval from the DCYA represented a derogation from age requirements attaching to the statutory requirement that a child attend primary school before the age of 6 years.</p>  <p>  The overage exemption process has recently been the subject of a consultation process and a report was produced by the National Disability Authority (NDA). Officials from my Department are now considering policy options following on from this report. The new policy will consider the future of the system of exemptions and how best to support parents and children in the important transition from pre-school to primary school. It is worth stressing that the only rationale underpinning these considerations is what is in the best interests of the child. There are no funding or other considerations whatsoever. I would also note that research shows broad agreement that it is in the best interest of the child to start school with their peers.</p>  <p>  As regards the specific case you have raised, I would stress that each application for an exemption is considered on its own merits and never in the context of the outcome of any other case.</p>  <p>  In this instance, the application was declined on the basis that the full two year ECCE entitlement had already been availed of and with regard to the fact that the child named would be over age 6 years starting school. A key finding of the NDA report, which will be published in the near future, is that generally it is in children's best interest to enrol in primary school with their peers and to transition to becoming a teenager with their peers.</p>  <p>  The report also seeks to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). We will be happy to assist the family, if requested, to make contact with the NCSE to ensure that adequate preparations are in place for the child to start school in September 2019. The family should make immediate contact with their local school to make sure it has appropriate arrangements in place to support this child from September 2019.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, there was no dedicated funding for this scheme for a number of years due to constraints on public expenditure.  However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country and I reintroduced the LIS in September 2017 and allocated a total of &euro;17.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads that year.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, I allocated almost &euro;21 million for LIS roads in two phases.</p>  <p>  It is clear that there is a continuing demand for LIS funding in rural communities across Ireland, and I have therefore secured an allocation of &euro;10 million for the scheme in my Department's Vote for 2019.

Where the administrator of a pension scheme or a life company is unable to trace a member using their own resources they can use my Department&rsquo;s host mailing service.  Following discussions between my Department, the Pensions Authority and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, a revised protocol was put in place in October 2013.  The protocol sets out the Department&rsquo;s requirements for organisations using the host mailing service.  The pension provider must have made an unsuccessful attempt to contact the scheme member.  The Department will forward letters to the last known address of the member based on its records if this address differs from that which the pension provider has.</p>  <p>  From 2013 (relating to the 2012 tax year), P35 returns from employers are collecting the Pensions Authority reference number of any scheme operated by the employer to which the employees contribute.  The collection of this data will, in time, facilitate a linkage of an employee&rsquo;s PPSN with the reference number(s) of the scheme of which they were a member. </p>  <p>  There is currently no tracking service in Ireland that will allow deferred scheme members to trace their pension entitlements.  Such a system is likely to be costly to establish.  My Department&rsquo;s meetings with industry have indicated that in many cases they can find owners of funds through their own searches or by utilising the Department&rsquo;s host mailing system.  As such, they may be reluctant to take on the costs of providing information and maintaining data in a tracking service at this stage.</p>  <p>  My Department does not collect data on the value of unclaimed private pension funds.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and the tenant.  The Department has no contractual relationship with the landlord and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social or criminal behaviour.  </p>  <p>  Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 tenants are obliged not to behave within a dwelling, or in the vicinity of it, in a way that is anti-social.  Landlords are obliged to enforce the tenant&rsquo;s obligations, and may seek termination of a tenancy due to a tenant&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour.  </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the Department with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.   </p>  <p>  The strategic goal of returning rent supplement to its original purpose; that of a short-term income support, has been primarily facilitated by the introduction of the HAP. The &ldquo;Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness (July 2016), reiterated in the &ldquo;Housing First National Implementation Plan 2018-2021&rdquo; (September 2018), is to provide 87,000 flexible housing supports through the HAP and Rental Accommodation Scheme between 2016 and 2021. As part of this commitment will be the transfer of those out of rent supplement with long term housing needs to HAP with a targeted completion date of these transfers by the end of 2020.

This information is available on the CSO website at</p><p>.</p><p>My Department does not collate data on BER statistics or collect BER data in relation to social housing homes. However all dwellings, including social housing, must comply with building regulations. Current regulations require a typical dwelling to have a BER of A3 and 98% of all new dwellings are, indeed, built to this standard. </p><p>The Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) performance for new dwellings represents an improvement in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of 70% over 2005 standards and requires renewables on all new dwellings. This is typically equivalent to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of A2. The draft regulations and accompanying technical guidance to implement this have completed public consultation and the regulations are expected to be signed into law shortly. These regulations will also require that where Major Renovations take place which are greater than 25% of the surface area of the dwelling, the dwelling should achieve a cost optimal performance where feasible. This is equivalent to a B2 building energy rating for a typical dwelling.</p><p>Local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social housing homes. Funding of some &euro;128.7 million has been provided from 2013 to end-2018 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 68,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020.</p><p>The insulation retrofitting programme is being implemented in a number of phases. Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties. Phase 2 of the retrofitting programme focuses on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing homes with solid/hollow block wall construction. </p><p>The budget allocation for social housing energy efficiency works in 2019 is &euro;25 million.  My Department is currently working with the local authorities regarding their work proposals and related funding requirements for 2019, following which allocations will be made.  The number of social homes to be targeted in 2019, and for subsequent years, will depend on the work proposals and priorities submitted from the local authorities, and the available funding.</p></reply>

Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.</p><p>- A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.</p><p>- The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.</p><p>The State commemoration programme for 2019 commenced with engagement by my Department on the marking of the centenary of the Soloheadbeg Ambush of 21 January 1919. Tipperary County Council supported a community-led commemoration on Sunday, 20th January, as part of a broader commemorative programme across the county to mark the centenary of the Independence Struggle. My Department collaborated with the local authority to support these plans, in accordance with the most recent guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations.</p><p>I also approved a grant allocation of &euro;10,000 to assist the local authority in supporting the local commemorative committee and wider community in developing their plans, in recognition of the significance of the Soloheadbeg Ambush as the generally accepted first action in the War of Independence.</p><p>Significantly, on the same day of the Soloheadbeg ambush, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann was convened for the first time and a centenary commemoration of this milestone in the formation of the State was led by The Houses of the Oireachtas with the delivery of a diverse and inclusive public engagement programme which can be accessed at .</p></reply>
