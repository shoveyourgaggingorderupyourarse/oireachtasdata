Public information campaigns were also used to communicate with citizens on the supports being made available by Government to get through the pandemic. Campaigns have taken place across national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms. The centralised approach adopted is helping to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend and consistency and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns and to those hard to reach audiences.</p><p>My Department also incurred expenditure during the period 2011-2021 on a wide range of public information campaigns which have been as set out in previous parliamentary replies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-10a.36.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000073#WRC01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 64 together.</p>  <p>  The compliance scheme for tyres and waste tyres was introduced in 2017 and is operated by Repak ELT. Under the scheme, any tyres which have incurred the visible environmental charge (vEMC)  are collected free of charge by Repak Elt through registered waste collectors.   I understand Repak Elt has no records of tyres on which the charge has been paid subsequently being delivered to any farmers for use in silage storage purposes.</p>  <p>  Tyres held on farms for silage storage purposes are considered historic and predate the introduction of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for tyres. The vEMC would not therefore have been applied to them. Recognising this issue, and in advance of the introduction of the scheme, my Department provided &euro;700,000 to help remove historic waste tyres from farms. The funding was allocated across numerous geographical locations and the budget was fully expended. While there are no immediate plans to run further collection events, the issue will be kept under consideration.</p>  <p>  In the case of such historic tyres, the primary responsibility for the management of this waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste, i.e. the natural or legal person in possession of the waste, or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Act 1996 imposes a general duty of care on holders of waste. A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause environmental pollution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-10a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000073#WRC01700"><p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. During the first 6 months of 2021, the approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme who have never received any upgrade works under the scheme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme.

The IPCC&rsquo;s Fifth Assessment Report confirms that, although methane has a short lifespan in our atmosphere at 12.4 years, it has a GWP of 28, meaning that it is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a century, or 84 times more potent over two decades. </p>  <p>  In relation to agricultural methane emissions, the scientific advice of the IPCC in their 2018 report, is that it is not necessary for biogenic methane emissions to reach net-zero to meet the Paris Agreement target, nor would this be an attainable goal. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless is it clear that methane reductions must be made, and also it is important to note that other harmful pollutants are also produced through agricultural activities, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) which contribute to reduced water, air, and soil quality. </p></reply>

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held its 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding multilateral agreement adopted by 196 countries with the goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees and to strive towards 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement as the multilateral mechanism to drive global climate action and is committed to addressing the climate crisis by engaging in negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement through its membership of the European Union (EU) . </p>  <p>  Ireland is contributing to the achievement of the Paris goals, which include limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees and to helping developing and vulnerable countries mitigate the impacts of climate change. We continue to play an active and constructive role in issues linked to our climate priorities with the intention of illustrating the coherency between our international climate agenda and our domestic climate ambition. Ireland is now regarded as a leader rather than laggard by our international climate peers, based on the strength of our national effort to deal with the climate challenge.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for Government and the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has committed to halving our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050 at the latest. The Climate Action Plan is how we do it. The plan underpins Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a climate neutral economy no later than 2050 and provides for a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 reaffirms the Government's commitment to delivering a micro-generation policy framework.    </p>  <p>  The pending introduction of a Clean Export Guarantee (CEG)  tariff will represent the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro-and small-scale generators in Ireland, including for community facilities. This will allow them to receive remuneration from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity exported to the grid, reflective of the market value of that electricity.</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a consultation on a draft enabling framework on 1 October which outlined the details for the introduction of the Clean Export Guarantee payment.

There is also an ability to transport any of these three units to an island on the Sligo based Coast Guard Rescue helicopter. There are currently 17 strategically placed Coast Guard units around the coast who provide cliff rescue capabilities. There has been further development of these units in recent years with the issuing of new equipment.</p>  <p>  A Value for Money review of the Coast Guard service, published in 2012, recommended the continuation of boat and shoreline rescue service and cessation of cliff training for the Bunbeg unit which is twinned with Tory Island. The strategic decision was to retain cliff rescue services in neighbouring CGUs, Mulroy and Killybegs.  The recommendation arose principally because of the non-utilisation of the cliff service balanced against the safety considerations of delivering a highly technical and intrinsically hazardous activity.</p>  <p>  The Coast Guard, having monitored the demand for cliff rescue services has noted that the level of call outs responded to by Bunbeg / Tory Island CGU does not justify the maintenance of a cliff rescue service. For a CGU to engage in a high risk activity that demands a high level of resources in terms of training time, equipment and supervision, the benefits must clearly outweigh the risks. The maintenance of a cliff rescue team has been deprioritised, thus enabling the unit to concentrate on its boat rescue and shoreline search operations, which are regularly called into action. The investment which my Department has made in the Coast Guard rescue helicopter services has mitigated some of the demands for cliff rescue services.</p>  <p>  The Coast Guard does not have unit or location specific records but continue to monitor all available data on a regular basis.</p></reply>

In doing so, the Company will focus on ensuring that Dublin Port continues to fulfil its primary role of facilitating the movement of goods.  </p><p>Dublin Port Company has indicated for quite some time its changing position with regard to cruise. They are facing significant constraints on land use due to major infrastructure construction underway to provide more port capacity in the future and the provision of space for the customs, agriculture and immigration checks post Brexit. </p><p>Since 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021, there has been a significant increase in shipping services direct to the continent from a number of ports in Ireland. In Dublin Port, these direct services are using the cargo berths that were in the past used by cruise. It is clear that once cruise traffic recommences,  Dublin Port will have reduced capacity for cruise ship visits in the coming seasons.</p><p>However, there is spare capacity in other ports particularly with Cobh having a dedicated cruise berth in Ireland. This ideally places them as alternative options for the cruise industry and creates opportunities for tourism activities on a regional basis.  </p><p>The development of a strategy to maximise the tourist potential for cruise in Ireland is a matter for the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht Sport and Media and the tourism agencies.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Scheme set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation). </p>  <p>  Assessments and appeals have recommenced from January 2021 following the approval of the Finance Act 2020.  </p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration. My officials have been carrying out preliminary work, including an examination of the main issues which will frame the scope of the review and engaging with other Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  Separately, I have reached out to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in the context of a review that was commenced in March 2020 under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review. With this in mind, my officials will work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

The full suite of measures to maintain workplace safety should be considered by employers before making any assessment as to whether knowledge of vaccination status is necessary. COVID-19 vaccination in general would not be considered a necessary workplace safety measure for many workplaces or roles. However, there may be specific employment contexts where knowledge of vaccination status may be deemed necessary, subject to a risk assessment and with reference to sector-specific public health guidance. Employers are required to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. As a result, the data requested by the Deputy is not available centrally from my department. </p>  <p>  In order to assist civil and public service organisations with their work-related obligations during COVID-19, the Civil Service HR Policy Division within my Department regularly issues Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during Covid-19, which can be found here: www.gov.ie/en/news/092fff-update-on-working-arrangements-and-leave-associated-with-covid-19-fo/. This document is regularly updated to reflect any changes in public health guidance and government policy. Section 1.1 of this document, which is based on public health advice and the Resilience and Recovery Plan 2021, provides guidance for employers in relation to who should attend the work premise during the pandemic. In line with public health advice, a cautious and careful return to workplaces should take into account appropriate attendance levels, with the use of staggered arrangements such as non-fulltime attendance and flexible working hours. Additionally the advice is that all existing infection prevention and control measures, (such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, face coverings, adequate ventilation), and working from home unless an employee&rsquo;s physical presence in the workplace is for specific business purposes, must also remain in place for individuals even following their vaccination. </p></reply>

Please refer to the HSE website for more information. The employer&rsquo;s Occupational Health service should be consulted for employees in the very high risk category, or to determine if an employee falls into this category, and to advise on whether the employee can attend the work premises. The Civil Service CMO advises that as our knowledge of COVID-19 has increased, some conditions that previously placed employees in the very high risk category now place them in the high risk category or in some instance in the normal risk category. In addition an employee&rsquo;s risk categorisation may now have changed due to vaccination and/or history of recent confirmed COVID infection&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The Office of the Civil Service Chief Medical Officer (CMO) conducts COVID -19 risk assessments when requested by the Civil Service employing organisation. This includes referrals where the employer is advised whether the employee is at general population or normal risk/higher risk/very high risk from COVID-19. This COVID -19 risk assessment follows the risk categorisation guidance developed by the Health Service Executive (HSE). The decision on the employee&rsquo;s place of work following this CMO risk categorisation is made by the employer in consultation with the employee, not the Civil Service CMO.</p>  <p>  In terms of those with a disability, requests for a remote/blended working arrangement as a reasonable accommodation should be dealt with under the usual process as employers across the Civil Service continue to provide reasonable accommodations to staff who have a disability so that they can participate and advance in their employment.</p></reply>

As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:</p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors).</p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures.</p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods.</p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities.</p><p>- For spectators, the use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events.</p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Government agreed last week to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people which enables under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead.

Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements. The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes is a matter for determination by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.5 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.4 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government supports the uptake of Irish Water's Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, which will provide water and waste water growth capacity in smaller settlements that would otherwise not be provided for in Irish Water's capital investment plan.  I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of almost &euro;100 million for this programme was approved by the CRU. Irish Water is working with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with the local authority development plans. </p>  <p>  Complementary to Irish Water&rsquo;s Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024, my Department is currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public waste water infrastructure.   </p>  <p>  I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at a national level. This report will include the analysis of a baseline survey of all rural local authorities, to quantify and qualify the number of villages and similar settlements concerned.  This process is at an advanced stage, and I will be in a position to consider the matter further in relation to these villages and similar settlements, as identified in the survey, once I have received the final report.</p></reply>

This funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authorities to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock.  </p><p>The following table outlines submissions, approvals and remediation numbers for Louth County Council for the period 2019-2021.

This will require the implementation of centrally hosted ICT system within the LGMA to support the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes which will be supported by my Department&rsquo;s stock improvement funding programmes.

Certain types of domestic violence may be covered by the definition, including behaviours directed at the person e.g. violence, threats, intimidation, coercion and harassment etc.  </p><p>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for tenancy agreements to be drawn up between the local authority and their tenants. The tenancy agreements include the condition not to engage in anti-social behaviour. </p><p>Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, including taking appropriate measures to counter anti-social behaviour. The powers of local authorities in this area were significantly enhanced by Part 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, which provides for the issuing of a tenancy warning requiring that tenants cease any anti-social activity.  Part 2 of the 2014 Act also gives local authorities the power to recover possession of their dwellings from households or individuals in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.  In addition, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 gives local authorities the power to secure court orders excluding individuals engaged in anti-social behaviour from local authority owned houses and local authority estates.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims rests with my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV rests with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role is to support the work of local authorities and NGOs who provide accommodation support to victims of DSGBV, including capital funding support for the development of new refuges.  Under Housing for All, the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) will continue to support the provision of new refuges.</p>  <p>   In terms of social housing services, in 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to housing authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The guidance is also a useful reference for service providers, highlighting where they can be of greatest assistance to their clients, covering a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.</p>  <p>  In addition, where a victim of domestic violence applies for social housing support in their own right while still a joint tenant, it is a matter for the relevant local authority to address the contractual issues arising in relation to the joint tenancy agreement. Accordingly, the household may transfer out of their existing tenancy and into a new tenancy agreement with the local authority or they may access an independent tenancy in the private rented sector utilising the various housing supports offered by the State.</p>  <p>  The guidance was introduced with the objective of supporting a partnership approach by statutory agencies in respect of the delivery of domestic violence services, particularly in relation to helping to prevent and reduce the occurrence of related homelessness and facilitating the provision of long term accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above long-term supports, a new protocol was established in 2020 between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla, whereby a victim of domestic violence can apply for Rent Supplement, which is a short-term income support, on referral by Tusla or by Tusla-funded service providers. Where an application is made, Rent Supplement will be provided for an initial three months and will not require a means test.

I recognise that there are changing work demands being placed on authorities from the strong terrestrial and marine planning legislation, and the monitoring required from development plans.  For that reason, Housing for All, refers to the need in Action 24.1 to ensure that there is sufficient resourcing to meet the scale of ambition in the plan.  In particular, reference is made to the need for planning resources to deliver an average of 33,000 units per annum, as well as the skills and resources necessary to deliver on urban regeneration and town centre first, which relate to both Planning and Economic Departments of local authorities.</p>  <p>  This requirement was highlighted at a recent meeting with Chief Executives of local authorities, and I am committed to ensuring that the resourcing is made available through the workforce planning process.   The issue goes beyond funding of posts, but also needs to deal with building new skills and increasing digitalisation of the planning service.  We have received a submissions on this wider skills and resourcing issue of planning authorities from the Irish Planning Institute, and we will be giving this matter consideration in conjunction with work to be carried out by the County and City Management Association.  I do not as yet have a timeframe for the conclusion of this work.</p></reply>

In order to begin to address this ongoing imbalance in the representation of migrants, in August 2019, funding of &euro;7,950 was approved for the Council&rsquo;s &ldquo;Migrant Electoral Empowerment Project&rdquo;, with a subsequent &euro;24,090 issued in December 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department's September 2021 call for funding to political parties directed applicants to submit proposals aimed at addressing the need for greater diversity as well as gender balance in local government. The call for funding also directed political parties to consult the Immigrant Council of Ireland&rsquo;s research &lsquo;The Experience of Migrant Candidates in the 2019 Local Election&rsquo; in making their applications. Proposals funded that specifically target minority groups include the recruitment of Diversity Officers, Diversity and Inclusion Officers, and running a party recruitment campaign targeting new members from migrant backgrounds, the travelling community and people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Similarly, for the past three years, my Department has issued an annual call for funding to all local authorities for projects that will help increase diversity in local government structures. Some of the projects funded this year that were aimed at minority groups include: &ldquo;Workshops addressing a lack of knowledge and understanding about the political system amongst minority women to increase engagement in local politics&rdquo; by South Dublin County Council and &ldquo;An awareness campaign engaging with local women&rsquo;s groups and groups representing people of diversity, highlighting the work of the council and the work of women councillors in particular&rdquo; by Kerry County Council.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department provides funding to the organisation See Her Elected (SHE), which encourages women from different socio-economic, ethnic and religious backgrounds in the rural midlands and northwest to run for local election, and to Women for Election (WfE), which is a non-partisan organisation working towards increasing diversity and gender balance in Irish politics.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland, commits to maintain the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in Housing for All are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

Deer populations by their nature are mobile and have a home range that is not constrained by landownership boundaries. These home ranges are normally defined by physical landscape features such as mountains, lakes, rivers, built up areas and availability of suitable habitat within that home range. </p><p>Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, national culls are not carried out and the only culling done is within the State National Parks.</p><p>However, deer on any lands can be controlled by the landowner once that control is in accordance with current legislation, in this case, the Wildlife Act. During the annual open season, deer can legally be shot under licence. The season operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer. My Department has received over 5,800 applications so far this season for deer hunting licences under Section 29 of the Wildlife Act. </p><p>In terms of on private property, landowners may apply to my Department for permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is deemed necessary outside the annual open seasons. These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Applications are investigated by local staff to determine if serious damage is being caused and if so, the most practical method of stopping or controlling the problem. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage. </p><p>My colleague Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and I have been in communication in recent weeks in relation to the re-establishment of a version of the Irish Deer Management Forum, where it is planned that many topics in relation to deer management will be discussed. Our Officials are currently working together to establish the structures of such a forum and further details will be made available in due course.</p><p>The following statistics are the number of deer shot under licence under Section 29 and Section 42 of the Wildlife Act for each of the previous five years. The returns are made by licence holders on an annual basis.  </p><p><b>Deer shot under licence under Section 29 and Section 42 of the Wildlife Act </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Section 29 &ndash; Deer Hunting Licence</th>       <th>Section 42 &ndash; Serious Damage Licence</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 </td>       <td>32,901 </td>       <td>2,435 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>37,241 </td>       <td>3,046 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>41,184 </td>       <td>5,416 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>44,381 </td>       <td>7,218 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020* </td>       <td>35,134 </td>       <td>4,648 </td>    </tr> </table> *2020 figure is an ongoing figure as returns continue to be collected by the NPWS.</p></reply>

There has been a steady reduction in the number of areas failing to comply with the standards in recent years. </p>  <p>  I note that the EPA appreciates that there is a long and complex programme of work ahead to deliver a waste water service that fully meets the required standards. </p>  <p>  It will not be possible to fix all infrastructural deficits overnight and this work will require very significant and sustained capital investment. These are complex projects and must be carefully planned, designed and developed to fully meet our future needs.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and waste water infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and delivery of the funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. The National Development Plan 2021-2030 (published on 4 October 2021) commits to almost &euro;6bn capital investment to be undertaken by Irish Water in the period from 2021-2025 of which over &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funded in respect of domestic water services also referenced under Housing for All.  This substantial and sustained investment will build on improvements in recent years to deliver enhanced environment conditions in our rivers, estuaries, lakes and coastal waters.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion (Current &euro;629m and Capital &euro;830m) in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This funding is provided to Irish Water for its operational and capital costs relating to the provision of domestic water services having regard to the Third Revenue Control (RC3) period 2020-2024 set by Irish Water&rsquo;s economic regulator the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p>  <p>  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area. It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure including compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.</p></reply>

I had useful exchanges on situations of concern to Israel, Palestine and Jordan in the wider Middle East region, including in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the situation in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and on Ireland&rsquo;s role as facilitator of the UN Security Council Resolution on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). I also discussed Ireland&rsquo;s thematic priorities on the Council, including on the women, peace and security agenda and on climate and security issues. </p>  <p>  The Israeli and Palestinian component of this visit included a wide range of engagements in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ramallah as well as a field visit in the West Bank. I met with key representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well officials from UN agencies, think-tanks, student groups and civil society. </p>  <p>  On the Israeli side, I met with President Isaac Herzog, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, and Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz. I had useful exchanges on a range of issues, including the issue of antisemitism and the response to Covid-19. In relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I restated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to constructive engagement on the Middle East Peace Process. I welcomed the outreach by members of the new Israeli Government with their Palestinian counterparts but underlined Ireland&rsquo;s deep concern at settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions in the oPt. I asked the Israeli government to cease unilateral actions, such as the recent announcement on settlements, which are illegal under international law and negatively impact the viability of a future Palestinian state. I emphasised the importance of civil society space and the vital role played by NGOs in any democracy, and expressed my concern at the recent designation of six Palestinian organisations as terrorist entities. </p>  <p>  On the Palestinian side, I met with Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, and Deputy Prime Minister Ziad Abu Amr. I emphasised the need for democratic renewal in Palestine, particularly in light of the postponement of the May elections  and underlined the importance of the PA assuming its responsibilities with regard to the rule of law, freedom of expression and civil society engagement. </p>  <p>  During my visit I announced &euro;2.4 million in additional support for the Palestinian people. The package includes &euro;2 million for UNRWA, which provides essential services to 5.7 million Palestine refugees in the oPt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, and brings Ireland&rsquo;s support to the agency to &euro;9 million in 2021. The remainder of the funding will support the UN in providing humanitarian assistance in the oPt, UNICEF&rsquo;s work with Palestinian children and the West Bank Protection Consortium&rsquo;s activities with threatened communities in the West Bank.</p>  <p>  I visited communities in the West Bank, accompanied by officials from the UN and the West Bank Protection Consortium, where I saw first-hand the impact that the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements are having on the local Palestinian population. I also met with young Palestinian graduates from Ireland&rsquo;s Palestine Scholarship Programme. </p>  <p>  During my visit to Amman, I had the opportunity to have wide ranging discussions with the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi, including in relation to the Middle East Peace Process. </p></reply>

The Commission proposals represent a real opportunity for Northern Ireland.  </p><p>I believe that the Protocol will work if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism. The Protocol was agreed and ratified by this British Government and they have a duty to deliver on their commitments. Article 16 of the Protocol allows either party to take safeguard measures if the Protocol is leading to &ldquo;serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties&rdquo; that are liable to persist or to a diversion of trade. Any safeguard measures taken must be restricted in scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to remedy the situation. </p><p>If either party gives notice that they are considering use of Article 16, then in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex 7 of the Protocol, both sides should immediately enter into consultations in the Joint Committee with a view to finding a commonly accepted solution. No unilateral measures should be implemented during the initial one month period. If, after a month, negotiations fail to agree a solution, the unilateral measures may come into effect. Any such action must be restricted in scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to remedy the situation. All other aspects of the Protocol will remain in place. Any unilateral measures taken will be subject to review at least every three months. </p><p>The UK has not as of yet notified the Joint Committee that it is considering taking safeguard measures under Article 16; nor is any detail available as to what such measures may encompass.</p><p>Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, the Government has dedicated substantial time and resources into preparing for a number of Brexit scenarios, including a no-deal outcome. This intensive effort across Departments and Agencies included the development of two Brexit Omnibus Acts; three Brexit Action Plans; substantial investment in the State&rsquo;s infrastructure and IT systems and the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses, all of which have contributed to the ongoing resilience of the economy in the face of Brexit. Protecting the all-island economy and ensuring the continued unimpeded functioning of North-South supply chains and trade flows has been a key priority for the Government throughout the Brexit process, and robust systems and supports remain in place to help businesses navigate the ongoing challenges caused by Brexit.  While we would never wish to see the UK Government invoke Article 16, if this does occur we will engage with all stakeholders in light of the precise scope of the measures envisaged. </p><p>I believe that any misuse of Article 16 would have serious consequences, for the relationship between the UK and the EU, for the UK&rsquo;s relationship with Ireland, and for stability in Northern Ireland. </p><p>I urge the British Government to engage in good faith with the EU on the Protocol in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

Qualified maintenance technicians are paid dependent on their current point of the scale, rate of Military Service Allowance for their rank and if they are in receipt of Technician Pay for their appointment. The salary can range from the first point of the Private 3 Star payscale, up to the top of the scale at BQMS rank and whether they joined pre or post 1994.</p><p>Payscales can be found at the following url: www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/e8132-routinely-published-information/</p><p>Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations. A new agreement &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions. Following a ballot of their members the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, namely RACO and PDFORRA, formally notified the Workplace Relations Commission of their intention to comply with this agreement. </p><p>In return for ongoing reform and productivity measures the agreement provides for further increases in pay to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. This agreement includes the following increases: </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, came into effect on 1<sup>st </sup>October 2021. </p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1<sup>st </sup>February 2022. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1<sup>st</sup>October 2022.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces.The Programme for Government provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15<sup>th</sup>December 2020.  On completion of the Commission's work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p><p>Referring specifically to the hourly rate of pay for enlisted maintenance technician's, there is no definitive figure available here. This is due to the fact that for maintenance technicians, in the Air Corps, a rate of pay depends on factors such as rank and associated pay scales, as well as related technical pay rates. In the case of maintenance technicians Tech Pay 4, 5 or 6 can be applied, but again it is not linked to an hourly rate, as asked. </p><p>The number of vacant positions for maintenance technicians in the Air Corps is currently being complied and will be provided to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

As a measure of last resort, and in the context of the uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 related absences, schools were permitted to use non-mainstream class teachers last year to provide cover for teacher absences. Due to the successful roll out of the vaccination programme and changes to the rules around close contacts and the requirements to restrict movements, teacher absences due to Covid-19 should be reduced this year. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with the education stakeholders on the issues raised about the current difficulty in accessing substitutes for teacher absences.  Among other measures, a review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution. Engagement is taking place with the base schools to make arrangements for the recruitment of additional staff immediately. </p>  <p>  In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools have been asked to combine their allocation of principal release days into clusters so as to form a full-time fixed-term post to cover each school principal&rsquo;s release days </p>  <p>  Restrictions for job-sharing teachers undertaking substitution, have been temporarily suspended which allows these teachers to work additional days if available to cover vacancies in their own and other schools. Likewise, teachers on career break can carry out substitute work without restriction in the current school year.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have been requested to be flexible with the student teachers to facilitate student teachers being available for substitution work.  HEIs have also been requested to communicate with post primary PME students to advise them of the availability of substitution in primary schools. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council have been asked to undertake a communications campaign to contact the 111,000 teachers on the teaching register to urge them to make themselves available for substitution. </p>  <p>  Teachers who may be available to undertake substitution work have been asked to register on SubSeeker.ie so that schools are aware of their availability when seeking to fill substitute vacancies. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep this matter under review in collaboration with the education stakeholders.</p></reply>

Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p><p>The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website.  </p>  <p>  The over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use.  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. This will assist in managing comfort levels in classrooms during periods of colder weather. </p>  <p>  Similarly ensuring that at the end of the school day each evening, the windows in each room are opened (as wide as is practical and safe, while also considering security issues) for at least 15 minutes to ventilate the room fully will ensure that the classrooms are ventilated from the night before and this does not need to be repeated prior to class in the morning. During this first class of the school day windows should, weather conditions permitting, be partially opened (as per guidance in this document) to keep the room fresh and prevent stuffiness and condensation etc. This is in addition to and complements the end-of-day ventilation described above.   </p>  <p>  Achieving fresh air by having a number of windows partially opened as required rather than one window fully open can help to maximise the use of window driven natural ventilation distribution across the room without causing discomfort. In colder weather any local chilling effect can be offset by partially opening the windows nearest to and above the radiators.   </p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their boilers operation temperatures are set at the recommended manufacturers&rsquo; guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school.  In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open (partially when classrooms are in use and fully when not in use) in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.   </p>  <p>  Deployment of the above measures can be supplemented and enhanced by the use of Carbon Dioxide (CO2  ) monitors. These monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with  the impact of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation within a room.  </p>  <p>  The Department considers the above practical steps and stepwise approach are sufficient to ensure good ventilation practices in school while at the same time ensuring an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort.  </p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequacies can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address enhancements on a permanent basis.  </p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  </p>  <p>  Where the above measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available.

None of these counties currently operate a Local Employment Service and therefore no Local Employment Service employees are being replaced.</p>  <p>  The Phase two procurement, to commence shortly, will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State. It will take on board the learnings of the first phase.  This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, existing service providers, including current local employment services, with their strong track record and demonstrable capacity for delivering high-quality employment services, will be in a good position to submit strong competitive tenders for the Regional Employment Service.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-10a.324.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000079#WRJ02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 to 157, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was introduced in an extremely short period of time in order to cushion the incomes of citizens following the onset of an unprecedented public health crisis. Within a month of the PUP scheme going live, over 507,000 people received at least one payment.   Recipient numbers peaked at 602,108 on 8 May 2020. My Department has processed in excess of 1.7 million applications for the PUP, from over 900,000 applicants and made almost 27.7 million separate PUP payments. The number of claims received and processed is equal to approximately 9 times a normal annual claim load. Delivering the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement. </p>  <p>  At all times during this process, my Department has prioritised prompt claim processing and payment in order to ensure that people who had to cease their employment because of public health restrictions had the security of an income support payment. In addition, while prioritising prompt payment in the circumstances of the pandemic, payment and claim processing controls were applied to reduce the risk of incorrect or fraudulent payments.  </p>  <p>  In processing claims, my Department always has to strike a balance between applying tight controls and checks on claims on the one hand and not frustrating a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a payment on the other. This was particularly the case in the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of Covid-19. Applying normal controls would have meant very long delays in processing the unprecedented number of claims received. This would have led to severe financial hardship for many people and undermined the sense of social solidarity that was required to sustain the public health restrictions and combat the virus.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these concerns a range of controls were implemented and while not as extensive as would normally be the case the controls did help to reduce and control the level of incorrect payments. For example, in the initial two months to end April 2020 the Department processed some 900,000 PUP claims, with around one third of these being rejected for failing to meet the control criteria.  Controls on PUP have continued to be enhanced over the last eighteen months, with a wide range of control work undertaken, including matching against Revenue records.  </p>  <p>  Overpayments can arise as a result of a statement or representation which was, to the knowledge of the person making it, false or misleading in a material respect or by the willful concealment of a material fact by a claimant, or by new facts or evidence which have come to light since a claim was made. It will be appreciated that a very high threshold of proof must be met to warrant a finding of fraud. </p>  <p>  Up to the end of October 2021, my Department has recorded 15,023 overpayments of the PUP totalling &euro;29.3 million, with &euro;10.2 million recovered to date. Of these figures, 443 cases, totalling just under &euro;1.5 million, were attributed to fraud.  Typically, overpayments have arisen where a person has failed to declare ongoing employment or where the person was not working prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  All claimants for the PUP were required to confirm the date on which they last worked as part of the application process. Where this date predated the introduction of Covid related restrictions, their claim was rejected. In addition, from June 2020, all claims were checked against Revenue records to verify a history of previous employment. In a situation where a significant proportion of private employments were closed due to public health restrictions, along with the fact that claim inflows closely tracked the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions, it was reasonable to accept self-declaration as the basis for a loss of employment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in addition to those who are fully unemployed, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance is also payable to individuals who work on a part-time basis. Many of those individuals lost their employment in exactly the same manner as the rest of those in the labour force and were entitled to claim PUP. In total, out of over 900,000 applications for PUP, just over 36,800 cases involved individuals who were claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance as part-time workers prior to their PUP claim.  Payment of Jobseeker's Allowance ceased from the date of the award of the PUP payment in these cases. There is no evidence which suggests that persons who were in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance prior to the pandemic applied successfully for the PUP once the pandemic started with the exception of the part-time workers just referenced.</p>  <p>  In common with many social welfare payments, the PUP is not payable in respect of periods where a person is absent from the State. However, in line with the practice in relation to Jobseeker payments, a person may avail of a limited absence from the State of up to two weeks in a calendar year.  My Department carries out a range of checks to identify cases where an individual may no longer be in the State and takes appropriate follow up action. However, the volume of identified cases does not support a reliable estimate of the overall number of such cases.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all schemes, the Department is continuing take steps to identify overpayment cases and to seek refunds and will do so in a measured way.  Control activity and work on the recovery of overpayments on the scheme will continue into next year.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is expected that each accommodation centre will be inspected three times in 2021, twice by QTS and once by IPAS officials.</p>  <p>  In addition, accommodation centres are contractually bound to provide menus that reasonably meet the dietary needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated at the centre. Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. All accommodation centres that offer catered options must provide three meals per day and must have a range of snacks and non-alcoholic beverages readily available.</p>  <p>  IPAS is always available to deal with any complaints from residents and residents are encouraged to engage with IPAS if they are unhappy with any aspect of their accommodation. Where a complaint is significant in nature or a resident is not comfortable raising a complaint with a centre manager, they may make the complaint directly, or through a representative authorised to act on their behalf, to the IPAS Customer Service Team. </p>  <p>  All residents have access to an independent support helpline operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service and funded by the Department. IPAS is working to facilitate clinics at centres, in line with public health restrictions. IPAS has no role in determining a resident&rsquo;s claim for international protection. Decisions on claims for international protection are matters for the Department of Justice. Residents can freely make complaints without any implications for their claims for international protection.  </p>  <p>  As I mentioned above, accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by IPAS/IPPS and by an independent inspections company. Inspection reports are published on www.gov.ie/en/publication/534c2-ipas-inspection-reports/.</p>  <p>  As you might expect, vulnerable adults and children are of considerable concern to me. Thus, IPAS has services in place to highlight such situations immediately. Everyone who registers an application for International Protection is offered a vulnerability assessment. Where an application includes children of an applicant, IPAS, with parental consent, also assess their vulnerability in an appropriate manner. All applicants are advised that they can contact IPAS to discuss their needs at any stage of the IP process, even if a vulnerability assessment has previously been conducted. This helps ensure that vulnerabilities that may later arise are identified in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  All assessments are carried out in a sensitive, conversational manner with gender-appropriate officers and interpretation as required. Appropriate training is provided to all IPAS staff involved in the assessments.     </p>  <p>  I trust that this information can provide the necessary reassurance to you that the Government is committed to the welfare of all residents of our accommodation centres.</p></reply>

It is expected that each accommodation centre will be inspected three times in 2021, twice by QTS and once by IPAS officials. </p>  <p>  In addition, accommodation centres are contractually bound to provide menus that reasonably meet the dietary needs of the different ethnic groups accommodated at the centre and the reasonable prescribed dietary needs of any person accommodated at the centre. Menus must include a vegetarian option and all food products provided must have a traceability system that complies with food safety requirements. All accommodation centres that offer catered options must provide three meals per day and must have a range of snacks and non-alcoholic beverages readily available. </p>  <p>  IPAS is always available to deal with any complaints from residents and residents are encouraged to engage with IPAS if they are unhappy with any aspect of their accommodation. Where a complaint is significant in nature or a resident is not comfortable raising a complaint with a centre manager, they may make the complaint directly, or through a representative authorised to act on their behalf, to the IPAS Customer Service Team.  </p>  <p>  All residents also have access to an independent support helpline operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service and funded by the Department. IPAS is also working to facilitate clinics at centres, in line with public health restrictions. IPAS has no role in determining a resident&rsquo;s claim for international protection. Decisions on claims for international protection are matters for the Department of Justice. Residents can freely make complaints without any implications for their claims for international protection.   </p>  <p>  Accommodation centres are subject to regular unannounced inspections by IPAS/IPPS and by an independent inspections company. Inspection reports are published on www.gov.ie/en/publication/534c2-ipas-inspection-reports/. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed in the Programme for Government to ending the current system of Direct Provision within the lifetime of the Government. As you are probably aware, on 26 February of this year, I published the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a new International Protection Support Service. Through the White Paper, the Government is committed to ending the current system by the end of 2024 and replacing it with a new system centred on a humanitarian not-for-profit basis.</p>  <p>  I trust that this information can provide the necessary reassurance to you that the Government is committed to the welfare of all residents of our accommodation centres.  </p></reply>

Similar and in some cases more restrictive residency criteria apply in other Member States and jurisdictions e.g. in the UK a student has to be resident for the three continuous years immediately preceding his/her commencement in college. In Denmark, a student has to be resident for a minimum of five years prior to commencing studies. </p>  <p>  The three out of five year rule takes cognisance of students who wish to take time out to travel or work abroad. Such students can still meet the residency requirement if they have not been outside the State for more than two of the previous five years. </p>  <p>  It is also possible for students, who did not meet the residency requirement at the commencement of their studies, to have their eligibility reviewed if they meet the residency requirement during the course of their studies.</p>  <p>  Alternatively a tuition student who meets the residency requirement in a Member State, the UK, EEA or Switzerland and satisfies the nationality requirements may be eligible for a fee grant. There are no plans to amend the current eligibility criteria. </p></reply>

Staff delivering courses are typically employed by the relevant community group or association and the terms and conditions approved for Local Training Initiative (LTI) co-ordinators is a matter for their employers.   </p>  <p>  In March 2002, the Labour Court recommended that LTI Community Training Co-ordinators should receive an increase in pay and that the total grant paid to project sponsors for co-ordinator pay should be increased by 20%, with sponsors being advised that the total increased grant, less employers PRSI, should be paid to co-ordinators.  The recommendation also stated that for future pay increases, the co-ordinators should have a pay relationship with and be &lsquo;linked proportionally&rsquo; to Community Training Centre (CTC) Managers.  Any benefit to the co-ordinators arising from the pay relationship should be paid in accordance with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was in place at the time.  </p>  <p>  Since then, LTI Community Training Co-ordinators have received increases under national agreements, in line with CTC Managers.   The salary increases arising from the implementation of the Public Service Stability Agreement  2018 &ndash; 2020 provided for the restoration of pay which was reduced as a result of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts (FEMPI).   Neither CTC Managers nor LTI Co-ordinators were covered by the Public Service Stability Agreement as they are not public servants and did not have their pay reduced under FEMPI. </p>  <p>  SOLAS has submitted a pay increase proposal under Building Momentum 2021-2022, for CTC Managers and LTI Co-ordinators to my Department which is currently being examined.</p></reply>

SOLAS is working to develop a strategy to support the Climate Action Plan and associated skills training at further education level. SOLAS&rsquo;s strategy on green skills is in development and they are actively engaging across a very broad range of internal, external and industry stakeholders to ensure tangible and appropriate FET responses are devised.</p><p>In the higher education sector, in addition to core education delivery, funding is provided under Springboard and the Human Capital Initiative to incentivise the delivery of programmes which support the development of professionals in areas such as building analysis and climate adaptation; sustainable building technology and retrofit, conservation and sustainability. Two innovation projects have commenced under the Human Capital Initiative (Pillar 3). These projects are directly supporting increased availability of skills development in the construction sector through the Digital Academy for Sustainable Built Environment (DASBE) in Limerick IT and the REEdl project in IT Tralee which is based on a world leading model of self-directed, project centric learning using Virtual Reality and Augmented reality (VR/AR) in supporting the education of student engineers along with access to world class research centres</p><p>Under Springboard+ 2021/22, there are 17 courses available in green skills and sustainability such as Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB), Bio-Energy, Clean Technologies and Electric Vehicle Technology. Please see details of all the green skill and sustainability programmes running across the Higher Education system contained under Springboard in attachment 2. </p><p>Skillnet Ireland also supports the construction sector through two national Construction-specific Skillnet training networks, as well as through multiple regional Skillnet training networks that assist construction businesses located in their respective regions. CIF and Skillnet Ireland, launched the Construction Professionals Skillnet in January 2020 to provide customised learning and development solutions to meet the specific professional learning needs of the construction industry. Programmes are currently available in areas such as Communications, Project Management, Sustainable Construction, Contracts and legal responsibilities. The Construction IT Alliance (CitA) Skillnet also facilitates the advancement of construction firms through digitalisation and the development of skillsets that enable businesses to adopt new and emerging information and communications technologies. The network primarily supports architecture, engineering, construction, and operations enterprises within the construction sector and has provided programmes such as Advanced BIM Management and a Higher Diploma in BIM over the last 12 months.</p><p>">Advanced Cert</p><p>">Post Grad Diploma</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided the following update in relation to the Dublin Probate Office.</p>  <p>  Applications by solicitors continued to be processed throughout the pandemic. The waiting time for solicitor applications at present in the Dublin Probate Office is eight to ten weeks assuming that the papers received are correct. Applications where queries had to be raised on foot of the papers first lodged are taking eight weeks from the date they are re-submitted.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service advises that the reintroduction of restrictions on travel earlier this year necessitated the temporary closure of the personal applications process in the Dublin Probate Office.  Interviews for personal applications resumed in May with additional resources allocated to facilitate these interviews.  I am further advised that any arrears that had been built up have now been cleared and the waiting time for personal applications at present in the Dublin Probate Office is also eight to ten weeks. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has embarked on multi-year programme of modernisation to enhance the delivery of services to the people of Ireland. As part of its aims for the programme, the Courts Service is committed to simplifying services and processes. A key project in the civil law workstream for the Service is the development of an e-probate project, which will have the benefit of standardising the processing of probate applications and so enhance the delivery of the service to Courts Users.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p>  <p>  Since the International Protection Act 2015 commenced on 31 December 2016, the International Protection Office of my Department has carried out the function of considering permission to remain (under section 49 of the 2015 Act), in respect of those applicants who have been refused international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection)  at first instance. </p>  <p>  In the permission to remain element of the process, each case is given a detailed consideration on its individual merits under all of the prescribed headings. This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, humanitarian factors, as well as consideration of a person&rsquo;s work situation, among other issues, before a decision is taken to grant or to refuse permission to remain.</p>  <p>  All applicants refused international protection have a right to appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT) who must consider if the earlier International Protection Office (IPO) determinations on refugee status and subsidiary protection should be affirmed or set aside.</p>  <p>  Where the IPAT upholds the IPO recommendation to refuse international protection, and if permission to remain has also been refused by the IPO, the applicant can make submissions for consideration as part of a formal permission to remain review by my Department. </p>  <p>  This review is in place to provide for situations where an applicant&rsquo;s circumstances may have changed in a material way since the initial decision was made to refuse permission to remain. Any decision taken to grant permission to remain under the review mechanism can only be made once the international protection appeal has been refused by the IPAT.</p>  <p>  The IPAT has no role in the consideration of permission to remain either at first instance or under the review mechanism. I understand that my officials have engaged directly and intend to follow up in writing with the information sought in that engagement.</p></reply>

The new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. </p>  <p>  In parallel with this, the Department has committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development, and the sustainable employment of home care workers into the future. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. The Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process which involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and which includes the Department of Health.  </p>  <p>  The most recent review of the occupation&rsquo;s lists announced on 27th October and the preceding review, announced on 14 June did not recommend that home care workers be removed from the ineligible list. There is evidence of other factors driving the sector&rsquo;s difficulty in attracting workers, such as the contracts of employment and terms and conditions being offered, failure to guarantee hours, and the lack of travel and subsistence payments. It is noted that in the submissions provided by the sector that approximately 75% of staff in home care roles are employed on a part-time basis. </p>  <p>  Home care workers are currently on the Ineligible Occupations List and in order to have an occupation removed from the ineligible list, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to skills and labour shortages in Ireland and the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  </p>  <p>  Removing Home Care workers from the ineligible list will not address the workforce challenges in the home care sector.  A longer-term approach is required to address these challenges and my Department is committed to working with relevant stakeholders to seek to address these issues.</p></reply>

This legislation encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy.</p>  <p>  Publication of the AHR Bill is a priority for my Department and the Government, and a commitment to enact this legislation is included in the Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;. This Department will continue to engage intensively with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this complex legislation. </p>  <p>  The draft Bill does not contain provisions to regulate surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions. Issues which arise from the undertaking of surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions concern areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. My Department is engaging with the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in respect of these matters. Officials in my Department have met on a number of occasions with different groups within the umbrella organisation to which you refer.   </p>  <p>  Overall, the provisions outlined within the Bill will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight.  </p></reply>

It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the Housing for All Strategy (action 19.7). This removed a disincentive against the sale of properties that might otherwise remain vacant.</p>  <p>  As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the Housing for All Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties "in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people". It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. </p>  <p>  The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any future changes are appropriate; to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and other government departments continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

That is why, in the interim, all student nurses and midwives on paid internship placement will be provided with an additional support of &euro;50 per week of internship placement (a modification of the Pandemic Placement Grant to support the educational requirements during their placements, equivalent to 50% of the full Grant). This equates to &euro;1,800 over the duration of their paid internship. This will take effect from 1 January 2022, the same date as paid internships for the current academic year are due to begin. This proposed interim measure will be put in place while work is underway to develop those detailed proposals to give effect to the recommendation relating to intern pay, within the established processes to progress pay matters.   </p>  <p>  It is important that we support our student nurses and midwives to undertake their clinical placements. I am grateful to Mr McHugh for undertaking this important piece of work as it has helped my consideration of how we can best support our student nurses and midwives as they continue their undergraduate education.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-10a.628.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000086#WRQ02000"><p>As the Deputy is aware, CORU is Ireland's multi-profession health and social care regulator. CORU&rsquo;s role is to protect the public by regulating the health and social care professions designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). The Act seeks to protect the public by providing a system of statutory registration for designated health and social care professions. There are two forms of application to CORU; applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State and applications for registration. </p>  <p>  Where a health and social care professional qualifies outside the State and applies to register in Ireland, they must apply for the recognition of their qualification. Once a complete file has been submitted to CORU, a decision must issue within four months. Currently there is no waiting list for such applications. Nevertheless, CORU continues to innovate to shorten timeframes for these applicants.</p>  <p>  In respect of applications for registration, CORU has informed my officials that the average processing time for an application for registration is 9.2 weeks for new applicants entering a profession. This represents an improvement on the previous average of 14 weeks. </p>  <p>  I met with the Chairperson and CEO of CORU earlier this year and raised the issue of timeframes for recognition of qualifications and registration. Following our discussion, a variety of measures have been initiated by CORU aimed at further reducing timeframes.  CORU has informed my officials of two innovations that will further improve these processes. Firstly, applications for the recognition of qualifications received outside the State are now accepted for all professions through an online application system, which launched this year. Secondly, CORU has commenced the contemporaneous processing of recognition and registration applications. Once an applicant submits an application for recognition an invitation to initiate a registration application to run in parallel is issued. These initiatives, in addition to additional resources I have allocated to CORU, are anticipated to further reduce timeframes.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a number of opportunities for innovation and change have been identified by CORU, some are already underway, while work is beginning on others. For example work is underway to assess alternative approaches to facilitate recognition of EU qualifications which would reduce timeframes and CORU has also commenced a project to facilitate the digitisation and integration of all registrant related systems. </p>  <p>  My department will continue to support CORU in achieving its strategic vision and improving timeframes for all applicants into the future.</p></reply>

The Act provides, amongst other things, that CORU is a legal entity in its own right. As such CORU is an independent body, with the power to charge certain fees and has the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all of its legal obligations.  </p>  <p>  The Act intends that the regulation of health and social care professionals be a self-funded activity. Consequently, certain fees are charged for registration as a professional and for associated services on a cost basis. The annual registration fee was set by CORU at &euro;100 and along with other fees, is required to enable CORU to carry out its statutory obligations to protect the integrity of the practice of the Health and Social Care Professions it regulates and to protect the public. This approach to funding professional regulation is mirrored across professions within the State and internationally.</p></reply>

Moving funds into one scheme will mean reducing the funding available for another. All elements under the Direct Payments ceiling including convergence are inextricably linked and it is challenging to examine them in isolation. </p><p>My Department continues to engage with farmers and our EU colleagues in analysing the effects of all the proposed changes, including changes to convergence. The outcome of these continued discussions and the results of these analyses assist the decision-making process on the implementation of new CAP regulations in Ireland.</p></reply>
