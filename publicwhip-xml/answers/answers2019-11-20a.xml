    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000069#WRA01000"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the State has a legal obligation to offer accommodation, food and a range of other services (including utilities and healthcare etc.) to any person who claims a right to international protection in Ireland while their legal claim is being examined. These services are demand led and generally it is difficult to predict demand far in advance.</p>  <p>  I am advised that as of 10 November 2019, there were 6,052 persons being provided with accommodation by my Department in the 39 accommodation centres located nationwide. </p>  <p>  Due to an unexpected rise in applications (up 60% to date this year), these centres are at full capacity, therefore a further 1,523 persons are residing in 37 emergency accommodation locations in hotels and guest houses. Every effort is being made to re-accommodate applicants in emergency locations to a dedicated accommodation centre as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  To meet the associated increase in demand for accommodation, my Department has initiated two processes to source additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  Firstly, we have sought expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in providing accommodation and related services to people in the international protection process. Premises assessed as suitable under this process may be offered a short-term contract (usually one year).</p>  <p>  Secondly, we have run procurement competitions through the Government's procurement portal, Etenders, on a regional basis throughout the country to procure accommodation. These contracts will be longer term with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to reducing the length of time applicants spend in the international protection process, and has introduced a number of measures aimed at achieving this.</p>  <p>  The International Protection Act, 2015, introduced the single procedure process for the determination of protection applications. The aim of the single procedure process is to help reduce waiting times significantly by considering all elements of a person's protection claim together, rather than sequentially.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of other measures have and are being taken including increases in staffing levels at the International Protection Office (IPO) and a new streamlined system for processing Safe Country of Origin (SCO) cases.</p>  <p>  An applicant who applies for international protection today can expect to receive a first instance recommendation/decision within approximately 15 months, provided no complications arise. Prioritised cases are being processed in just under 9 months. Prioritised applications include those from countries such as Syria and Eritrea and from especially vulnerable groups of applicants, such as unaccompanied minors. My Department is working hard to try to achieve target of 9 month in the vast majority of cases.</p>  <p>  I can also say that my Department has, in conjunction with a number of charities and NGOs who were awarded funding for projects, assisted a total of 675 people to transit from state provided accommodation to permanent homes in the community. This figure relates to the period from the beginning of the year to the end of October.</p>  <p>  My Department also secured an additional &euro;1m in Budget 2020 for  Immigration Service Delivery which includes provision for additional staffing to fast-track applications thus reducing pressure on Direct Provision.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, court hearings could not continue at the courthouse in the short term. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service is undertaking condition surveys of approximately 65 courthouses nationwide. In view of the circumstances in Carndonagh, priority has been given to this courthouse and I understand that the survey was carried out on the 30th October 2019. However, the Courts Service await the structural report from this review before any decision can be made on works to Carndonagh Courthouse.</p>  <p>  I understand the sitting of Carndonagh District Court which sits once per month has been transferred to the nearest Courthouse, Buncrana Courthouse, just under 20 kilometres distance from Carndonagh. Carndonagh District Court will continue to sit in Buncrana Courthouse until the review is complete. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000069#WRA01600"><p>I appreciate the deeply harmful effects which cyberbullying can have on persons who experience that or other harmful online behaviours.  These experiences can be devastating for those concerned.</p>  <p>  In that context, I welcome the successful conviction last week in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court of a man for a sustained campaign of harassment conducted against a number of female journalists and writers.  It is important to see successful use of the criminal law in such cases, as I am conscious of the potential for a chilling effect in relation to these matters, including in particular for women and female candidates for election.</p>  <p>  A whole-of-government response is appropriate to addressing these complex issues.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Online Safety 2018 - 2019 identifies a range of positive actions to address online safety issues, including cyber-bullying.  There is a general consensus that the appropriate response to addressing such online issues is one that encompasses educational and awareness raising campaigns, as well as effective actions and policies on the part of internet companies.</p>  <p>  In relation to harassment laws specifically, the Deputy may be aware that the Law Reform Commission published a report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety in 2016 which recommended a number of legislative changes in order to deal more effectively with the negative aspects of increased use of online communications.</p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations outlined in this report were provided for in a Private Members Bill sponsored by Deputy Brendan Howlin - the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017. To ensure that legislation in this area can be enacted as swiftly as possible, I and Government as a whole agreed to adopt and amend that Bill. </p>  <p>  Government in May of this year approved the approach to be taken in that regard, and my Department is now engaging closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Council to draft amendments to the Bill, to ensure consistency in its provisions and that the law in this area is robust and effective.</p>  <p>  These amendments will result in a Bill which will modernise the laws in relation to sending threatening or abuse messages, introduce a distinct offence of stalking and provide for two offences to deal with non-consensual recording and distribution of intimate images.  The amendments will also remove some of the civil provisions in the Bill that may be more appropriately dealt with through proposals to establish the Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner, currently being examined by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  It is my intention that these amendments will be completed and introduced at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  Finally and as the Deputy will be aware, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality has been examining these issues, having invited written submissions from stakeholders and subsequently held public hearings throughout October on the issues of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  I look forward to receiving the Committee&rsquo;s report on this matter and will examine it closely as we continue to progress our legislative proposals in this field.</p></reply>

He is joined by representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Probation Service, the Courts Service and my own Department.</p>  <p>  The review is examining the adequacy of measures available to protect vulnerable witnesses during the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, to help ensure the best quality evidence is available to the jury in making their decision, while respecting the dignity of the victim and their right not to be re-victimised by the investigation or trial process itself.</p>  <p>  It will examine the entire legal process around sexual offences, from the initial reporting of an offence through to the end of any court proceedings. The review is particularly concerned with the treatment of complainants and vulnerable witnesses throughout this process.  This Government remains committed to tackling the scourge of sexual violence, in all its forms and to supporting victims. Examining the experiences of victims is vital to that aim.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference encompass a broad range of issues and I understand that the working group has received a large number of submissions.  It is important that these complex and sensitive issues are considered carefully and I understand that the review is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  While the outcome cannot be pre-empted, I look forward to its recommendations.  Any such recommendations will be given careful consideration alongside the recent work of the Law Reform Commission on knowledge and belief concerning consent in rape law which I have welcomed.  My overall goal in this exercise will be to provide for implementation of any recommendations which may be of assistance in supporting victims and vulnerable witnesses, while of course respecting the necessary fairness and balance inherent in our criminal justice system.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000069#WRA02400"><p>I very much welcome the publication of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s Report on knowledge and belief concerning consent in rape law.As the Deputy may recall, the report was prepared by the Commission in response to a reference from the then Attorney General, on behalf of the Government. </p><p>The report is a thorough and expert examination of this complex issue and I can assure the Deputy that my Department is closely examining its recommendations with a view to bringing forward amending legislation. </p><p>It is important to understand the context of the report.</p><p>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has been widely recognised as a landmark piece of legislation dealing with consent and exploitation in sexual activity. For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.</p><p>The 2017 Act also set out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.  </p><p>In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.</p><p>1. Sexual intercourse must have taken place;</p><p>2. the person must not have consented; and</p><p>3. the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.</p><p>During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused honestly believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented would not be found guilty of rape.</p><p>It was on foot of those debates that the Attorney General and my predecessor as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Commission's recently published Report recommends a change in the law to state that the belief of the accused person in consent must be reasonably held. It also touches on some of the surrounding matters which are being examined elsewhere, such as rape myths and stereotypes, obstacles to prosecution in rape cases, the treatment of victims in rape cases and other related matters.</p><p>The timing of the Commission's report is particularly welcome, given that the review of protections for vulnerable witness in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, chaired by an expert barrister Tom O&rsquo;Malley, is due to be completed by the end of this year.  </p><p>I intend to consider these two sets of recommendations in tandem and I therefore have asked my officials to examine the Law Reform Commission's Report in detail with a view to bringing forward proposals to implement its recommendations.  Any recommendations which may arise out from the O&rsquo;Malley review group and which may be of assistance in supporting victims and vulnerable witnesses will feed into this process, while of course maintaining the necessary fairness and balance inherent in our criminal justice system. </p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters and the distribution of personnel across the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of Garda&iacute; and Probationers allocated to each of the Cork divisions is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have reviewed the details of the Cork workforce and I would point out that the number of Garda members and staff in all of the Cork Divisions has increased over recent years.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. We currently have approximately 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff. And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff.  </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in 2014, approximately 2,800 probationers have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties nationwide. Another 200 Garda&iacute; are due to attest at the end of this month. Of these probationers, 138 have been assigned to the Cork Divisions. </p><p>As of 31 October 2019, which is the most recent data available, there are 700 members in Cork city Division, 335 in Cork North and 304 in Cork West.  Taking account of retirements and departures, there are now 114 additional Garda&iacute; across the Cork Divisions since the end of 2015, representing an overall 9% increase in Garda members across all the Cork Divisions since the end of 2015. </p><p>These Garda members are supported by 160 Garda Staff, which represents a 50% increase in the Cork area since 2015. This increase in Garda staff levels supports the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative to operational policing duties, where their training and expertise can be used to best effect.</p><p>With regard to retirements, I am advised by the Commissioner that projected departures are kept under continuous review and that the level of recruitment is adjusted as necessary in order to maintain the desired strength.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the retirement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by law, which sets the mandatory retirement age for all members at 60 years of age.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 50 years of age once they have served at least 30 years and those who joined on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 55 years of age with 30 years service. Garda&iacute; have the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60, subject to the Garda Commissioner being satisfied that they are fully competent and available to undertake their duties.</p><p>I am informed that there have been a total of 39 retirements in the Cork Divisions during 2018 and 2019.  The following table sets out the number of members who retired on a Voluntary, Compulsory or a Cost Neutral Early Retirement basis in each Cork Division in 2018 and 2019, as provided to me by the Garda authorities.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Cork City</th>       <th>Cork  North</th>       <th>Cork West</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 (as of 15 November</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>39</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

To meet the associated increase in demand for accommodation, my Department has initiated two processes to source additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  Firstly, we have sought expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in providing accommodation and related services to people in the international protection process. Premises assessed as suitable under this process may be offered a short-term contract (usually one year) which will help to meet demand while the regional tender process is rolled out nationally.</p>  <p>  Secondly, we have run procurement competitions through the Government's procurement portal, Etenders, on a regional basis throughout the country to procure accommodation. These contracts will be longer term with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. </p>  <p>  It is open to accommodation providers to offer premises both through the expressions of interest process or the tender process.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of offers received is now underway. It is anticipated that the evaluation process for the Western region will now conclude by mid December 2019.  For the purposes of the tender, the Western region covers Galway, Mayo and Roscommon. Until the evaluation is complete, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on the possible location of any new centres.  When the evaluation and commercially sensitive aspects of the process are completed, my Department will begin engagement with local communities and their political representatives.</p>  <p>  My Department currently has a network of 39 accommodation centres across 18 counties and there is positive engagement between residents and local communities in all cases including through the Friends of the Centre Groups. These Groups promote integration across the communities and are a valuable support to residents and to centre managers and staff.</p></reply>

There is close ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies who all work closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.  </p><p>As I have outlined in the Houses previously, the existing multi-agency cooperative arrangements in place to tackle cross-border crime are already quite structured and successful.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2015 the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the <i>Fresh Start </i>agreement, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force which is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK Revenue and Customs.  A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also closely involved.</p><p>The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational actions.  In this format, the senior management level of the two police services provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  </p><p>The Task Force has had some notable success in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime.</p><p>The regrettable absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland means that the work of the Task Force is less visible than it might have been.  It was designed to report to Justice Ministers north and south and it is my hope that the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland will allow the Task Force to reach its full potential. </p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and PSNI. </p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that the collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was recently extended with establishment of the first ever AGS-PSNI Joint Investigation Team involving Eurojust. This is a very significant and positive development will further strengthen the already close and positive cooperation between police services on the island of Ireland. </p><p>Finally, I would assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work in addressing cross-border criminality and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform this critical role. The Northern region continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.</p><p>Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 35% over the past 3 years, with the result that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p></reply>

Report Stage is currently awaited. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Bill is to provide transparency on the gender pay gap.  The Bill provides for the making of regulations requiring employers to publish gender pay gap information. The regulations will initially apply to firms with 250 or more employees but, over the next few years, this would be reduced to 50 employees. Information on differences in bonus pay will be among the data, which must be published. The regulations will apply to the public sector as well as the private sector, subject to the employment thresholds. </p>  <p>  It is intended that mandatory reporting will incentivise employers to take measures to address the issue insofar as they can. </p>  <p>  Measures such as those included in the Bill have been taken in a number of other countries and, indeed, EU member states were encouraged to take such measures in an EU Commission Recommendation of 2014.     </p>  <p>  The other gender pay gap measures in the National Strategy for Women and Girls include initiating dialogue between union and employer stakeholders on the matter, increasing understanding of the gender pay gap and its causes and developing practical tools to assist employers to calculate the pay gap within their organisations.  </p>  <p>  Tackling this issue is good for equality and it also makes good business sense, as firms that can report a low or non-existent gender pay gap will have an advantage in recruiting future employees. Initiatives to address the gender pay gap can also be expected to have a positive impact on disparities in income for women across and after their working lives.  </p></reply>

Further, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe that a convicted offender poses a serious risk to the public, it can apply to the courts for a Sex Offender Order under s.16 of the 2001 Act.  A Sex Offender Order can prohibit the offender from doing anything the Court considers necessary, in order to ensure that the public is protected from serious harm.</p><p>In terms of legislative reform, I can confirm that the General Scheme of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill was developed by my Department following a comprehensive review of current law and administrative practice. The General Scheme was approved by Government<b></b>in June 2018 and it is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Bill is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. My officials and that Office are working together to finalise the draft with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible. </p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.  While the drafting process is not yet complete, the main provisions are expected to include:</p><p>- Stricter notification requirements including requiring offenders to notify Garda&iacute; of their address upon release from custody, or any subsequent change of address, within 3 days as opposed to the existing 7 days.</p><p>- Provision to allow for fingerprinting and photographing the offender, where necessary to confirm their identity.</p><p>- Enhanced supervision of high-risk offenders, including, in limited circumstances, the electronic monitoring of offenders subject to post-release supervision orders.</p><p>- The placing on a legislative footing of assessment teams to assess and manage the risk posed by sex offenders.</p><p>- Provisions whereby a court can prohibit a sex offender from working with children.</p><p>- Provision for a statutory basis for the necessary disclosure of information relating to a high-risk offender on the &lsquo;sex offenders register&rsquo;. The information in relation to an offender which may be disclosed include the name, address and threat posed by the offender. It is intended that the disclosure would only be made to the minimum number of people necessary to avert a serious risk to safety.</p></reply>

In particular, we discussed the rise in radical propaganda messages which have contributed to a rise of the risks associated with right-wing extremism.  </p>  <p>  While it is not the practice to comment in detail on security matters, I can inform the Deputy that the security services here in Ireland are vigilant in this regard.  The threat level, including any emerging threats, is kept under constant review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in consultation with the Defence Forces, utilising all of the expertise available and working continually with their EU and international counterparts to identify and manage threats.     </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, last month the Garda Commissioner and Minister of State David Stanton launched the new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Diversity and Integration Strategy, 2019 &ndash; 2021. The three year programme has a significant focus on enhancing the identification, reporting, investigation and prosecution of hate crimes.  This Strategy recognises the existing and emerging diverse composition of our communities, and aims to protect all minorities and diverse groups in society and sets out a working definition of hate crime in line with best international practice and the McPherson "perception based test&rdquo;.  My Department is currently engaged in a wide-ranging public consultation on the incitement to hatred legislation with a view to bringing forward amendments in the context of hate crime legislation early next year.  </p>  <p>  A new Anti-Racism Committee will also shortly be established, with a mandate to examine what needs to be done by public sector bodies as well as the wider community to challenge racism.</p>  <p>  In relation to direct provision, the reception system for international protection applicants operates under a whole-of-Government approach with a view to ensuring the best outcomes for residents as well as for local communities. It is not just a question of providing accommodation for vulnerable people. It is a suite of services provided by a number of Government Departments including Health; Education and Skills; and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. There has been much commentary in recent weeks about the system.  There has been debate too, about the location of centres, which I welcome.  However, I would appeal for it to be thoughtful, respectful and factual.  As I mentioned in my statement to this House last Wednesday night, far-right anti-immigrant activists are paying close attention, seeking out opportunities to incite fear and hatred &ndash; as far-right groups have done throughout history.  It is incumbent on all those of us in public life to demonstrate real support for asylum seekers and refugees and for the local communities who welcome them.</p></reply>

This model has long been recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI).  Rollout of this model meets a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>I understand from the Commissioner that the aim of the Model is to reduce bureaucracy and increase the numbers of frontline Garda&iacute;, and in this way improve policing services provided to communities nationwide.  The new model is also expected to increase community engagement and expand access to a wider range of specialist services across the country. </p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner a number of considerations were taken into account in developing the new model and the restructuring of Divisions, including population, geography, projected growth, crime trends and workload across a range of work streams. </p><p>While new to Ireland, this model is the norm in other countries.  It will reduce bureaucracy and shift real decision-making power from Garda Headquarters to the Chief Superintendents, closer to the communities they serve.</p><p>I am informed that Divisions will be typically made up of approximately 600 to 800 personnel. This will ensure each Division has the resources and skills to deliver a wider range of community policing and specialist services based on the demand in their area.  I understand that under this model, each Division will consist of the following hubs:</p><p>- Community Engagement</p><p>- Crime</p><p>- Performance Assurance</p><p>- Business Services.</p><p>I understand that the new model will be implemented on a phased basis throughout 2020.  The first five Divisions where the new Model will be implemented, are Galway, Cork City, Dublin South Central, Meath/Westmeath and Limerick.  </p><p>In terms of Garda resources nationwide, I would point out that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation &ndash; there are now approximately 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff and 470 Garda Reserves. </p><p>I am confident that this ongoing investment in Garda resources together with the ongoing reform process will result in an improved policing service for all communities, urban and rural, now and into the future. </p><p>Detailed information on the Garda workforce is available on my Department's website at </p><p>For more general information on Garda facts and figures, the Deputy may also wish to see the information on the link below: .</p></reply>

Therefore, the Irish Prison Service has no control over the numbers committed to custody at any given time.</p>  <p>  The number of spaces available on a given day can be less than the capacity figure as cells may be unavailable for different reasons such as repairs and maintenance.  Furthermore, where local management assess a prisoner as being unsuited to share a cell for reasons of vulnerability or propensity to violence, a cell designated as being operationally suitable for two prisoners may, temporarily, house only one prisoner.</p>  <p>  Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, the Irish Prison Service makes every effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers to manage the available space and structured Temporary Release. Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case by case basis and the safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Irish Prison Service to ensure a safe working environment for staff and the safety and security of prisoners in our custody, and a number of short and medium term steps to address the issue of increasing prison numbers.</p>  <p>  I am advised that plans are advanced for the re-opening of accommodation not currently being used within the system, including the re-opening of the Training Unit which will provide approximately an additional 96 spaces.</p>  <p>  In addition, an audit of existing accommodation is underway, in order to identify where additional spaces can be brought on stream with the potential to provide in excess of an additional 100 spaces. A major project is also underway in Limerick for the construction of a female prison, as well as a new wing to Limerick male prison. Together, this will provide 158 new spaces.</p>  <p>  I can further advise the Deputy that there has also been progress in providing alternatives to custody, including the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011, which requires a sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 also provides a number of alternative sanctions for the courts to reduce the need to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of fines. </p></reply>

This approach is aligned with the Divisional-focused Garda model. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) specifically called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation. An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard. While the Commissioner has indicated that he does not support industry funding of Garda units, he is open to considering other industry-funded proposals to combat insurance fraud. </p>  <p>  It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide Divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud. Over a number of years, the GNECB and the Garda Cyber Crime Bureau (GNCCB) have delivered training courses to Garda members engaged in economic crime-related investigations, across all Garda divisions. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Training College and University College Dublin (UCD), GNECB and GNCCB have offered an accredited course to over 40 members a year, drawn from all Garda Divisions, as well as from specialist units engaged in the investigation of economic crime.  Representatives from the private sector, including the insurance industry are invited to contribute to the course, thereby providing specialist insight into relevant insurance sector-related topics.  On completion of training,  successful candidates are awarded a Post Graduate Certificate in Fraud and E-Crime Investigation from UCD. </p>  <p>  More recently, each Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Division has been requested to provide information regarding the extent of insurance-related fraud. This information is being examined at the GNECB and will be utilised to determine investigative activity, which will be undertaken under Operation Coatee. </p>  <p>  Operation Coatee was launched in April 2019, its focus being the prevention of insurance-related fraud and associated crimes on a coordinated basis throughout Ireland. In circumstances where insurance fraud has already occurred, Operation Coatee is designed to maximise the prospect of identifying suspected culprits, and, where possible and appropriate, to initiate criminal proceedings.</p>  <p>  I understand that a &lsquo;day of action&rsquo; was undertaken at the commencement of Operation Coatee on 24 April 2019.  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) engaged in operational activity associated with an investigation relating to over 20 insurance claims which have been made and which, in some cases, have already involved payment being made to claimants. Arising from the &lsquo;day of action&rsquo;, 6 high-value cars and jewellery with a value in excess of &euro;300,000 were seized, along with a substantial amount of documentation and financial records.  The evidence seized continues to be analysed. I am informed that on 15 October, Garda&iacute; arrested 5 individuals by way of follow-up to searches conducted on 24 April and that investigations are ongoing.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the manner in which Garda&iacute; are deployed.  As Minister I have no direct role in that matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a record &euro;1.76 billion was allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro;92 million this year. I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year.</p>  <p>  This investment is supporting the sustained growth of the organisation.   We currently have approximately 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff. </p>  <p>  And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest next week. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the media reports referred to by the Deputy, to the effect that on a particular date in March, only 2 Garda&iacute; were available to patrol. I can understand the concern that these reports may have caused to the Deputy, and to the people of the area.  I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that I have raised this matter with the Garda authorities and I am informed that the media reports are incorrect. I have been assured that on the night in question, significantly more than 2 Garda&iacute; were on duty and available to patrol the city. </p>  <p>  In relation to Garda resources in Cork City Division more generally, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the end of October 2019, there are 700 Garda&iacute; are assigned to the Cork City Division, supported by 95 Garda staff. Additionally, they are currently supported by 33 Garda Reserve.</p>  <p>  The additional 49 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork City Division since the end of 2015, represents an increase of 7.5%.   The increase in Garda staff numbers from 59 to 95 (equivalent to an increase of 61%) over the same period means that as well as new Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division, additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties, where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect. </p>  <p>  Taken together, it can be expected that the increase in both Garda members and staff numbers represents a real increase in operational policing hours within the Cork City Division. Nationally, over 500 Garda Members have been redeployed to frontline visible policing.</p>  <p>  In addition, the next intake of probationer Garda&iacute; will be attested on 29th November, 2019 and transfer to their training stations on 2nd December, 2019. I have been informed that it is the intention of the Commissioner to allocate eight probationer Garda&iacute; to training stations within the Cork City Division on a permanent basis. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that for December 2019, the Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 24 probationers from this class to be allocated to the Cork City Division on a temporary basis to work on Operation Open City, which involves high visibility road policing duties over the busy Christmas period. These 24 probationers will then be re-allocated after the period concerned to their permanent training stations in Divisions outside the Cork City Division from 2nd January, 2020.  </p>  <p>  These intended allocation of resources are contingent on the operational demands of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and as such may be subject to change.</p></reply>

The work underway, through a Gender Equality Action Plan, complements wider efforts towards gender equality being advanced through the Civil Service renewal process. <table>    <tr>       <th>Final Staff Nos by Gender as at 30 September 2019</th>       <th>Male total </th>       <th>Female Total </th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grade </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secretary General</td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Second Secretary General</td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deputy Secretary</td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Secretary</td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>22 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Counsellor </td>       <td>37 </td>       <td>34 </td>       <td>71 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Counsellor Higher</td>       <td>18 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>20 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Standard</td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>15 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Higher</td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Development Specialist</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1.9 </td>       <td>3.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Senior Development Specialist</td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Legal Adviser</td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First Secretary</td>       <td>60.5 </td>       <td>73.7 </td>       <td>134.2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First Secretary Higher</td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>28 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal Standard</td>       <td>19 </td>       <td>26.8 </td>       <td>45.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal Higher</td>       <td>11 </td>       <td>6.8 </td>       <td>17.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal Standard Add ons</td>       <td>11 </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal Higher Add ons</td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Professional Accountant</td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>2.8 </td>       <td>6.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Development Specialist</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>20 </td>       <td>33 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Architect </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third Secretary Higher</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>23 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Third Secretary Standard</td>       <td>62 </td>       <td>72 </td>       <td>134 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Administrative Officer</td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>2.8 </td>       <td>6.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Archivist Grade III</td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer Higher</td>       <td>11.8 </td>       <td>9.05 </td>       <td>20.85 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer Standard</td>       <td>38 </td>       <td>51.5 </td>       <td>89.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Systems Analyst HEO</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer Higher</td>       <td>13.75 </td>       <td>31.23 </td>       <td>44.98 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer Standard</td>       <td>70.6 </td>       <td>99.69 </td>       <td>170.29 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer Trainee Systems Analyst</td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer Higher</td>       <td>24.8 </td>       <td>92.67 </td>       <td>117.47 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer Standard</td>       <td>156.25 </td>       <td>290.91 </td>       <td>447.16 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cleaner </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>11 </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services Officer</td>       <td>28 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>28 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services Attendant</td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0</td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nightwatchperson </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Civilian Driver</td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Political Appointee</td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>682.7 </td>       <td>883.85 </td>       <td>1566.55 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

There have been five hearings at General Affairs Council meetings since then, in which Ireland has actively participated, highlighting the importance we attach to respect for the rule of law.</p>  <p>  Some Polish government legislation has given rise to concerns around fundamental principles of the operation of the rule of law, including legal certainty, separation of powers, shielding of the judiciary from undue influence from other State powers, and security of judicial tenure. </p>  <p>  The cumulative effect of the reforms of the Supreme Court and Judicial Council on the system of justice has been of concern. European institutions, other Member States and the international judicial community should be able to place their trust in the system of justice in all Member States. </p>  <p>  We welcome the legislative steps taken by the Polish Government to address the concerns on rule of law issues raised by the European Commission and also by Member States at the General Affairs Council. We encourage Poland to continue to engage and address the concerns that have been raised.</p>  <p>  Regarding the proposed law on sex education in Poland, this was not raised at the most recent EU Foreign Affairs Council. </p>  <p>  The proposed law was debated in the last sitting of the outgoing Polish Parliament. We note the resolution passed by the European Parliament on this proposed law which calls on the Polish Parliament to refrain from its adoption. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to advancing gender equality at the UN and other regional organisations, and in this regard supports the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and of the International Conference on Population and Development. The Beijing Platform for Action states that &ldquo;the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence&rdquo;. Central to this right is the need for universal access to quality and affordable comprehensive sexual and reproductive health information, education, including comprehensive sexuality education and health-care services.</p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor developments on this issue and on rule of law issues across the EU. </p></reply>

These concerns have been exacerbated by the passage of legislation aimed at individuals and organisations providing lawful assistance to migrants and asylum seekers.</p>  <p>  We also regret that the necessary steps were not taken to ensure the operation of Central European University in Budapest in the long term. As the Taoiseach said previously in this House, the loss of the Central European University will be a loss to Budapest and Hungary.</p>  <p>  We note that the Hungarian Government has withdrawn its legislative proposal on establishing an administrative court, which was a source of great concern with regard to the independent functioning of the judicial system in Hungary. Other judicial reforms have now been proposed by the Hungarian Government which are now under consideration by the Hungarian parliament. We hope that these reforms are also properly scrutinised with a view to upholding fundamental values and the principles of the rule of law which all EU Member States must adhere to. </p>  <p>  Article 7 proceedings were launched against Hungary on 12 September 2018. The first hearing of Hungary under the Article 7 procedure took place at the General Affairs Council of 16 September 2019.  We support the continuation of the Article 7 procedure.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for European Affairs, Helen McEntee T.D., discussed rule of law issues with Mr Szabolcs Tak&aacute;cs, then Hungarian Minister of State for EU Policies and Coordination, when they met in Dublin on 4 April 2019.</p>  <p>  At meetings of the General Affairs Council, Ireland has actively participated in discussions highlighting the importance of respect for the rule of law. The 19 November 2019 General Affairs Council included consideration of a proposal for a yearly stocktaking exercise on the state of play and latest developments regarding the Rule of Law in the EU.

It concluded that it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the required 10% margin and recommended that a new Electoral Commission be set up before convening fresh elections. </p>  <p>  On the same day, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini also released a statement calling for a new Electoral Court to be appointed that could offer guarantees of transparent elections, and also called on parties, particularly the authorities, to assume their democratic responsibilities and take the appropriate decisions to allow quick reconciliation and avoid further violence. Ireland supported this statement. </p>  <p>  Following the release of the OAS report, Mr Morales agreed to hold new elections but later in the day (10 November) resigned from his post in an effort to return stability to the country. A number of high ranking officials also resigned, including the Vice President, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, and the President of the Senate. Mr Morales took up Mexico&rsquo;s offer of political asylum and arrived in the country on 12 November. </p>  <p>  According to the Bolivian Constitution, and given the resignation of numerous high ranking officials, the next in line to take on the role of interim President is the Vice President of the Senate, Jeanine &Aacute;&ntilde;ez. Ms &Aacute;&ntilde;ez took up office on 12 November and on 13 November appointed a new cabinet of 11 Ministers. The caretaker Government now has 90 days to hold new elections, as defined by the Constitution.  Ireland, alongside EU colleagues, supports a solution that allows for the interim leadership to prepare for new elections and to avoid a power vacuum which could be seriously damaging to the country. </p>  <p>  The EU Delegation in La Paz has been actively supporting mediation on the ground organised by the local Catholic Church to help the Bolivian parties agree on a peaceful path to new elections. I have been in contact with my EU counterparts on how best to support Bolivia in the preparation of these elections. On Monday 11 November, I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels where EU High Representative Federica Mogherini updated Foreign Ministers on the ongoing work in Bolivia. This included a discussion on the possibility of a new EU Mission to the country and of how best to assist in the election of a new Supreme Electoral Court. The EU also deployed an Election Expert Mission to the country and has several projects in support of Bolivia&rsquo;s strong civil society. </p>  <p>  On 15 November, the EU released another statement calling for a return to constitutional normality so that the rule of law, democratic principles and civil rights are respected. Ireland wholeheartedly supports this recent statement from the EU which also calls on law enforcement bodies to guarantee security for the Bolivian people, while respecting human rights at all times. On Sunday (17 November), the EU Ambassador to Bolivia, Leon de la Torre, met with interim President Jeanine &Aacute;&ntilde;ez and assured her that the EU would provide support during the transition period and work to ensure credible elections. Ireland is fully supportive of this approach.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with our European counterparts to support Bolivia in finding a suitable pathway towards stability. We will continue to monitor developments through our Embassy in Buenos Aires which has a concurrent accreditation to Bolivia. </p></reply>

In the conduct of military operations, constant care must be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.This is particularly true in relation to military action in built-up areas.  I  also condemn the firing of rockets into Israel, which has recklessly endangered civilians in an indiscriminate way. </p>  <p>   I was glad to hear reports of a ceasfire, which I would encourage all parties to respect. I acknowledge the efforts of Egypt and the UN in bringing about this de-escalation. I welcome the EU statement that was issued on 12 November in response to the violence. </p>  <p>  I have given a high priority to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly the situation in Gaza, over the last two years, and have worked consistently to maintain an international focus on the issue, and support for the two state solution. </p>  <p>  I regularly discuss this situation with my counterparts in the EU and the region. For example, in February of this year I convened a small gathering of Foreign Ministers in Dublin in February, to discuss the Middle East Peace Process, and how best to encourage a move towards a just and durable peace.</p>  <p>  The Israel-Palestine conflict also featured in several of my discussions and meetings during the High-Level Week of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. In all my meetings I stressed the need for any viable solution to this conflict to respect the long-standing and broadly agreed parameters for a two-state solution, which have full EU support. </p>  <p>  Ireland has long worked to keep attention on Gaza in particular. Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in the area. I have also initiated an Irish-funded solar power project in Gaza, which will be co-located with a waste water facility and will help improve water quality in the area, and thus also quality of life. </p>  <p>  However, the roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. What is needed is the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume. Gaza faces other challenges, including oppressive rule by Hamas, but the blockade dominates peoples&rsquo; lives in Gaza to such an extent that it is difficult to address other issues. I have raised the issue of the blockade with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. </p>  <p>  I will continue to ensure that the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in Gaza remain high on the international agenda. </p></reply>

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that 25% of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, with serious health and medical needs and a severe lack of access to basic goods, services and medicines and medical care. Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in funding provided by the EU since 2018 for humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  The ongoing humanitarian, economic, social and political crisis is also having an ever-growing effect on neighbouring countries, which are hosting approximately 80% of the 4.6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants that are estimated by the UN High Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) to have left the country since 2015. It is essential that these countries are supported and the EU has responded to this need by hosting an International Solidarity Conference on the Venezuelan Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Brussels on 28 and 29 October. This conference was co-hosted by the UNHCR and the IOM, and Ireland was represented at official level. </p>  <p>  I also discussed the situation in Venezuela with the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia, H.E. Carlos Holmes Trujillo Garc&iacute;a, during his visit to Dublin in September this year. Nowhere has the impact of the Venezuelan crisis been felt more strongly than in Colombia, which has received over 1.5 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees since 2015, more than any other country. </p>  <p>  I have already authorised the deployment of two Rapid Responders to assist the UNHCR in supporting the Colombian Government&rsquo;s response to the humanitarian needs of Venezuelans in Colombia. Ireland has also contributed &euro;1 million to UNHCR towards this effort. We stand ready to assist further as the situation evolves.   </p>  <p>  I continue to firmly believe that this crisis can only have a political, peaceful, democratic solution, excluding the use of force, through the holding of free, transparent and credible Presidential elections as soon as possible. I, along with my EU partners, have regularly voiced support for the Oslo Talks process, facilitated by Norway. While these talks have now been suspended, Ireland encourages both sides to engage in good faith in an inclusive, serious and results-oriented process. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports EU efforts, including through the International Contact Group (ICG) and Special Adviser Enrique Iglesias, who is engaging with all relevant actors and stakeholders in efforts to secure and support a Venezuelan-owned solution to the current crisis. I welcome the ICG statement issued on 1 November that reaffirms the Group's view that only a negotiated transition that leads to credible elections with international observation, the re-institutionalisation of public powers, and guarantees that allow political coexistence, can bring a lasting solution to the crisis. The statement also notes that Special Advisor Iglesias will visit Caracas to engage with all relevant national stakeholders in the near future, and I look forward to receiving a report of this visit after it occurs.   </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation in Venezuela and to engage on the issue until a lasting solution to the crisis is found. </p></reply>

Details of such advertising and commercial firms that have assisted in this regard to date are as follows:</p><p><b>- Online Passport Renewals Service</b></p><p>In November 2018, my Department expanded the Online Passport Renewal Service to allow for online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a passport card for children and a wider cohort of adults eligible to renew online.  This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24/7 from anywhere in the world. </p><p>Throughout 2019 my Department ran a number of national public information campaigns which highlighted the Online Renewals Service as a fast and secure way for adults and children to renew their passports, including through advertisements on social media platforms and via print and radio channels. The success of this campaign has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications.</p><p>The direct costs of advertising to raise public awareness in this regard so far in 2019 are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p><b>- &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo;</b></p><p>The objective of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit preparedness public information campaign to date has been to ensure that key audiences are aware of the potential impact of a No Deal Brexit and the mitigation measures that they can take, with the support of Government where appropriate and with particular reference to the gov.ie/Brexit website.</p><p>My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Government Departments on this information campaign which has been underway since September 2018. Costs incurred so far during 2019 in relation to campaign activities across TV, radio, print, internet and social media platforms are outlined in Table 1 below:</p><p><b>- Rugby World Cup 2019 Consular Awareness</b></p><p>The State&rsquo;s duty of care towards Irish citizens was the pre-eminent concern of my Department during the Rugby World Cup. As the third-largest sporting event in the world, an estimated 20-30,000 Irish citizens travelled from Ireland and elsewhere to attend the tournament.  </p><p>In this context, the initial phase of the public awareness campaign aimed at an audience of rugby fans who were likely to travel to the tournament.  The goal of that campaign was to reach this core audience with messaging about the Department&rsquo;s travel advice, as well as information on what measures to take in the event of a consular emergency or crisis while in Japan. This information remained available and was updated on the dedicated Rugby World Cup page on my Department&rsquo;s website over the tournament.</p><p><b>- Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council</b></p><p>On July 2<sup>nd</sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. My Department has since continued to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing campaign through online channels and costs incurred so far in 2019 in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p><b>- St Patrick&rsquo;s Day</b></p><p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a unique opportunity to engage with the global Irish community and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the National Day of any other country.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s programme had the largest number of countries ever visited for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. The Taoiseach and I, along with 13 Ministers, 19 Ministers of State, the Attorney General, Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach visited 56 countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific region.  These programmes allowed us to promote trade, investment and tourism with Ireland, to increase visibility in new markets, and to promote our values and our influence in global institutions, notably in support of our campaign to become a member of the United Nations Security Council.It also allowed us to deepen our connections with Irish people and friends of Ireland all over the world.</p><p>Team Ireland overseas delivered a total of 1,796 events in support of Ireland&rsquo;s interest over the 2019 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period in this context. To coincide with and complement these activities, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to online promotion of an accompanying St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day video as outlined in Table 1 below. </p><p><b>- Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025 and Global Island Summit</b></p><p>&lsquo;Global Ireland&rsquo; is an all-of-Government programme which aims to double Ireland&rsquo;s impact in the world by 2025. The programme was launched by the Taoiseach and myself and Ministers Humphreys, Madigan and McEntee in June 2018 and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions in relation to how we trade, the bilateral and multilateral partnerships that we seek to build and our wider contribution to the world.</p><p>Global Ireland: Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada 2019&ndash;2025 is Ireland's first whole-of-Government strategy for the US and Canada. Its aim is for Ireland to build strong, strategic political partnerships with the US and Canada and assume a lead role in building stronger transatlantic relations. </p><p>To coincide with the programme of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day-related activities held there earlier this year, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to the online promotion of a video that outlined the Strategy&rsquo;s key objectives insofar as the US is concerned.</p><p>In July, to mark the 1st anniversary of the launch of Global Ireland programme, my Department held the Global Island summit in Dublin Castle.  At the summit it was announced that Ireland plans to double its impact in the Asia Pacific region, as part of the next phase of Global Ireland 2025. Alongside myself and the Taoiseach, Government Ministers, Ambassadors and key stakeholders spoke at the Summit.  To coincide with this event a video was produced and promoted via social media.</p><p><b>- Other Projects</b></p><p>My Department has also engaged in public information advertising via print and social media channels to build awareness of certain other initiatives and projects that relate to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy priorities and activities.  So far in 2019 these have comprised:</p><p>- Recruitment of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Cultural Director</p><p>- Promotion of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade/Irish Aid-supported Simon Cumbers Media Fund</p><p>- The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, on 28 February.</p><p>Details of expenditure in each case are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Total Expenditure for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are outlined in Table 2 below</p><p><b>Table 1: Public Information and Awareness Advertising Expenditure - 2019 to date</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Campaign/Theme</th>       <th>Supplier</th>       <th>Cost to date in 2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Online Passport Renewals</td>       <td>PHD Media, TBWA and Outsource   Media</td>       <td>&euro; 568,166.49</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready'</td>       <td>PHD Media, TBWA and Irish Times (re 12 April Brexit   Supplement)</td>       <td>&euro;1,475,537.17 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rugby World Cup 2019 Consular   Awareness</td>       <td>Outsource Media</td>       <td>&euro;28,931.39 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UN Security Council Public   Information</td>       <td>PHD Media</td>       <td>&euro;9,641.17 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>St. Patrick Day 2019</td>       <td>PHD Media &amp;amp; Adventure Publishing</td>       <td>&euro;13,376.50 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025   and Global Island Summit</td>       <td>PHD Media and BigO Media</td>       <td>&euro;14,457.25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Recruitment of Department of Foreign   Affairs &amp;amp; Trade Cultural Director</td>       <td>Mediavest </td>       <td>&euro;2,214.42 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Simon Cumbers Media Fund &amp;amp; &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;</td>       <td>Facebook &amp;amp; Twitter</td>       <td>&euro;663.25 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Table 2:<b>Public Information and Awareness Advertising Expenditure &ndash; 2016, 2017 and 2018 </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2018  </th>       <th>2017  </th>       <th>2016  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;243,687.00 </td>       <td>&euro;210, 324.15 </td>       <td>&euro;45,527.53 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The exact impact will be dependent on the nature of the final agreement between the EU and the UK regarding its involvement with the EU Budget post-Brexit. </p><p>Under the Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and UK, the UK had agreed to continue to pay into the EU Budget for the remaining years of the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), as if it was still a member. This would result in no additional impact on Ireland&rsquo;s contributions or receipts up to the end of the current Multiannual Financial Framework in December 2020.</p><p>The European Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 MFF (published May 2018) has been prepared on the basis of a UK departure. The overall 2021-2027 MFF proposal is 1.11 % of the post-Brexit EU-27's Gross National Income (GNI). This is the starting point of an important ongoing debate on the future of the EU Budget. There has been no final agreement on the size of the MFF yet however. </p><p>The contributions of each Member State to the EU Budget include Traditional Own Resources (Customs Duties) and a portion of VAT, with the remainder coming from GNI. </p><p>Ireland is forecast to see significant growth in our contributions as part of the next MFF as a result of continued economic growth, increased expenditure and the departure of the UK.</p><p>My Department monitors and analyses the potential impact of Brexit on our EU budget contributions on an ongoing basis.  The following table shows the projected  contributions Ireland would make in each of the years 2021-2027 under the Commission's proposal. This analysis is based on the best information and data available at the time in question. </p><p><b>Projected Irish Contributions to the MFF 2021-2027 under Commission Proposal (&euro;bn) (current prices)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>       <th>2026</th>       <th>2027</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total (round, &euro;25m)</td>       <td>&euro;2.900</td>       <td>&euro;2.950</td>       <td>&euro;3.125</td>       <td>&euro;3.275</td>       <td>&euro;3.500</td>       <td>&euro;3.675</td>       <td>&euro;3.850</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I briefly met Ms Georgieva shortly thereafter during my visit to Washington DC from 16-19 October to attend the Annual Meetings of World Bank/IMF.</p>  <p>  This short meeting did not have a formal agenda. I took the opportunity to congratulate Ms Georgieva on her appointment and wish her well in her new and challenging role.  I used the opportunity to brief her on developments in the Irish economy and the outlook for the period ahead.  Our discussions also touched on EU and international economic and financial developments. The new IMF MD spoke about the main priorities of her tenure . During the course of this meeting I also invited Ms Georgieva to visit Ireland and while no visit has yet been scheduled, my officials are liaising with the IMF to make the necessary arrangements.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, Christine Lagarde was appointed as President of the European Central Bank (ECB) on 18 October 2019, and she took up duty on 1 November 2019. As part of my ongoing international engagements, I will meet with President Lagarde in Frankfurt later this month. In any discussions with Madame Lagarde, or other officials of the ECB, I will, of course, be mindful and respectful of the ECB&rsquo;s independence.   </p>  <p>  The ECB's mandate is to maintain price stability in the euro area. The Central Bank of Ireland contributes to the formulation of monetary policy at Eurosystem level, and the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report provides further details of this contribution.</p>  <p>  The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union prohibits the ECB from seeking or taking instructions from EU institutions or bodies, from any government of an EU Member State, or from any other body. These requirements are set out in Article 130 of the Treaty and ensure that the principle of central bank independence is respected and there is no influence on the members of the ECB&rsquo;s decision-making bodies.</p></reply>

This framework has evolved significantly over the past two decades, particularly following the economic and fiscal crisis, which saw the SGP strengthened through the adoption of the so-called Six- and Two-pack legislative packages. </p>  <p>  The European Commission is obliged under the legislation to publish a review of the Six- and Two-packs every five years. The next review is due to be published by the end of 2019. These reviews evaluate, inter alia, the effectiveness of the regulations in ensuring closer co-ordination of economic policies and convergence of Member States&rsquo; economic performances, and, if appropriate, will be accompanied by proposals for amendments to the rules. </p>  <p>  To date, the Commission has not requested any formal submissions regarding improvements to the European fiscal rules ahead of the publication of the review. However, the European Fiscal Board has published an assessment of the EU&rsquo;s fiscal rules and this report was discussed at September&rsquo;s ECOFIN meeting.  </p>  <p>   I welcome the preliminary discussions on this topic at EU level, with which my officials and I will continue to actively engage.</p></reply>

The projects under these plans which include roads, schools, primary care centres, housing, sporting and cultural amenities and business activation facilities impact villages, towns, cities and regions across the length and breadth of Ireland. </p><p>Since taking responsibility for communications for Project Ireland 2040, &euro;92,954.26 has been spent by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on public information measures including the launch of the first Annual Report - see breakdown in Table A. Measures included three 2-week tranches of transit advertising on public transport networks throughout Ireland, with the specific aim of empowering members of the public to find out what is happening under Project Ireland 2040 in their local area. During each phase, the material was displayed on the Red and Green Luas lines as well as approximately 500 Dublin Buses, 50 Irish Rail carriages and 100 Bus Shelters in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and nationwide. The material directed the audience to gov.ie/2040.

Car Parking facilities are therefore available but, during busy periods, may be insufficient to meet demand. In line with OPW principles of sustainability, visitors are encouraged, where possible to walk, cycle or use public transport when travelling to the site. The Gardens are well served by Dublin Bus routes 4, 9, 83 and 155. Additional visitor parking is available at Glasnevin Cemetery and visitors can access the Gardens through the gate that connects the Gardens and the Cemetery. </p>  <p>  The National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin attracts over 600,000 visitors a year. During the recent half term period, the Gardens experienced unprecedented numbers of visitors (>8,000) on two particular days, creating traffic problems in the locale.  Even doubling the available car parking space, even if that were possible, would have had little or no impact on the thousands of cars attempting to reach the site on such occasions. </p>  <p>  The work of the Gardens, particularly in its fundamental role of conservation, research and education, is highly dependent on the vital propagation facilities and space of the nursery, which is, in effect, the powerhouse of the Gardens. When the first public carpark was constructed 19 years ago over a quarter of the original nursery area of the Gardens had to be sacrificed. Every area of the site is intensively used for the business of the Gardens and therefore it is not proposed to substantially increase car parking facilities on site.</p>  <p>   I can confirm nevertheless that the Office of Public Works is in consultations with Dublin City Council on the issue. A number of measures have been put in place to deal, in particular, with the issue of vehicles parking on footpaths which is the primary cause of traffic congestion in the vicinity. It is anticipated that with increased monitoring and enforcement of the 7-day cycle lane, traffic issues should be alleviated. </p>  <p>  In line with the sustainable living ethos of the Gardens, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, OPW encourages those for whom driving is not a necessity, to reduce the carbon intensity of their travel. The Garden&rsquo;s website and social media channels will continue to encourage users to consider walking or cycling to the Gardens and to provide details on bus numbers and routes as alternatives.</p></reply>

In addition, the Commissioners of Public Works, on behalf of the State, manage a diverse portfolio of heritage properties, visitor centres, Garda stations, former customs posts, former coastguard stations and sundry other properties located throughout the country.While the Commissioners of Public Works engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities where there may be surplus properties in our ownership that could be made available to them, the provision of social/affordable housing is not a function of the Commissioners. </p><p>In the past two years, the OPW has provided information on properties to the Department and, more recently, to the Land Development Agency, who assess those properties for suitability for residential use.  </p><p>This engagement process identified a number of OPW-owned properties as being feasible for adaption for residential use.  These include:</p><p><b>Properties transferred </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Property</th>       <th>Transferred To</th>       <th>Use</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 residential units in Dublin City Centre</td>       <td>Dublin City Council</td>       <td>Peter McVerry Trust</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Property at Clonard Road, Crumlin, Dublin</td>       <td>Dublin City Council (under Licence)</td>       <td>Family Hub</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 properties, Templemore, Tipperary</td>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>       <td>Social Housing</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Properties in process of transferring</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Property</th>       <th>Transferring to</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Former Garda residence, Buttevant</td>       <td>Cork County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Former Met Station, Kilkenny</td>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 acre site Thomastown Kilkenny</td>       <td>Kilkenny County Council</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The following expressions of interest have been made to the OPW to acquire sites that are surplus to our requirements, for residential development &ndash; </p><p><b>Expressions of interest in property</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Property</th>       <th>Expression of interest from</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 acre site Kill O The Grange</td>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6.45 acre site Thurles</td>       <td>Tipperary County Council</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 acre site Crosshaven Cork</td>       <td>Cork County Council</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The OPW actively manages its property portfolio on an ongoing basis.

On the establishment of the Land Development Agency a full examination of OPW properties was completed to identify any that might be suitable for residential development.  From that examination, the Land Development Agency only identified the Central Mental Hospital as a site suitable for residential development when the relocation of the Hospital by the HSE takes place.</p></reply>

Abatement is an important aspect of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 (the Single Scheme Act).   Section 52(1) to 52(5) provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new job shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old job.</p>  <p>  Abatement policy remains a key component of the Single Scheme Act and addresses valid concerns about simultaneous payment of both pension and salary in the public service. Consistency in the application of abatement principles across the public service is also important to ensure that the policy is implemented. While the high level operation of abatement is monitored on an ongoing basis, there no current plans to review the application of overall pension abatement policy to specific sectors of the public service.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. For school planning purposes Midleton is located in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area.</p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including three new primary schools and one new post-primary school in Cork. </p><p>While the 2018 announcement did not include a new school for the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>The following new schools were established in recent years in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area:</p><p>- Carrigtwohill Community College, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2016 to serve the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area; and</p><p>- Scoil Cliodhna Community National School, a new 16 classroom primary school established in 2015 to serve the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>The building project for Carrigtwohill Campus is being delivered under the Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme. This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Management team to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning, tendering and construction.  </p><p>An application for Planning Permission in respect of the works was submitted to the relevant Local Authority in July 2019.  A request for further information was received in August 2019.</p><p>The Department's Design and Build Project Management team are actively working on this Request for Further Information (RFI) and a response will be issued as soon as possible.</p><p>As with all school projects, the exact timeframe for delivery of the project will be dependent on the grant of planning permission.</p></reply>

My Department advised the schools to submit an application for consideration, for replacement/additional temporary accommodation required to address their current accommodation needs pending the delivery of the major school building project. </p>  <p>  At that meeting the consultant Design Team Quantity Surveyor advised that the company is withdrawing from the project. </p>  <p>  In early October 2019, the Design Team Consultant Architect advised that it is forced to withdraw from the project as the firm has gone into liquidation.

In addition, an applicant must have four years residence in the State during the 8 years immediately preceding that period (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years).  </p>  <p>  Applicants must therefore establish  that they have been resident in the State for these periods in order to be eligible for naturalisation. To this end, applicants should submit evidence with their application verifying that they satisfy the residency requirements for naturalisation. </p>  <p>  Applicants should also note that compliance with the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act does not automatically mean that an applicant will be granted a certificate of naturalisation as the grant of a certificate of naturalisation is, by law, discretionary. </p>  <p>  It is therefore very important for applicants to note that any absences from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application could result in a refusal to grant a certificate of naturalisation notwithstanding that they may have satisfied the statutory conditions for same set out in the 1956 Act. </p>  <p>  Where applicants are absent from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application the policy is to only grant a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that the travel was demonstrably unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. Applicants who find themselves in this position should submit as much information as possible with their application to verify that any travel outside of the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding their application was unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. </p>  <p>  Every application for naturalisation is considered having regard to circumstances of the individual applicant, the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act and the policy on the need for applicants to be physically present in the State for the full duration of the year immediately preceding the date of application. </p>  <p>  The applications for naturalisation in respect of the persons referred to by the Deputy were reviewed and the position remains as stated in the original decision. The applicants were informed of this by letters dated 24 October 2018.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions for naturalisation prescribed in the Act.  </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This compares favourably with the total of 3,130 or 21.7% of the total strength on 31 December 2008. </p><p>For the Deputy's information the following table, as supplied to me by the Commissioner, sets out the number of women in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the past five years, as requested by the Deputy. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2019 (at 31 October)</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2015</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number</td>       <td>3807</td>       <td>3759</td>       <td>3592</td>       <td>3392</td>       <td>3324</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Figures as at 31 October 2019</p><p>As this table shows, the number of women in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has steadily increased. This is particularly so in the last decade- the percentage of women in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has risen from 18.5% in 2006 to just under 27% today.  I understand that this is above the European average.  In the same period, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of female superintendents, inspectors and sergeants has doubled in the organisation. </p><p>The Deputy may be interested to know that in the course of its work, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) held semi-structured focus group discussions with female Garda members to explore the experiences of female Garda personnel regarding their careers, training and development and future prospects. Among the recommendations made in the CoFPI report, which the Government adopted in December 2018, is the reform of the current roster and greater flexibility of work practices which would enhance the attractiveness and job satisfaction of a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>In addition, the report also recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socioeconomic, educational and geographical backgrounds and that they would need to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake.</p><p>A concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that its membership reflects the community that it serves. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through online videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups. In the most recent recruitment campaign a series of videos and text were produced in multiple languages including English, Irish, French, Spanish, Italian and Arabic. They were published on the Garda Facebook page which has more than 180,000 followers.</p><p>While the current number of women members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is broadly in line with the percentage of women in police services across England and Wales, there is clearly scope for further improvement.  I expect that the above steps being taken by An Garda Siochana will ensure that the membership of the organisation can evolve to more closely reflect the society that it serves. </p></reply>

There is also a Constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Act also provides for the Court to have the power, in certain circumstances, to hear evidence from the victim of an alleged offence before a decision on bail is taken. </p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increases the use of curfews, and, where requested by Garda&iacute;, allows for the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that in accordance with the Europol Act 2012 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a permanent Garda representation in Europol Headquarters, The Hague. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on the Management Board of Europol and on the Heads of Europol National Units. </p>  <p>  The Irish Liaison Bureau in The Hague together with the Europol National Unit based in Garda Headquarters ensure continuous contact between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Europol on all areas of Europol mandated competence.  In particular, I am informed that Garda&iacute; from Special Crime Operations and the Special Detective Unit regularly interact with Europol and are involved in thematic and operational meetings.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that two Garda members are seconded to Interpol Headquarters in Lyon, France and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented on the Interpol European Committee. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages the Interpol network on a daily basis in the investigation of organised crime both nationally and internationally. </p>  <p>  Finally I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to participate in joint and multi-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional investigations, within the European Union and worldwide. Successful investigations, prosecutions and disruptions of criminal activities continue to be achieved in this way. </p></reply>

This information is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service website www.irishprisons.ie  (in the Information Centre, under Statistics &amp;amp; Information &ndash; Daily Prisoner Population).  The number of prisoners incarcerated and the bed capacity in each prison is included in that information. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the total number of prisoners in custody on 18 November 2019 was 4,009, compared to a bed capacity of 4,244.  This represents an occupancy level of 94%. Almost all of the closed institutions are operating at or near full capacity. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. The prisoner population varies over time depending on a range of factors. </p>  <p>  An audit of existing accommodation is underway, in order to identify where additional spaces can be brought on stream.  The construction of the female prison in Limerick as well as a new wing for Limerick male prison are underway. Together they will provide 158 new spaces.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that plans are advanced for the re-opening of accommodation not currently being used within the prison system. This includes the re-opening of the Training Unit which will provide over 90 additional spaces. </p>  <p>  Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, I am informed that the Prison Service makes very effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers and Temporary Release.  Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case-by-case basis.  The safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to know for example that Community Return is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences from one to eight years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work.  Since its inception, 2,279 prisoners have been released to take part in this scheme.  There were also 2,460 prisoners serving sentences between 3 and 12 months released to take part in the Community Support Scheme.</p></reply>

I am assured however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>Appointments to the ranks of Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner are made by Government on the nomination of the Authority.</p><p>Since 1 January 2017, the process of selecting and appointing members to the ranks of Assistant Commissioner, Chief Superintendent and Superintendent lies with the Policing Authority.  As Minister, I have no role in the selection and appointment of candidates to these ranks with the exception of members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), whose appointment by the Authority must be approved by the Government. I understand that the Authority held competitions for each of these ranks in 2017 and for Superintendent and Chief Superintendent ranks in 2018. A panel of candidates for both ranks was established by the Authority. The existence of panels ensures that as vacancies arise they can be filled without any undue delay.  </p><p>Appointments to the ranks of sergeant and inspector are a matter for the Commissioner under section 14 of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005  <b>.</b></p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner that competitions for promotion to the rank of sergeant and inspector were held last year in order to bring the number in these ranks up to the full strength as agreed under the Employment Control Framework (ECF). The allocation of successful candidates is currently underway, with 423 newly promoted Sergeants and 190 new promoted Inspectors having been appointed to date.</p><p>The Policing Authority is responsible for approving the number and grades of Garda Staff (with the consent of the Ministers for Justice and Public Expenditure and Reform) and since taking over this function has given approval for 378 positions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Of these 378 positions, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a total of 56 positions are currently vacant and that recruitment is in train. In some cases, the Authority, in approving posts, advises on the way in which they are to be filled, particularly in the case of professional, technical and specialist posts.</p><p>In common with Government Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also conducts internal promotional competitions as appropriate, which affords staff the opportunity to progress in their careers within the organisation if they so wish.  </p><p>All positions at Executive Officer grade and above are potential promotional opportunities for Garda Staff.I am informed by the Garda Authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is recruiting through the Public Appointments Service for posts from Principal Officer level to Executive Officer level.  There is also a live internal Assistant Principal Officer competition underway and I understand that it is planned to hold an internal competition at Higher Executive Officer level early next year.  Panels created as a result of these competitions will be used to fill posts as approved by the Policing Authority and in accordance with centrally agreed sequences.</p><p>In addition, Garda Staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are civil servants of the state and as such are entitled, if otherwise qualified, to participate in interdepartmental competitions for promotion or open competitions for any post within the Civil Service conducted by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the following table the vacancies at each rank as compared to the ECF as of 18 November 2019, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Garda Commissioner.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Vacancies at each rank as compared to the ECF as of 18 November 2019 </th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commissioner</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D/Commissioner</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>A/Commissioner</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chief Superintendent</td>       <td>47</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Superintendent</td>       <td>168</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inspector</td>       <td>381</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sergeant</td>       <td>2,110</td>       <td>132</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Some of these difficulties had arisen because third party agents had been able to secure multiple appointments through the use of automatic software. </p>  <p>  A set of software fixes was introduced in mid-September 2018 to prevent this abuse of the system.  As far as can be determined, this software update has been successful in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents.  The system is being regularly monitored in this regard. </p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some third party agents continue to book individual appointments with information supplied to them by customers. My Department strongly advises our customers not to provide sensitive personal data to these unregulated agents.    </p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be tendering for a replacement online appointments system, which is being designed to prevent the block-booking of appointments. This new system will also assist in streamlining and improving the current online booking process. As part of the Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 for Immigration Service Delivery, a number of other options are also being considered with a view to improving customer service and efficiency as well as meeting the growing demand for registration in Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.477.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000077#WRJ01600"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a number of studies have been conducted on the economic and trade impacts of Brexit that point to the significant challenges that Brexit presents for employment in key sectors of the economy, and in certain regions of the country that are most exposed to Brexit. </p>  <p>  Government has been upfront all along signalling that Brexit is damaging for the economy, gives rise to very few opportunities and is an exercise in damage limitation. Nonetheless, we are working across Government to create the best environment for businesses to grow, to innovate, to be competitive and ultimately, to create jobs.</p>  <p>  In previous replies to the Deputy on this issue, I have set out the broad range of Brexit supports and measures put in place by Government as well as through the State Agencies under my remit, principally Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. These initiatives are all aimed at helping businesses to compete, to diversify into new markets, to grow exports and to sustain valuable employment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Budget 2020 was framed from the perspective of a No Deal Brexit. In such a scenario, my Department will have immediate access to an emergency support package of &euro;110 million. Funding will be available on day one of a crash-out to activate four specific schemes and other measures supporting those businesses most affected. The schemes will be available to vulnerable but viable firms with verifiable Brexit-exposure to help them adjust to the new trading reality and to develop new products and processes for export to new markets. </p>  <p>  On a positive note, our economy has performed strongly in recent years with record numbers in employment as evidenced from the latest CSO figures that puts the unemployment rate at 4.8%. However, this strong economic performance cannot be taken for granted and must evolve to meet future challenges. </p>  <p>  That is why, in March this year, I launched the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. This is an ambitious, medium-term framework to create a sustainable, resilient and future-oriented economy in Ireland over the years to 2025.  Future Jobs Ireland aims to ensure that as our economy changes, and traditional industries and practices are disrupted, workers and enterprises are able to transition successfully. If we adapt now, our enterprises can stay competitive and our society resilient.</p>  <p>  On 7 November my Department hosted a Future Jobs Ireland Summit with two hundred attendees from enterprises, representative bodies, academia, public sector and civil society. The aim of the Summit was for attendees to exchange ideas and input to the development of Future Jobs Ireland 2020. Along with the Department of the Taoiseach, my Department is working with other Government Departments and stakeholders to develop new commitments for Future Jobs Ireland 2020 which is expected to launch in early 2020.</p>  <p>  Regional development is also a key priority for Government. The Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 aim to continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. The Plans, which are shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, are crucial in meeting the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region, by 2020. </p>  <p>  A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the national average. We want to ensure that we are creating quality jobs that are sustainable in the longer term, so that we can secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic success, in line with the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. </p></reply>

Technological innovation is radically transforming our lives and will continue to do so. Automation, AI and other forms of technological innovation are expected to radically change many jobs, enterprises, and entire industries. The move to a low-carbon economy will also radically change important sectors of the economy and present new opportunities to those firms on the cutting edge of this transition.</p><p>Technological change is already impacting several sectors, such as manufacturing, finance, retail and transport. This presents challenges but also new possibilities - certain job roles will disappear or be redefined, and brand-new job roles will appear requiring new and different skillsets. We want Ireland to be at the frontier of technological developments by rapidly adopting new technologies to boost productivity and ensure that Ireland continues to be competitive internationally. To do this, we must enable and encourage innovation across sectors and firms. Increasing investment in research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) and promoting strong links between enterprise and the research community will assist in ensuring Ireland keeps its relative advantage in the tech world and increase the pace of development of the green economy. </p><p>On 10 March 2019, the Government launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019, the first in a series of annual reports as part of a multi-annual framework to ensure our enterprises and workers are resilient and prepared for future challenges and opportunities. This is a whole of Government approach and forms a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term. </p><p>Future Jobs Ireland focuses on five key Pillars, namely: </p><p>1. Embracing Innovation and Technological Change; </p><p>2. Improving SME Productivity; </p><p>3. Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent; </p><p>4. Increasing Participation in the Labour Force; and </p><p>5. Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy. </p><p>Each Pillar sets high level targets for 2025. For Pillar 1: Embracing Innovation and Technological Change, Future Jobs Ireland is targeting an increase in Gross Expenditure on Research &amp;amp; Development intensity from 1.4% to 2.5% of GNP by 2025. It is also aiming for substantial increases in the share of SMEs introducing product or process innovations and with marketing or organisational innovations.</p><p>Overall, Future Jobs Ireland 2019 includes 26 meaningful and impactful ambitions supported by 127 deliverables for completion in 2019. Future Jobs Ireland is delivering on a range of Ambitions in Pillar 1: Embracing Innovation and Technological Change. These are:</p><p>1. Position Ireland as a leading pioneer in technology adoption by investing in demonstrator sites and developing enabling frameworks and standards </p><p>2. Implement a strategic approach to maximise the benefits from digitalisation</p><p>3. Position the Public Service to be a leader in technology adoption and innovation</p><p>4. Establish Top Teams to realise opportunities presented by technological changes and the move to a low carbon economy</p><p>5. Increase the capacity of SMEs to engage in research, development &amp;amp; innovation</p><p>6. Incentivise SMEs to invest in new technologies</p><p>7. Develop Transition Teams to assist workers and sectors likely to be most challenged by our changing economy </p><p>Through Future Jobs Ireland we have issued a further call under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund and are developing further incentives to innovate; we are working to develop Ireland as a centre for developing and testing new technologies; we are delivering policy initiatives including an Industry 4.0 Strategy, a National Digital Strategy, and a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy; we are establishing Top Teams in Artificial Intelligence, GovTech and offshore renewables; we are further developing eHealth opportunities; and we are embracing the digital transformation of public services. </p><p>I also recognise the importance of innovation in securing a resilient enterprise base. This was reflected in Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy for research and development, science and technology. My officials have now commenced work on a successor strategy to Innovation 2020 which will reflect our priorities in relation to research and innovation.  I envisage this being ready for implementation from 2021 on.</p><p>My Department and the Department of the Taoiseach are currently working with the other Government Departments and other stakeholders to develop new commitments for inclusion in Future Jobs Ireland 2020 which is expected to launch in early 2020. </p></reply>

Staff are encouraged to use keep cups and reusable biodegradable bottles supplied by the Department. </p><p>Over the summer 2019, the &ldquo;Green Team&rdquo;, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, undertook some adjustment works on the water flow system underpinning the toilet facilities in the Kildare Street building. Thus far, this has yielded a significant daily saving on water usage by reducing the unaccounted for water by over 50%. We are exploring such adjustments in our other buildings. </p><p>In many offices we have also consolidated the use of single waste bins per staff member and moved to centralised bins per floor including enhanced recycling bins and food waste bins. This has significantly reduced the level of general waste along with plastic bags being used for waste collection.</p><p>More specific details on the Department&rsquo;s internal green initiatives for 2019 can be found in our Resource Efficiency Action Plan 2019 published on my Department&rsquo;s website at </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is expected to support 23,042 people at any one time in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 saw an increase of &euro;24.3m over 2018 making a total budget of &euro;985.8m for 2019. In 2020, the NHSS will see a further investment in its budget of &euro;45 million, bringing the total annual budget for NHSS to &euro;1.03bn. This substantial investment will provide ongoing long-term residential care over the course of 2020 ensuring that the Scheme continues to deliver affordable and accessible nursing home care for our citizens with long-term care needs.</p><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to Nursing Homes Support Scheme residents. The NTPF established processes are the appropriate mechanism for engagement. The established processes include provision for an NTPF review mechanism where agreement is not initially reached in relation to the price.</p><p>The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with a nursing home on an individual basis. The Minister for Health does not have any role in this regard. I understand that the negotiation process is very active at present, with a meeting between the organisations held last week. I strongly encourage continuation of this engagement through the established mechanisms. </p><p>In relation to the day care service, the HSE has been in extensive engagement with the St John of God Hospitaller Services Group at St Joseph's and this engagement is also ongoing. The HSE met with representatives from St. Joseph's last week on this matter and I understand that this was a positive engagement that will continue over the next short while and I hope it will conclude in a resolution between the parties. </p></reply>

HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. </p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.</p>  <p>  HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.  Section 9 of the Act sets out the grounds under which HIQA may undertake an investigation into a particular service, or may be requested to undertake such an investigation by the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  Following a statutory consultation process and  Ministerial approval, HIQA published specific national standards for community health and social care services in Ireland (including nursing and residential homes), which cover infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship. The standards outline 20 standard statements and cover important areas such as communicating well with people who use community health or social care services, involving people in making decisions about their care, providing care in a clean and safe environment and prescribing antimicrobial medication in a safe manner. </p>  <p>  Standard 3.4 of this document sets out measures to ensure that outbreaks of infection (including influenza infection) are identified, managed, controlled and documented in a timely and effective manner that such premises are required to implement. These measures are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Staff report to their line manager any signs or symptoms of infection in individuals or groups of people or residents to facilitate prevention, early detection and control the spread of infection.</p>  <p>  - Staff know who to contact for advice in the event of a suspected or confirmed outbreak and are encouraged to ask for advice from colleagues, such as a community infection prevention and control nurse, the local Department of Public Health and or a consultant microbiologist, if uncertain about the  best course of action.</p>  <p>  - Any suspected or confirmed outbreaks of infection are promptly notified to the medical officer of health in the relevant Department of Public Health, in line with legislation. Registered providers of designated centres are also required to report outbreaks of notifiable diseases to HIQA.</p>  <p>  - All facilities where care is delivered have a documented outbreak management plan appropriate to the services provided, detailing the action to be taken in the event of an outbreak of infection, in line with relevant national guidelines where they exist.</p>  <p>  - Staff clearly communicate with and support people affected by an outbreak in a timely and effective manner.</p>  <p>  -  All staff implement outbreak control measures as soon as possible to help reduce the impact of the outbreak. Consideration is given to the impact of visiting restrictions on residents and their families.</p>  <p>  - A nominated person from the residential care service liaises with specialist staff, such as the community infection prevention and control nurse and the local Department of Public Health, and provides all information necessary to assess and control the outbreak. </p></reply>

This year, for the first time, on foot of a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee a quadrivalent influenza vaccine will be used instead of the standard trivalent vaccine. The provision of a quadrivalent vaccine will offer a substantially greater level of protection to the population when compared to the trivalent vaccine provided in recent years.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the HSE that they have not written specifically to private hospitals.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p><p>As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p><p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p><p>My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines.  These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p><p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p><p>The HSE received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) in Multiple Sclerosis.</p><p>  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.</p><p>  Application 2 is for the use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.</p><p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p><p>The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy. </p><p>The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 25 September 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.</p></reply>

Hospitals are working towards a HSE targeted minimum prescribing rate for biosimilars of 50%.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also working on identifying barriers to the prescribing of biosimilars, with a specific focus on education and support. It is seeking to increase understanding of biosimilars through targeted presentations to clinicians and hospitals.  This is proving promising, for example the prescribing rate for the biosimilar drug Infliximab increased from 5% in 2017 to 40% in 2018.</p>  <p>  In May 2019, the HSE Medicines Management Programme completed the evaluation process for the identification of the best-value biological (BVB) medicines for TNF-α inhibitors on the High-Tech Drug arrangements. In June 2019 the HSE introduced a system of gain-share to encourage the prescribing of the BVB medicines.</p>  <p>  Drawing together all of these  initiatives  my Department, in collaboration with a number of agencies, is currently developing a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy Statement. The aim of the statement and supporting documentation is to highlight and endorse the many initiatives that are already underway in Ireland and thereby to promote confidence in biosimilar use among healthcare professionals.</p></reply>

The Bill will include provisions to prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products, including e-cigarettes, to and by persons under 18 years and will introduce a licensing system for the retail sale of nicotine inhaling products. </p>  <p>  E-cigarettes are already regulated by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 271 of 2016) which transpose EU Directive 2014/40/EU on Tobacco and Related Products. </p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. In addition, the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturer, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations there must be health warnings on packaging which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance. Finally the Regulations prohibit advertisements for e-cigarettes on television and radio, online, and in printed publications, other than publications directed at persons in the e-cigarette industry or publications outside the EU. </p>  <p>  The current position on e-cigarettes is based on advice from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in its 2017 Health Technology Assessment of Smoking Cessation Products and Services. In relation to the safety of e-cigarettes the HIQA assessment concluded that this remains an evolving area of research and that while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on long-term safety has yet to be established. </p>  <p>  Although the HIQA assessment was published only in 2017, in March of this year I asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence on the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. This review is expected to be completed in March 2020 and its findings will contribute to informing any additional regulation in this area.</p></reply>

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in many cases, the existence of an inspection will not necessarily be delaying payment. In relation to the ANC Scheme, this scheme is subject to a range of eligibility and compliance criteria such as the requirement to meet a minimum stocking density in addition to maintaining minimum livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  At this stage, a number of farmers are not eligible to receive payment as they have not met scheme-specific criteria. When an applicant meets these criteria, they will become eligible for payment, which will be processed promptly. Factors that may impact on payment issuing under BPS include, for example, applications to transfer entitlements, request for change in ownership etc., and officials in my Department are actively processing such cases. </p>  <p>  Some 8,000 applicants have been selected for a Land Eligibility inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 19th November, inspections results have been received for over 90% of these inspections, of which 92% have been advanced to payment stage processing. The balance of these cases fall into a number of categories, namely, applicants have been notified of the inspection outcome where an area over-declaration has been identified and a response is awaited; applicants have chosen to submit comments on notified inspection outcomes - these are currently being examined and are subject to final processing. The balance of the outstanding inspection results are currently being finalised and will then be advanced through the final stages of processing promptly.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to finalise the outcome of both Ground and Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that BPS and ANC Schemes payments due are issued as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Previously, my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density. </p><p>From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope</p><p>In tandem with the process to designate relevant lands under these biophysical criteria, Member States were also required to undertake a fine tuning process. This process was required to identify areas where significant natural constraints were identified with reference to the above-listed biophysical criteria, but where objective criteria, such as arable land use or stocking density levels, would indicated that these constraints have been overcome.</p><p>Finally, Member States could also identify areas for inclusion as Areas of Specific Constraint where it is necessary for land management to be continued in order to conserve or improve the environment, to maintain the countryside, to preserve the tourist potential of the area, or to protect the coastline.</p><p>This three-phased process was a lengthy project, involving protracted technical engagements with the EU DG for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre in the EU Commission. The technical process was completed in late 2018 and, at that time, further to a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders, I published full details in relation to the outcome of the review project, which can be summarised as follows. The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme remains eligible under the new approach. Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible under the new designation. Farmers impacted financially by this change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and 2020. Over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019. </p><p>An independently chaired Appeals Committee was appointed to examine any requests received by my Department for a full review on the status of a townland under the 2019 ANC Scheme. This process is currently under way and it is anticipated that the process will be completed in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The Organic Sector Strategy Group included representatives from a broad range of stakeholders, among them the Farming Representative Organisations, processors and Organic Control Bodies. Following assessment by the Group and based on market demand and supply deficits in organic horticulture, cereals and dairy, the Group recommended the re-opening of the OFS targeting expenditure towards the areas in deficit. Selection criteria with revised marking which would facilitate such a targeted reopening were agreed by the Group.  </p><p>Under the Organic Farming Scheme ranking and selection criteria, marks were awarded under the following criteria:</p><p>- Existing OFS participants and licensed organic operators whose contracts expired in 2013/2014/2015 (Maximum 5 marks);</p><p>- Sectoral Balance Enterprise (based on Animal Health Computer System/Basic Payment System database or as per application form - Maximum 50 marks);</p><p>- Total Conversion vs Partial Conversion as per Basic Payment System application (Maximum 10 marks);</p><p>- Large operators  i.e. 1 mark for owned land and 0.5 marks for leased land ( Maximum 50 marks);</p><p>- Mixed Farms ( Maximum 10 marks).</p><p>225 applications were received by the closing date. A total of 58 applications were either withdrawn or were deemed ineligible. Following the ranking and selection process, one applicant withdrew, 55 were successful and 111 applicants received letters informing them that they had been unsuccessful. </p><p>The Deputy should be aware that the predominant farming enterprises in 95% of the unsuccessful applications were not from the targeted sectors.</p></reply>

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that in many cases, the existence of an inspection will not necessarily be delaying payment. In relation to the ANC Scheme, this scheme is subject to a range of eligibility and compliance criteria such as the requirement to meet a minimum stocking density, in addition to maintaining minimum livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  At this stage, a number of farmers are not eligible to receive payment as they have not met scheme-specific criteria. When an applicant meets these criteria they will become eligible for payment, which will be processed promptly. Factors that may impact on payment issuing under BPS include, for example, applications to transfer entitlements, change in ownership request etc., and officials in my Department are actively processing such cases. </p>  <p>  Some 6,800 applicants have been selected for a Remote Sensing inspection in respect of the various 2019 area-based schemes. As of 19th November, inspections results have been received for some 90% of these inspections, of which 97% have been advanced to payment stage processing. The balance of these cases fall into a number of categories, namely, applicants have been notified of the inspection outcome where an area over-declaration has been identified and a response is awaited; applicants have chosen to submit comments on notified inspection outcomes and these are currently being examined and cases are subject to final processing. The balance of the inspection results are currently being finalised and will be advanced through the final stages of processing promptly.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to finalise the outcome of Remote Sensing inspections on a daily basis to ensure that BPS and ANC Schemes payments due are issued as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

The Commissioner will help ensure a co-ordinated and effective approach to a Just Transition for communities and workers affected by the imminent ending of peat harvesting for power generation in the Midlands region.  The Terms of Reference for the Just Transition Commissioner set out that the secretariat support for the Commissioner will be provided by my Department or the Midlands Transition Team as appropriate.  Further details such as the remuneration of the Commissioner and the term of the contract are currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  Together with my ministerial colleagues the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe T.D., the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Josepha Madigan T.D and the Minister of State for the Office of Public Works Kevin Moran T.D., I recently met with workers affected by the recent announcements from both Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB as well as Union representatives and Oireachtas members. </p>  <p>  The Government has also prioritised a number of initiatives for the Midlands in the context of Budget 2020 including:-</p>  <p>  - &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund, targeted at the Midlands, to support the retraining and reskilling of workers and to assist local communities and businesses in the Region to adjust to the low carbon transition. In recognition of their longstanding relationship with communities in the Midlands, the ESB has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund bringing its total value to &euro;11m. While details around the allocation of this fund are still being finalised, it is expected that it will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further consultation with the structures in place in the Midlands, including the Midlands Transition Team, on the application of the funding. </p>  <p>  - &euro;5 million for a National Parks and Wildlife Service bog restoration and rehabilitation programme to restore 1,800 hectares of bog to their natural habitat, ensuring the return of these bogs to carbons sinks once again and creating 70 to 100 jobs. </p>  <p>  - &euro;20 million targeted at the Midlands, to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades, as set out in the Climate Action Plan, which will support an estimated 400 direct and indirect jobs, as well as significantly upgrading the social housing stock in the region.</p></reply>

Businesses can already avail of accelerated capital allowances for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure on their premises. This enables businesses to invest in energy efficient equipment, including electric charging infrastructure, and deduct the full cost of such equipment from their profits in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years. </p>  <p>  This support is part of a range of supports available for the development of charging infrastructure which include a home charger grant of up to &euro;600 to support the purchase and installation of a home charger for purchasers of electric vehicles and grants available to local authorities for the development of on-street public charge points. Funding of &euro;6 million will be available in 2020 for these schemes. </p>  <p>  In addition, under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million which will support the ESB to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with the ESB also investing &euro;10 million. </p></reply>

Both of the ESB-owned Midlands electricity generation stations, West Offaly Power and Lough Ree Power, and the Bord na M&oacute;na-owned plant at Edenderry were allocated support for fuelling the plants with up to 30% biomass. Bord na M&oacute;na currently co-fires its plant with 30% biomass. Due to the failure to obtain planning permission for West Offaly to co-fire with biomass beyond the end of 2020, and the decision by ESB to withdraw its application for planning for Lough Ree, the allocations under the support scheme for these plants are unlikely to be taken up.    It is now proposed to put in place a new PSO for the enhanced rehabilitation of the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs over and above what Bord na M&oacute;na is obliged to do under its EPA licences. The support will be ring-fenced and used specifically for bog rehabilitation. It is expected that the proposed enhanced restoration and rehabilitation scheme will have benefits accruing from biodiversity provision, water quality, and increased carbon storage and sequestration. </p>  <p>  The proposed scheme is not a tax on carbon. It is a scheme to support biodiversity and to ensure the bogs revert to their natural state as the most efficient carbon stores. </p></reply>

Approximately &euro;100 million has been allocated to these schemes in 2019. An overview of what is available is set out below.    The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grants covering up to 30% of the cost of home energy upgrades. The measures covered by this scheme, such as cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, solar thermal, heating controls and a BER certificate, were expanded over the last year to include deeper measures such as external wall insulation and heat pumps. &euro;22 million was allocated in 2019 with 14,361 homes receiving funding for upgrades to end of October.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The measures were expanded in 2018 to include internal and external insulation. In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the scheme with 2,891 homes upgraded by end of October.</p>  <p>  The Better Energy Communities Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. It also encourages innovative measures and solutions. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers. The scheme leverages considerable additional private investment. In 2019, &euro;23 million was allocated to the scheme, with 57 projects granted approval including 685 homes.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan has committed to increasing the scale and depth of retrofit activity in order to meet our emissions reduction targets from the Built Environment. This will involve 500,000 homes being upgraded to a BER B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent by 2030. A Retrofit Taskforce, chaired by my Department, is driving the achievement of this target. A key part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work will be designing a national retrofit delivery model that groups homes together to achieve economies of scale and provides smart financing options and easy pay back methods. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has allocated &euro;146 million for retrofitting homes and businesses which will support the upgrade of 24,000 properties in 2020. </p></reply>

The AMBER areas represent the areas to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led Intervention, the contract for which was signed on 19 November with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP will rollout high speed broadband to people living and working in nearly 540,000 premises which include almost 100,000 businesses and farms and 695 schools where commercial operators will not deliver this service.</p>  <p>  Approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) will be deployed across all counties during 2020. The BCPs will be located in community centres, schools, library hubs and local GAA halls and will enable communities to get free public access to high speed broadband. The BCP locations are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  NBI will pass approximately 10,000 premises by the end of 2020. By the end of 2021, NBI plans to pass approximately 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. NBI has indicated that the network rollout will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment. A deployment plan will be made available by NBI shortly. Over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that an email from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 6 September 2019 and a reply was issued on 24 September 2019.</p>  <p>  With regard to the eir fibre rollout close to the premises referred to by the Deputy, eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and not part of the planned State Intervention network. It is not funded by the State and is not planned, designed or directed by the Department in any capacity. The decision as to what areas and premises are served is a matter for eir.</p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with industry on an ongoing basis over the past four years, my Department recently conducted a final public consultation to close the mapping exercise in advance of the award of the NBP contract. Having evaluated the submissions received, approximately 38,000 premises were removed from the intervention area as commercial operators provided evidence that these premises can now access a high speed broadband service from an existing network. </p>  <p>  The commitment agreement entered into in 2017 in respect of the eir 300k fibre network, related to premises that were removed from the intervention area on the basis of a future concrete plan by a commercial operator for a network that was yet to be built.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.758.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000082#WRO00800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.</p>  <p>  Council Directive (EU) 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners&rsquo; agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention aims to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working in the fishing sector on vessels registered in an EU Member State.  As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party.  My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive.</p>  <p>  On 9th October, my Department issued Marine Notice 42 of 2019, to provide key stakeholders with a brief overview of some of the main changes that will come into effect once the draft legislation has been finalised.  Summarising the provisions of Article 6 of the Annex to Council Directive (EU) 2017/159, Marine Notice 42 of 2019 states that, &ldquo;fishers who are 16 or 17 years of age may perform duties provided that they are no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling, they have completed a basic pre-sea training course, their mental and physical well-being is fully protected and they have received adequate instruction&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The requirement to complete a basic pre-sea training course is a long established practice. Under the provisions of S.I. No. 587/2001 Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations, 2001, a new entrant, defined as &ldquo;a person who is for the first time gainfully employed or engaged as a crew member&rdquo; must complete a safety training course before proceeding to sea. Bord Iascaigh Mhara provides Basic Safety Training for new entrants. In keeping with the requirements of S.I. No. 587/2001, the training consists of three elements: Personal Survival Techniques (STCW-95 Certificate), Elementary First Aid (STCW-95 Certificate) and Fire Prevention and Safety Awareness.</p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the safety of workers, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and its subsidiary regulations cover all workers, irrespective of age or work activity. There is a statutory responsibility for a risk assessment to be carried and maintained and that safety controls are set out in the employer&rsquo;s legally required safety statement. Where the employer&rsquo;s risk assessment finds that only light work on fishing vessels can be done safely by anyone over 15 and under 18, then it is the employer's legal responsibility to ensure that such a limitation on the work and workers is imposed. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that Part 6, Chapter 1 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 299 of 2007), relating to the protection of children and young persons, includes provisions around the employer carrying out risk assessments to determine any specific risks to the safety, health and welfare of children (under 16) and young persons (under 18) arising from how work is carried out. Any such risk assessment should be sufficiently robust to determine if the work involved is beyond the physical or psychological capacity of the child or young person, and take account of the use of harmful substances, extremes of heat, cold, noise or vibration in the work which a child/young person may not recognize as risks. It should be noted that this legislation falls under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-20a.767.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112000082#WRO01800"><p>In February 2011, Dublin City Council (DCC) took over responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers from the Garda Carriage Office.  This was achieved through bye-laws enacted under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001; that legislation provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  It is under this Act that local authorities can choose, using bye-laws, to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward within their functional area.  These bye-laws allow relevant local authorities to set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.</p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this legal basis for making such bye-laws could be uncertain.  Local authorities may not make bye-laws for purposes provided for elsewhere in legislation.  And the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had previously vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. </p>  <p>  My Department examined this issue and, following legal advice, is now of the view that the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.  </p>  <p>  I understand that DCC first became aware of the present legal issues during a routine review of the bye-laws that considered, inter alia, whether there was need to strengthen measures to safeguard the welfare of horses used to draw carriages. Furthermore, the Control of Horses Act 1996 allows local authorities to introduce bye-laws designating certain areas as control areas for horses. Dublin City Council has designated its administrative boundaries as such a control area under its Control of Horses Bye-Laws 2014. These bye-laws require horses to be licensed and set minimum standards for the keeping of horses within the control area. </p>  <p>  Regulations for horse-drawn carriages for hire or reward should be aligned with any horse welfare obligations imposed by local authorities. Accordingly, I have formed the view that horse-drawn carriages for hire and reward should be regulated by local authorities.</p>  <p>  This is a complex issue which spans the responsibilities of several Departments and levels of government. Accordingly, my Department is working with colleagues across Government, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to identify how best to empower Dublin City Council to regulate this matter in Dublin, just as other local authorities regulate this matter elsewhere in the country.  This work is progressing and I expect to be in a position to bring legislative proposals to Government for approval before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Handsets were refreshed during 2018 and a suitable device was chosen at an initial cost of &euro;129 per device.  22 staff availed of an option to upgrade the proposed supplied device, and paying the difference between the cost price and &euro;129.The figures listed in the table for handsets also include replacement and repairs during those years.  Officials in my Department monitor the cost of usage of mobile phones on a monthly basis and staff are requested to indicate non-work related charges and to reimburse those to the Department.</p><p>When roaming for business purposes outside of the EU, staff are placed on specific 'add on' mobile tariff rates for the duration of their trip to help reduce costs.  Staff are encouraged to utilise secure WiFi in non-EU destinations when data is required.  Staff also use Departmentally supplied mobile data hotspots for data access during their trip - the cost of usage of these devices is significantly lower than roaming data charges. </p><p>Details of the amount spent on purchasing mobile phones for staff within my Department for work-related business in the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019 are provided in the table.  The figures by grade include some charges for handsets but also include charges for calls, data usage and roaming.

It can be found at .</p><p>I would particularly draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that there has been a slight decline in speeding on urban roads and a similar increase on rural roads.  There have also been increases in the proportion of drivers speeding on roads with an 80km/h and 100km/h limit.  </p><p>Speeding represents the single most dangerous factor on our roads.  It makes collisions more likely, and it makes death or serious injury more likely when collisions happen.  To take just one figure, the fact that 50% of people are speeding on 80km/h roads is utterly unacceptable.  They are putting themselves, their passengers, and other road users at risk.</p><p>Dealing with speeding is a matter of education, appropriate penalties, and proper enforcement.  In this context I am proposing to introduce a graduated speeding system as part of the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  This will be aimed at targeting the most dangerous speeding offences, providing a deterrent against speeding, and emphasising the message that speeding cannot be tolerated on our roads.</p></reply>

The short and long term effects of homelessness on children are well documented. While Tusla does not have a direct role in the provision of housing or accommodation for homeless families a range of services, from prevention and early intervention through to child welfare and protection, are provided.</p>  <p>  Tusla works in partnership with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) and is a key partner on several interagency groups. Bilateral meetings between the DRHE and Tusla take place monthly. Tusla supports &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres being led by the DRHE. Tusla staff participate as required on issues involving child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) services. The Tusla Homelessness Liaison Officer plays a key role in coordinating this multi-agency response.</p>  <p>  While homelessness is not a reason for a referral to child protection services, there may be child protection or welfare concerns for some children. Tusla undertakes visits to Family Hubs and emergency accommodation providers to ensure that they are aware of their requirements under Children First and to clarify referral queries. Tusla has progressed plans for the linkage of Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs) with family hubs and other homeless accommodation.</p>  <p>  Tusla also works in partnership with a number of Family Resource Centres (FRCs) to provide dedicated services for families experiencing homelessness. Tusla has also supported the evening service at the Focus Ireland Coffee Shop, a service which includes a range of supports to homeless families, high quality food, and rooms for children to do homework supported by an educational tutor. Tusla also funds the work of two child support workers in Focus Ireland.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that the needs of homeless families require a response from across Government and beyond. I have asked that Tusla provide further detail in regard to family support workers directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

This provides for an unprecedented investment in public water and wastewater infrastructure over the next ten years.  This significant multi-billion euro investment programme will ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of Ireland&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and continued care of the water environment.</p></reply>

Working with the broader Housing and Planning Divisions in my Department, other key agencies, local authorities and the construction sector, the HDO supports the roll-out of complex projects, including identifying and resolving barriers to delivery, and monitors development across key sites as they progress. </p>  <p>  At the time of its establishment, the HDO comprised a team of 4 people with extensive expertise in project management, finance, planning and local government, including staff seconded from the local government sector and the National Development Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Having carried out a range of initial initiatives, and taking account of the fact that some assignments to the office were time-limited, the HDO was refocused in September 2017 to work more closely on supporting local housing delivery and land management. In that context, the current team is comprised of 2 civil servants with experience of housing delivery and the local government sector.  In addition to this complement of staff, the HDO draws on supports from other relevant Business Units in my Department, the local authorities and other relevant public bodies.  </p>  <p>  More recently, my Department has been engaging with the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) in respect of the sector's further delivery needs and, against this background, I met with Chief Executives in September 2019 to discuss plans for a newly reconfigured HDO. I expect to receive final proposals from the LGMA in this regard shortly.</p></reply>

authority housing stock, including the implementation of planned maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, is a matter for each individual local authority.</p><p>Local authority housing stock becomes vacant and is refurbished and re-let on a continuous basis by the local authorities and my Department does not have information on all such re-lets and their cost.  My Department does provide some exchequer funding to support local authorities in tackling vacant social housing through the voids programme, particularly homes that would likely remain vacant for a significant period of time because of the scale of the works required.  The programme assists local authorities in actively targeting such vacant properties, to minimise their turnaround and re-let times and return them to use in an energy efficient condition.  </p><p>The following table shows the number of units supported and funding provided by my

This work includes the development of two pathfinder projects on local authority-owned sites, from which lessons will be drawn to inform an optimum model for Cost Rental delivery at the national level.</p>  <p>  The first of these projects in Enniskerry Road, is currently under construction. Work on this development of 155 units began in July 2019.  It comprises 105 homes for social housing and 50 two bedroomed Cost Rental homes.  The Cost Rental units, which are scheduled for completion in 2021, will be offered for rental at &euro;1,200 per month. Land for the development is being provided by Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to help achieve these competitive rents, which represent a very significant reduction when compared with market rents in the Stepaside area. My Department is also providing &euro;4.5 million is Serviced Sites Funding to support infrastructure costs associated with the development.  </p>  <p>  The other pathfinder project is at Emmet Road in Inchicore, including the site of the former St Michael's Estate. Dublin City Council, the site owner, is continuing to make progress on the design and planning work for this project. DCC has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to move the project forward, and a development framework plan has recently been completed. It is projected that the site can accommodate 484 homes in a high-quality mixed tenure development, including 375 Cost Rental apartments. The remaining units will be provided for social housing. DCC is engaging with my Department according to the best practice guidelines set out in the Capital Works Management Framework, and is procuring an architect-led integrated design team which will be responsible for designing the scheme and taking it as far as the planning stage.  I am determined that work will continue to progress at pace on this project and that lessons learned from the financial modelling for this location are applied more broadly.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Cost Rental agenda more generally, the development of a national policy approach is being progressed by working group led by my Department and also involving the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other bodies. This will provide for a sustainable financing structure and allow us to commence the delivery of Cost Rental homes at scale.  Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for Cost Rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work. The work of the group will also be assisted by consultancy and research support which will be undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf. The EIB has extensive international experience in affordable housing, and is providing technical assistance in assessing the potential market for Cost Rental in Ireland. The development of a national model for Cost Rental will be concluded well in advance of the completion of construction work on the homes at the first pathfinder site on Enniskerry Road.</p></reply>

Provision was made for &euro;2.5 million of Exchequer funding to be made available to local authorities in 2018 for this purpose, increasing to &euro;4.5 million in 2019 and increasing further again, under Budget 2020, to &euro;6m next year, with the intention of ultimately achieving a targeted inspection coverage of 25% of rental properties annually by 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2018, 28,806 inspections were carried out, including repeat or follow up inspections in some cases. This was a 47% increase on the 19,645 inspections carried out in 2017, and I expect final data for this year to show a further significant increase. My Department will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that momentum is maintained towards the 25% target by 2021.</p></reply>

This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. </p>  <p>  Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 required all local authorities, if they had not already done so, to provide for CBL as a method of allocation for social housing in their allocation schemes by the end of 2016. The way in which CBL is implemented, including decisions on which properties are to be offered through it, is a matter for the individual authority concerned. However, it must be done in accordance with the relevant regulations and their own scheme of priority. </p>  <p>  Given the clear benefits offered by CBL, my Department continues to liaise with the local authorities to ensure that it is implemented as widely as possible across the country and has undertaken a number of surveys in both 2017 and 2018 to determine its uptake and impact.  Data garnered through these surveys has shown that over half of all local authorities are operating a CBL system while others are in the process of running pilot schemes with a view to wider roll out in their respective areas. Of those authorities that are operating CBL the expressed view is that it is having a positive effect on how they allocate houses. The data also shows that where CBL is in operation the rate of refusals has dropped. The survey for 2019 is currently underway.</p>  <p>  My Department hosted a workshop on CBL with representatives from the local authority sector on 15 November 2019. The aim of the workshop was to bring relevant officials from local authorities together and to provide a forum to discuss the potential for increasing the use of CBL across the State. The workshop also provided an opportunity to those authorities who, for various reasons, are not operating CBL to discuss the issues arising for their authorities. </p></reply>

Under the Scheme, ownership of LAGS sites is transferred to the Housing Agency which is tasked under Rebuilding Ireland with bringing forward these sites for development. </p><p>To set out a path to achieve housing development on LAGS lands, the Housing Agency published its LAGS Strategic Development and Management Plan in February 2018. This set out development proposals for all 73 sites, along with a further 13 sites also in their ownership. The plan identified 36 LAGS Sites as being Suitable for Immediate Development. The remaining 37 sites were categorised as Secondary Sites. The plan can be found on the Housing Agency website at .  </p><p>In terms of the development of the sites, the Housing Agency is prioritising those which are already serviced and which have with the most potential to deliver housing at scale in the short to medium term.  Currently 19 projects are being progressed across 17 LAGS sites which will deliver 788 social homes. Details of progress on these and other developments can be tracked through the Social Housing Construction Status Report. The latest report (Q2 2019) is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at https://rebuildingireland.ie/news/minister-murphy-publishes-social-housing-construction-status-report-for-q2-2019-2/. </p><p>Moreover, following on from the publication of the Land Aggregation Scheme Strategic Development and Management Plan, Expressions of Interest were sought from Approved Housing Bodies to work with the Agency to develop a number of sites not yet under development. Consequently, 18 further LAGS sites are now the subject of discussions between the Agency and a number of Approved Housing Bodies regarding development proposals for these sites. These 18 sites include 8 sites deemed Suitable for Immediate Development and 10 sites categorised as Secondary sites.

This includes 3 sites at Mount Avenue, Dundalk, Gibbet Hill Gracedieu Waterford, and Lissywollen in Westmeath which have been approved for funding of &euro;6.48m under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) which will stimulate the delivery of over 650 mixed tenure type homes. </p><p>The other 3 sites &lsquo;suitable for immediate development&rsquo; at Enniskery Road, Dun Laoghaire, St Joseph&rsquo;s Road Mallow, Cork and Hackettstown in Fingal have received funding approval of &euro;9.5m under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) to provide the necessary infrastructure so that more affordable homes discounted on open market prices can be delivered. As a result I envisage that  219 affordable homes will be provided on these sites.  </p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Housing Agency, the relevant local authorities, the Land Development Agency and Approved Housing Bodies with a view to delivering the optimum housing mix from Land Aggregation Scheme sites.</p></reply>

The National Student Accommodation Strategy was subsequently launched in July 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills in conjunction with Action 4.07 of Rebuilding Ireland. </p>  <p>  Identified measures in assisting the development of new student accommodation projects included reforms related to planning matters and to development finance which were then provided for in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. Firstly, under Action 4.13, the fast tracking of planning applications for construction projects with more than 200 student bedspaces was created under the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) route directly to An Bord Pleanala. </p>  <p>  As of the end October 2019, this has resulted in the granting of planning permissions for 7,573 student bedspaces nationally under the SHD procedure. In addition, legislative provisions (Action 4.11) were also created to facilitate financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes, specifically for new student accommodation projects. </p>  <p>  There has been a sustained increase in the planning and construction of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) nationally since the adoption of Rebuilding Ireland in 2016. As of the end of Q3, 2019, a total of 8,229 bed spaces have been completed since the adoption of Rebuilding Ireland.  This delivery exceeds the objective under Action 4.08 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring on stream 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there are a further 5,254 bed spaces on site and plans approved for an additional 7,771 bed spaces, representing a total of 21,254 bed spaces either complete, under construction or with plans granted at the end of Q3 2019 which indicates a strong pipeline of new student housing construction projects to continue growth to 2021 and beyond. </p>  <p>  Action 4.07 of Rebuilding Ireland referred to the scope for the provision of student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands. Circular letter PL8/2016 to local authorities encouraged their collaboration with the Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in developing student accommodation projects. To this end the &lsquo;State Lands Map&rsquo; was also published on the Rebuilding Ireland website in 2017 and this resource provides details and mapping of state owned lands including those controlled by the local authorities and the Housing Agency.  The HEIs have been made aware of this resource through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation established by the Department of Education and Skills and many are progressing plans to develop student accommodation.</p>  <p>  Efforts to expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector are identified in Action 4.10. My Department has provided funding of &euro;130,000 in the 2016-19 period to the Union of Students in Ireland in this regard to assist in funding a Student Housing Officer, training and other activities such as the #homesforstudy campaign. This initiative involves a website and other initiatives to encourage homeowners in targeted locations across the country to earn up to &euro;14,000 tax free under the rent-a-room scheme by accommodating a student. </p>  <p>  An additional provision has also been made for the UCD Students Union, who are outside the USI. A submission for further funding for the 2019/20 academic year has been made by the USI jointly to the Department of Education and Skills and my Department including proposals for continuing the #homesforstudy.ie campaign and other activities in the student accommodation area. This submission is being considered currently with a decision anticipated shortly.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by a once-off fund of &euro;10 million, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes. </p><p>Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative, that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link:  .</p><p>In July this year my Department launched the Multi-annual Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme.  The development of such a multi-annual funding programme was a key recommendation of the report on the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative. The National Development Plan published in February 2018, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 to support the Programme.  The Programme will enable the progressive resolution, on a priority basis, of substandard Developer Provided Water Services Infrastructure  - commonly called 'DPI',  much of which was installed in housing estates during the building boom of the late 1990's and early 2000's. These privately owned and temporary facilities provide mostly wastewater treatment, with a small number providing drinking water.  </p><p>The collaborative experience gained by the key stakeholders in implementing the Taking-in-Charge Initiative has informed the new Resolution Programme.  Bids were sought from local authorities around the country for funding under the Programme and the closing date was 18 September 2019.  A total number of 19 local authorities with Developer Provided Infrastructure in estates in their areas, made applications under the programme for support. </p><p>My Department is currently completing a preliminary evaluation and clarification process on the bids received with the local authorities. The intention is to shortly set up an Expert Panel to independently evaluate the bids and recommend suitable projects for funding. This evaluation will take place over the coming months. Membership of the Panel will include Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation in the Chair.</p><p>The Expert Panel will make recommendations to me on the suitability of projects for funding under the Programme, based on the criteria set out in the Framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. The Panel will report to my Department when their examination of the bids is concluded. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in early 2020 on approvals and allocations once that process is concluded and has been considered. </p></reply>

However, prior to the making of such an order, the Act requires that I review the operation and effectiveness of the SHD arrangements and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report of my conclusions of the review.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a Strategic Housing Development Review Group was established in June 2019. The Report of the Review Group was received on 24 September 2019.  The Report acknowledges that the SHD arrangements have generally been a success in meeting their objectives to contribute to addressing housing undersupply issues by providing a fast-track development consent process aimed at incentivising developers to bring forward applications for large-scale housing developments. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive contribution that the SHD arrangements have made, the Review Group notes that there continues to exist a deficit in housing supply and affirms that the original rationale for the introduction of the SHD arrangements remains. In light of these findings, the Review Group considers that there are sufficient grounds for extending the SHD arrangements until the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  I concur with the finding of the Review Group in this regard and propose to shortly sign an order to this effect. A report on my conclusions of the review, as well as the Review Group's Report, have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by the Act and copies of both reports are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  In addition, I have reflected on the views of the Review Group on the rate of activation of SHD sites, and I consider it appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner given the benefits the SHD arrangements provide.  Therefore, I consider that it would be appropriate to introduce a "use it or lose it" measure requiring developers to have commenced a certain level of development within a certain period of time on foot of a grant of an SHD planning permission and I intend bringing forward the necessary legislation in this regard in due course.</p></reply>

The legislative framework around protecting and conserving our natural heritage is further strengthened by legislation for the implementation of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species); the Licensing and Inspection of Zoos Regulations 2013; as well as more specific legislation introduced in 2018 to tackle the threat posed by invasive alien species of crayfish; and regulations introduced earlier this year to implement the EU ABS Regulation, which puts in place a more equitable system for the sharing of benefits arising from use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge.</p>  <p>  While animal health and welfare generally comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the context of my Department's wide-ranging remit, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has a function in relation to policy on wildlife crime, with respect of species listed in the appendices to CITES, particularly the provenance of specimens, and with respect to the welfare and conditions of animals in zoos in Ireland and communicates on a regular basis with stakeholders and actors in these areas, including those named. </p>  <p>  The role of non-governmental organisations and stakeholders is important and valued. My Department maintains productive relationships with a wide range of NGOs, stakeholders and conservation groups. Furthermore, environmental NGOS are represented on the Biodiversity Forum, an independent advisory group set up to advise the Minister on the implementation of the National Biodiversity Plan which usually convenes 2 or 3 times each year. </p>  <p>  Representatives of the National Parks and Wildlife Service meet with stakeholders and conservation groups on a regular basis in the course of carrying out their duties. These meetings are often conducted by personnel from the NPWS Regional Management structure. While there may have been additional routine or ad-hoc meetings / communications between NPWS and representatives of stakeholders or NGOs during the period referred to in the question, the following meetings took place during that time:     </p>  <p>- NPWS Eastern Division met with senior personnel from one of the named organisations on 17 September 2019. The purpose of the meeting was an annual review of an MOU that exists between that organisation and NPWS. </p>  <p>- The Irish Red Grouse Conservation Trust met with NPWS in NPWS Kildare Regional Office on 5 September 2019. </p>  <p>- NPWS is represented on a multi-agency group dealing with animal welfare in Wicklow. This group last met on 24 September 2019. It includes representatives from the following bodies - Wicklow SPCA, ISPCA and Irish Horse Welfare Trust. Wicklow County Council is also represented.</p>  <p>- The Irish Red Grouse Conservation Trust and Irish Kennel Club members met with NPWS Regional Management to trial a survey method in Slieve Blooms Mountains Nature Reserve,  27 September 2019.</p>  <p>  Ministerial diaries are available on the Department's website: www.chg.gov.ie/about/ministers/ministers-diary/.</p>  <p>  In the period under review, a senior official of my Department discussed the subject matter of this question with an Official of one of the named organisations and met too with the Irish Council Against Blood Sports.</p>  <p>  On Friday last, 15 November a senior official met the CEO of the second named organisation on a range of welfare issues.</p></reply>

New zones will be added on an ongoing basis if further positive tests arise and, in these new zones, the capturing of hares will have to cease immediately and coursing will only be possible with already captured hares, where the hares are certified in writing by a veterinary surgeon as being healthy, and such hares will only be released on foot of further such certification.</p></reply>

For the Deputy's convenience the relevant material is set out as follows.</p><p>In  2017 expenditure of &euro;64,167 was incurred in respect of social media relating to the  Creative Ireland programme.  This arose from a comprehensive citizen engagement programme to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering and to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore required a sustained communications programme in 2017.  A combination of approaches and platforms were used to maximise impact, taking account of the diversity of the target audiences.  Further information is available on my Department's Creative Ireland website.</p><p>During 2018 Creative Ireland undertook a four week campaign from mid-May to mid-June 2018 on regional radio and social media  to promote the 500 events taking place across the country as part of the inaugural Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g day of creativity for children and young people.  Three bespoke videos were produced to support and raise awareness of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - Ireland's new national day of Creativity for children and young people - at a cost of &euro;24,815.</p><p>In addition to promoting interest in specific initiatives such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, social media is also actively used to support and promote the Creative Ireland Programme generally as well as specific creative endeavours and partner activities.  During 2018, specific short videos were also commissioned to promote various aspects or pillars of the Creative Ireland Programme. These included a specially commissioned spoken word piece by Stephen James Smith to mark the publication of 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Strategies in September accompanied by five short videos to illustrate the breadth and range of activities supported by the local authority Creative Ireland Programmes; and a video to mark the roll out of the Creative Schools initiative in 150 schools nationwide, in partnership with the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Skills. </p><p>  All these videos are available at www.creativeireland.gov.ie/en.  </p><p>  A full breakdown of all costs in 2018 in relation to these activities is published on the Creative Ireland Website. <table>    <tr>       <th>Creative Ireland Expenditure Summary </th>       <th>2018 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Regional radio &amp;amp; social media campaign </td>       <td>&euro;48,780 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g videos </td>       <td>&euro;24,815 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Creative Ireland Programme  </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social Media content - uploading of articles daily throughout 2018 </td>       <td>&euro;66,420 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 videos </td>       <td>&euro;93,110 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am also advised that the Culture Ireland Unit of my Department engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.  Total expenditure on this contract was &euro;51,400.</p><p>The Department also engaged D&rsquo;Arcy Marketing and BigO at a cost of &euro;17,466 and &euro;6,125 respectively to promote awareness of the 2018 European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) campaign for the recruitment of Irish language translators to the institutions of the European Union.</p></reply>
