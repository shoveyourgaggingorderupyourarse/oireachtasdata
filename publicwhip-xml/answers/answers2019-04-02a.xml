    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200052#WRA00600"><p>The TEN-T Core Network is a subset of the Comprehensive Network and represents the strategically most important nodes and links of the trans-European transport networks. </p>  <p>  The Core TEN-T network on the Island of Ireland links the main urban centres of Belfast-Dublin and Cork and encompasses the road, rail and other transport modes on this route. There is also an offshoot to  the Core Port  of Shannon Foynes. The Dublin - Rosslare Europort rail line links to Rosslare Harbour, a Harbour which is on the TEN-T Comprehensive Network but which doesn&rsquo;t meet the threshold for TEN-T Core port status. I have not applied to the European Commission to designate the Dublin to Rosslare railway line as part of the Core Network.</p>  <p>  EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc, wrote to Ministers in February 2019 announcing that the Commission is considering advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. My Department will be making a formal submission to the Commission in April 2019 requesting an early review of the TEN-T Network, as outlined in the Programme for a Partnership Government. This submission will note that national developments since the TEN-T network was established should be taken into account during the review, including the National Development Plan, the National Planning Framework, and the implications of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy will be aware that Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T Network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being seleted in the evaluation process.</p>  <p>  The current CEF programme finishes at end 2020. A proposal for a new Regulation of the Connecting Europe Facility for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018. Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.</p>  <p>  Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, includingthe rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant Calls for Proposals.</p></reply>

Over 12,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  <b></b></p><p>The most recent fully completed round of the programme was the 2017 round. Under this 2017 round a record 2,320 application were submitted and &euro;62m was allocated to 1,837 individual projects. The exact amount allocated to each project was based on a formula which combined the assessment score obtained, the amount of funding sought and the total amount of funding available for that county based on a per-capita basis. The full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department&rsquo;s website prior to any assessments commencing. Ministers were presented with a list of applications and a proposed monetary allocation for each valid application and no subsequent changes to these amounts were made.  Further details of the allocation process are available in the Review of the 2017 Sports Capital Programme which is published on the Department's website at  .</p><p>Work is now under way on the assessment of applications under the 2018 round of the SCP and again the full scoring system and assessment manual was published on the Department's website before the detailed assessment work commenced.</p><p>In relation to future funding of larger sports projects, the National Sports Policy was published on 25th July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years. The fund was launched in November 2018 and is open to applications until 17<sup>th</sup>April 2019. Full details of the new Fund are available on the Department's website. The fund will initially focus on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities and they will be required to prioritise their projects and certify that their proposals accord with their development strategies and plans. As with the SCP, it is envisaged that the full scoring system will be published prior to any assessment work commencing.</p><p>The SCP and the LSSIF are managed in a transparent and open manner as set out above. While the programmes will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, I have no plans to move responsibility for sports capital grants.</p></reply>

While I have not met with either Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or water clubs in the harbour to discuss the proposal, I understand that Minister Ross did meet a delegation on September 2016 to discuss general issues regarding the harbour including the proposal for a National Watersports Centre. </p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy was published on 25th July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years. The fund was launched in November 2018 and is open to applications until 17th April 2019. Full details of the terms and conditions of the scheme are available on the Department's website. Until proposals are received and assessed it is not possible to suggest the number of projects that will benefit from the fund although I do envisage a high level of demand for the funding available. The fund will initially focus on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities, all of which received letters inviting them to make applications. Accordingly, it is open to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council or any of the relevant water sport National Governing Bodies to make an application under the scheme for any project considered suitable.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200052#WRA01300"><p>I have no doubt that the Deputy welcomes the fact we have public bike schemes in most of our major cities, including Galway. These schemes have an important role to play in fostering a cycling culture and providing an alternative, sustainable transport option within the cities. I can also inform the House that there are advanced plans to extend the scheme to Waterford, and I understand the National Transport Authority (NTA) expects to commence rolling out a scheme in that city toward the end of this year. </p>  <p>  I recognise of course that investment in schemes such as these requires investment in our cycling infrastructure also. In that regard, as Minister, I have significantly increased the amount of funding available to support the development of improved cycling infrastructure and I know the NTA is working closely with the local authorities in all the main cities to improve cycle lanes and tracks and encourage greater usage of cycling.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware, the arrangements for the public bike schemes are a matter in which, as Minister, I have no direct role; instead these schemes and decisions about them come within the functions of the National Transport Authority (NTA), and the relevant contract is between the NTA and a particular company.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in May 2014, the NTA awarded a contract for the supply, installation, maintenance and on-going operation of Public Bike Share Schemes in Cork, Limerick and Galway to a company known as Telfourth Limited. </p>  <p>  The term of the contract was for five years, with an option to extend by a further period of up to five years, at the discretion of the NTA. Accordingly, the original contract was due to expire in mid-May 2019.  </p>  <p>  Obviously a decision in regard to the contract needed to be made well in advance of its expiry in May this year. Key elements of the hardware and software pertaining to bike schemes are specific to different operators, with patents and intellectual property rights applying in many cases.  This means sufficient time would be required for any newly contracted party to put in place their own systems, docking stations, kiosks and bikes etc.</p>  <p>  The NTA therefore considered the issue of the contract last year and in accordance with the terms of the original contract the NTA approved the extension of the contract with Telfourth Limited for a further five-year period, commencing this May and running until May 2024.</p></reply>

Maintaining the highest standards of safety in Irish aviation is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has statutory responsibility for regulating and enforcing safety standards in civil aviation in Ireland, with a remit to ensure that Irish industry complies with the highest European standards. These standards are prescribed in EU Regulation 2018/1139, which was updated and endorsed by the European Parliament and the European Council in July of last year.  Overseen by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Regulation represents a comprehensive set of aircraft and flight safety rules that applies across all Member States, to all aircraft registered and operating within the European Union.  All matters of aviation safety are coordinated and addressed at a pan-European level under the auspices of EASA, and that wil continue to be the case.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific matter of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, the Deputy will note that on March 12, the IAA suspended the operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into and out of Irish airspace.  This suspension, which was reinforced across the EU by EASA later the same day, will remain in place as a precautionary measure to ensure the continued safety of passengers and flight crew.  It will not be removed until such times as there are acceptable grounds to have confidence in the safety of the aircraft model.  All further action in relation to the treatment of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will be done in close coordination with EASA.  </p>  <p>  I am not willing to comment on what may or may not arise from the ongoing investigations into the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, however, I can assure this House that only aircraft which are safety assured &ndash; to European standards - will be allowed to operate in Irish airspace.  </p>  <p>  The IAA remains in close contact with EASA and other national aviation safety authorities on this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200052#WRA01900"><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the NTA is the statutory body with responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service contracts.</p><p>The NTA also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  </p><p>The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services. In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide just over &euro;300m in subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.</p><p>The BusConnects programme for Dublin will see the transformation of Dublin's bus system, so that journeys by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  Part of this programme is to simplify the fares structure, to encourage interchange between services and modes of travel and to reduce boarding times.  <b></b></p><p>A revised fare structure is required for transport in the city which will easily allow seamless movement between different transport services without financial penalty.  The last NTA fares determination published in October 2018, follows on from the 2017 determination by taking another step toward this new fare structure.  </p><p>Under BusConnects the NTA proposes to move to two main fares namely, a short distance similar to the current 1-3 stages fare on buses in Dublin and a 90-minute fare which will allow travel on bus, LUAS or DART or any combination of those three PSO public transport services for 90 minutes.  In its last fares determination, the NTA adjusted the Dublin City bus fares towards the two fare system.  However, it will take at least one other fares determination later this year, before the two fare system is finally in place.</p><p>Last year we saw an increase of almost 16 million passenger journeys provided by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Luas and Go-Ahead Ireland on PSO services.  That is an increase of over 6% compared to 2017.  I think the Deputy would agree that this increase in passenger growth is very positive.  The growth in public transport services has been supported by higher levels of subvention in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and as I mentioned earlier it was increased again this year to provide a total allocation of over &euro;300m.</p><p>Finally, the &euro;8.6bn capital investment programme for public transport under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow us to continue investing in our public transport to ensure we can accommodate the future growth in passenger numbers in the years ahead.</p></reply>

The next review of the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area must be completed by 2021 and that review will reconsider the population and commuting forecasts in order to determine whether any revised Strategy might include such an extension. </p>  <p>  Currently the Kingscourt area is served by bus based public transport and I note that the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area categorises the M3/N2 route as a core regional bus network and the area will therefore benefit from the planned improvements along that corridor under Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  I can therefore confirm to the Deputy that there is no funding allocated under Project Ireland 2040 for the disused Kingscourt rail line.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  During the recession there were substantial cutbacks in the funding available for State grants for national, regional and local road programmes.  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some time to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. Grants in the three main grant categories (Restoration Improvement, Discretionary Grant and Restoration Maintenance) are allocated based on the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area of responsibility and it is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis. </p>  <p>  There is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes and any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget. </p>  <p>  I have been pleased to be able to allocate significantly increased grant funding to Meath County Council in respect of regional and local roads over the last two years. In this context grant allocations to Meath in 2019 total &euro;19,676,500 which is an increase of over 45% compared to the 2017 allocation.</p></reply>

In December, additional off-peak services, and some timetabling changes of other services were also introduced, all with the objective of providing additional capacity on the Line.</p>  <p>  In the medium term, the challenge is to source additional rolling stock as efficiently and effectively as possible and ensuring value for money for the taxpayer in that regard.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently exploring two options -</p>  <p>  1. The purchase or lease of second-hand fleet;</p>  <p>  2. The purchase of additional carriages to augment the existing &ldquo;ICR&rdquo; commuter fleet.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the first option is complicated by the different gauge of the Irish rail network compared to international norms; however, the NTA has recently advertised seeking expressions of interest and is currently considering the responses it received, as well as the proposal to purchase additional carriages. I expect a decision on the medium term response to the capacity challenge will be made very shortly. </p>  <p>  In the longer term, and as part of the DART Expansion programme generally, there is a need to significantly increase the size of the rail fleet.  Work on developing tender documentation and train specifications for the proposed bi-mode fleet of rail vehicles is progressing.  It is expected that the formal fleet acquisition tender process will be initiated in the coming months and that the fleet</p>  <p>  manufacturing contract will be awarded either at the end of this year or the start of next year.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to- day operations of public transport.</p><p>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. </p><p>Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access and audio/visual aids, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Newer systems such as LUAS are fully accessible. </p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) for the period 2018-2027, sets out the national vision and ambition for the delivery of key critical infrastructure over the next 10 years, including in relation to public transport infrastructure.  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are being considered under the NDP over the period to 2027.</p><p>As with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design. There will also be a continued investment programme under the NDP to fund retro-fitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility.</p><p>However, work remains to be done in terms of the retro-fitting of older infrastructure to make it accessible for people with a disability. In particular, gaps remain in relation to railway infrastructure and facilities as most of the rail network was originally developed during the Victorian era. </p><p>To address infrastructural legacy issues, my Department funds a programme of accessibility improvement grants, managed by the NTA, to upgrade existing and older infrastructure and facilities, such as</p><p>- the installation of accessible bus stops, </p><p>- upgrading train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users, and </p><p>- providing grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) into the taxi fleet. </p><p>Last year I asked the NTA to provide information on the cost of making public transport services wheelchair accessible.</p><p>The information provided by the NTA, and other related information, is available on my Department's website at .  For the assistance of the Deputy, I have outlined in the table the cost figures provided by the NTA, of making public transport services wheelchair accessible.<table><tr><th>Bus Stations</th><th>Bus/Coaches<br /><br />PSO Services</th><th>Bus Stops<br /><br />PSO Coach Services</th><th>Train Stations</th><th>Taxis/Hackneys</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;16.35 m</td><td>&euro;22.5 m</td><td>&euro;10 m</td><td>&euro;76 m</td><td>&euro;214 m</td><td>&euro;339 m</td></tr></table></p><p>I would emphasise that the figures provided by the NTA are estimates, due for example to complexities in relation to providing accessible bus stops in rural/regional areas. In addition, the figures relate to Public Service Obligation (PSO) services only, and to Exchequer funding rather than industry costs in the case of Taxi/Hackneys.</p></reply>

However, they will need to carry the Green Card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached in the meantime.  </p>  <p>  It is possible that some policies may not cover driving in the UK  in the event of a no-deal Brexit. I would therefor advise drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain to check their motor insurance policies and, if in doubt, check with their insurers that such travel would be covered. </p>  <p>  The position taken by authorities in Northern Ireland and Britain in relation to Green Cards for vehicles entering their jurisdiction from the EU in the event of a no deal Brexit is a matter for those authorities.</p></reply>

It also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme which now operates under the Local Link brand.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, &ldquo;Realising our Rural Potential&rdquo;, contains a number of commitments in relation to public transport initiatives in rural areas, ie Actions 252-255 and 257. The Department of Rural and Community Development, which has responsibility for &ldquo;Realising our Rural Potential&rdquo;, publishes Progress Reports on all Actions in the Plan, including initiatives relating to public transport in rural areas.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of public transport services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas. The NTA is continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its contracted services, including improvements to many non-urnban services made last year with more changes planned for this year. The increased funding has also enabled the introduction of 66 new commuter services into the Local Link network, operating five, six or seven days per week, as well as demand-responsive services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I tasked the NTA to examine the potential to extend existing Local Link services into the evening. Subsequently, the NTA approved funding for 65 new pilot evening and late night Local Link services, operating across all 26 counties, to run on a pilot basis for 6 months to end December last. Following a review of the services by the NTA, the pilot was extended until end quarter 1 2019, to allow the NTA to conduct a further review of the performance of the services.</p></reply>

The Local Authority needs to come to an agreement with one local sports club, whose lands surround the swimming pool, prior to proceeding.  It would be expected that any works to the pool could cause significant disruption to the activities of the local sports club.  For example, access and egress by construction traffic to the swimming pool site, the storage of construction materials close to the site, and potential cordoning off of the site during construction.   </p>  <p>  Over the last number of years, the sports club and the Local Authority have engaged on how best to move forward with the swimming pool renovation project.  Progress has been quite slow due to a wide range of complex issues.  The issue was brought to my attention and I discussed it with my official who in turn consulted Sport Ireland.  Sport Ireland has experience in resolving sport related disputes and grievances and use a panel of experienced facilitators in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Given the relatively slow pace of progress in recent years, my official suggested to the Local Authority and the sports club that the services of a facilitator might be useful.  Both parties were agreeable and Sport Ireland recommended some facilitators who might be suitable.  My official contacted one of the facilitators, Mr. Austin Kenny, and Mr. Kenny agreed to facilitate discussions between the Local Authority and the sports club.  I understand that discussions between the Local Authority and the sports club commenced soon afterwards.  I further understand that considerable detailed technical work is underway by both parties and that once this work is completed, more material discussions will take place.</p>  <p>  Facilitation is a voluntary process entered into by the relevant parties.  The status of the ongoing mediation process, along with terms of reference, timelines and costs, is a matter for the relevant parties.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland would, from time to time, advise NGBs on dispute resolution, including efficient approaches to mediation, facilitation and arbitration.  Requests from NGBs for assistance with the costs of facilitation are considered by Sport Ireland and are treated on their merits.</p></reply>

At its meeting on 11 December 2018, the Government decided to give greater immediate priority to the preparations for a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit. This work is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and involves all Government Departments and agencies.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, along with other Government Departments, has emphasised the importance of stakeholders taking all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. I would encourage haulage operators to refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of transport and the basic connectivity Regulation.</p></reply>

No. 563/2015 - Irish Aviation Authority (Small Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) and Rockets) Order, 2015.  To date over 10,000 drones and model aircraft have been registered.  </p>  <p>  A key objective of regulation is to prevent unintentional misuse of drones which may lead to safety or security concerns.  Correct operation of drones offer many benefits in a wide range of economic and social areas; however misuse can be harmful.  </p>  <p>  There are robust and effective drone management systems and procedures in place at the State airports which have proven effective in managing the response to the incursion at Dublin Airport on 21 February and in minimising the impact on schedules. Following that event, an Ad Hoc Meeting on Drones was hosted by my Department where a discussion with key stakeholders took place regarding safety, security and operational impacts of drones at airports. </p>  <p>  As an action from the meeting, my Department and the IAA are jointly seeking to organise a symposium in May bringing together some leading international experts on drones and the relevant stakeholders in Ireland with a view to considering possible improvements to our current arrangements for managing the threat posed by drones in the aviation sector in particular. </p>  <p>  European Union regulation in relation to the registration and operation of drones will take effect next year. More specifically, the European Aviation Safety Agency proposals for a unified set of drone rules for all EU countries were approved at the end of February and the Implementing Regulation is expected to be published in early summer 2019 and to become applicable 12 months later (June 2020).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.131.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200054#WRC01300"><p>According to the most recent estimates from the Environment Protection Agency (2017), the national public transport fleet, encompassing rail, buses and small public service vehicles (SPSVs), represents just over 4% of all transport emissions. While no specific carbon emission reduction targets have been set for public transport I firmly believe that the sector has a strong leadership role in normalising the use of alternative fuels and technologies.</p>  <p>  A programme of work is currently under way to promote the use of alternative fuels and to maximise the potential contribution of public transport towards reducing our overall transport emissions profile. Project Ireland 2040 has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the coming years to 2027. This investment will enable the sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing transport demand associated with growing population and employment. Major sustainable transport projects planned include BusConnects, investment in the DART Expansion Programme; and the MetroLink; as well as the multi-annual urban cycling and walking infrastructure investment of over &euro;110 million underway for our main cities.</p>  <p>  In relation to the national bus fleet, as the Deputy will be aware, the NDP has committed us to no longer purchase diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from July 2019.   Under the BusConnects programme, which is to be administered by the National Transport Authority, by 2023, half of the Dublin bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be converted, with plans for full conversion by 2030. The programme is expected to be expanded to include urban bus fleets in Cork, Galway and potentially Limerick and Waterford. In preparation for this transition, my Department has undertaken a series of bus trials which are expected to conclude in April 2019. The findings from the trials will be considered, along with other research and market information, to inform the future direction of bus procurement.</p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise the potential contribution of electrified rail to our decarbonisation objectives. Over the coming years an estimated &euro;2 billion will be invested in the DART Expansion Programme which is a series of projects that will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin, with all of the lines linked and connected. High-frequency electrified services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway are envisaged under the Programme. It will also include new stations to provide interchange with bus, LUAS and Metro networks. It is also expected that in 2022, Ireland will accept delivery of its first new diesel-electric trains which will enable the enlargement of the rail fleet by approximately some 300 new rail carriages. These major rail projects will help supplement the range of viable low carbon alternatives to private passenger car travel and positively impact our sectoral emissions profile.</p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the SPSV sector (taxis, hackneys and limousines); in line with our ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland will be zero-emission capable, it is clear that electrification presents an achievable pathway towards decarbonisation. To this end, the Electric SPSV Grant Scheme was established by my Department and opened to applicants in February 2018, providing purchase grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, available in addition to the range of other incentives and supports for electric vehicles. &euro;500,000 has been allocated from my Department's Green Public Transport Fund in support of the initiative in 2019.</p></reply>

Under this  Agreement the Government is committed to provide funding of &pound;75 million (sterling) towards the cost of Phase 1a of the A5 upgrade scheme.  The aim of this commitment was to facilitate the delivery of this phase of the scheme as soon as possible once the planning process in Northern Ireland was concluded. </p>  <p>  As part of the Capital Plan Review in 2017 financial provision was made for meeting the Government's commitment regarding the A5 in 3 tranches over the period 2019 to 2021.  When those allocations were put in place it was anticipated that the planning process would have concluded and construction of the 1st phase started before now.  </p>  <p>  However, legal challenges to the approval of the scheme have resulted in unavoidable delays to the timeframe for implementation of the scheme.  Following judicial review proceedings last year the scheme approval was quashed. </p>  <p>  In the absence of the Northern Ireland Executive I  do not currently have a counterpart and the North South Ministerial Council has not been meeting.  However, liaison is continuing, including meetings of the Senior Officials Group comprising Northern and Southern officials established to oversee implementation of the Fresh Start Agreement.  </p>  <p>  Allowing for the time required by the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure (DfI) to review work previously undertaken on the scheme and implement necessary statutory procedures, it was evident, following liaison at official level, that the initial &euro;27 million tranche of funding would not be drawn down this year and would need to be rolled forward.  As was the case for previous Government contributions, it is envisaged that payments towards the cost of the A5 will be based on an agreed protocol and linked to the achievement of construction stage milestones.  Funding has been assured from 2020 onwards.</p></reply>

That subsidy amounts to around &euro;140 million each year and is paid in accordance with the Public Services Contract that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has entered into with the NTA.</p><p>So the Deputy can see we have improved the funding framework which in turn has allowed the National Transport Authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann deliver an improved passenger experience. </p><p>Such improvements to date include:</p><p>- Introduction of 10 minute DART services;</p><p>- All peak-time DART services operated by 6 or 8-car train sets only;</p><p>- Additional off-peak capacity added to the Kildare Line, Maynooth and Northern Line services;</p><p>- Increased usage of the Phoenix Park Tunnel for Kildare Line services;</p><p>- Improved journey times on a number of key Intercity routes; and</p><p>- The roll-out of the City Centre Re-signalling Project, which will improve train movements thereby providing improved passenger capacity across the network.</p><p>Those are all immediate measures but obviously I know there are other medium and longer-term measures required, and key to those measures is the provision of additional rail fleet.</p><p>In the medium term, the challenge is to source additional rolling stock as efficiently and effectively as possible and ensuring value for money for the taxpayer in that regard.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently exploring two options  &ndash; </p><p>1. The purchase or lease of second-hand fleet;</p><p>2. The purchase of additional carriages to augment the existing &ldquo;ICR&rdquo; commuter fleet.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the first option is complicated by the different gauge of the Irish rail network; however, the NTA has recently advertised seeking expressions of interest and is currently considering the responses it received, as well as the proposal to purchase additional carriages. I expect a decision on the medium term response to the capacity challenge will be made very shortly.</p><p>In the longer term, and as part of the DART Expansion programme generally, there is a need to significantly increase the size of the rail fleet.  Work on developing tender documentation and train specifications for the proposed bi-mode fleet of rail vehicles is progressing.  It is expected that the formal fleet acquisition tender process will be initiated in the coming months and that the fleet manufacturing contract will be awarded either at the end of this year or the start of next year.</p><p>I hope therefore the Deputy can recognise that there are a number of short, medium and longer-term measures underway which are designed to deal with the very welcome increased numbers of passengers availing of our rail network.</p></reply>

These are common internationally and give assurance that policy remains up to date and relevant to changing future circumstances.  The White Paper provides that these reviews are to have a three yearly cycle, with every second review being more comprehensive in nature and styled a Strategic Defence Review.  The White Paper specified that the first in this new cycle of reviews would be a White Paper Update, which is well underway and close to completion.</p>  <p>  The current White Paper Update is being overseen by a high-level civil-military Steering Group that meets regularly to review progress and the overall approach.  Since September last year when the Group first met, it has met on a further five occasions to date.  The Steering Group is chaired at Assistant Secretary level in my Department and membership also comprises the Defence Forces' Assistant Chief of Staff and the heads of my Department's Planning &amp;amp; Organisation Branch and the Defence Forces' Strategic Planning Branch.  Minutes of all meetings of the Group are taken by an Assistant Principal from my Department.  Minutes are not being published while the Update process continues.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides that consideration will be given to whether future reviews will be placed on a statutory footing. The necessity to legislate, or otherwise, is one of a number of issues upon which I am currently deliberating, in the context of the requirement to establish these reviews as a permanent feature of our approach to defence policy.  Another relevant aspect of my current deliberations is the question of the extent of consultation that should be carried out as part of such future reviews.  In seeking to establish these reviews on a consensual basis, I decided to seek the input of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, and I wrote to the Committee in August 2018 to obtain their views.  In response, the Committee met with me recently to convey their views thus concluding this element of the process.</p></reply>

This is in accordance with the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, which provides for an overall capital allocation of &euro;541m for Defence for the period 2018 to 2022. This capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructure development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified in the White Paper, over the lifetime of the Plan.</p>  <p>  My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government as set out on the White Paper on Defence. </p>  <p>  This funding emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to deliver on all the roles assigned by Government. </p>  <p>  The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  In addition to investment in equipment, the capital programme provides for a sustained programme of investment in physical infrastructure in respect of a range of barracks modernisation and refurbishment projects.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with a multi role vessel (MRV). It is the Government&rsquo;s intent that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The acquisition of a modern vessel will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the State&rsquo;s principal seagoing agency, are maintained to the greatest extent and takes account of the overall policy approach in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  Planning is ongoing on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV.  The design and configuration of the vessel, including the approach to helicopter flight operations, will be considered as part of the planning process.  This procurement is, of course, subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded.</p></reply>

The Operation has so far contributed to the apprehension of 151 suspected smugglers and traffickers, removed approximately 550 boats from criminal organisations availability, contributed to over 300 Safety of Life at Sea events and rescued almost 45,000 migrants. </p>  <p>  The UN migration agency (IOM) has been compiling migrant arrival data across the Mediterranean since 2014 and has reported that the number of migrants arriving by sea has continued to drop and the numbers arriving in 2018 were the lowest since the crisis began. </p>  <p>  Operation Sophia specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the Southern Central Mediterranean by taking action against the criminal networks and disrupting the smugglers business model.  By improving maritime security Operation Sophia is actively contributing to EU and international efforts for the return of stability in Libya.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that this mission is only one part of the EU response to addressing the causes and not just the symptoms of the crisis.  Irish troops are contributing to the EU's efforts as part of EUTM Mali and Ireland participates in CSDP civilian missions in the Sahel region - EUCAF Sahel Niger and EUCAP Sahel Mali as well as to EUBAM Libya.  All of these are CSDP missions supported by a UN mandate. </p>  <p>  I am deeply troubled by the grave and on-going abuses perpetrated against migrants and refugees in Libya. Instability and lawlessness in Libya is also a major cause for concern.  That lawlessness and instability lies at the heart of the migrant crisis and the insecurity and dreadful conditions the migrants face both in transit through Africa and in Libya.  These problems can only be solved by the Libyan national authorities in taking control of their borders and their territorial waters, restoring law and order, and countering the activities of criminals and people smugglers operating out of Libya.</p>  <p>  EU Member States agreed in December 2018 to extend the mandate for Operation Sophia for a period of three months (a technical roll-over).  This was to provide time for a solution to be found in relation to the disembarkation of migrants rescued under this mission. Further discussions took place last week at EU level in relation to renewing the mandate beyond the 31st March 2019.</p>  <p>  As no solution on the issue of the disembarkation of rescued migrants has been found, a decision was adopted on 29th March to extend the mandate of Operation Sophia for 6 months with a temporary suspension of its naval assets while Member States continue working on a solution related to disembarkation.</p>  <p>  The Operation mandate will continue to be implemented through strengthening surveillance by air assets as well as reinforcing training support to the Libyan Coastguard and Navy.  Member States have also highlighted the importance of continuing to work closely with the Libyan authorities and international organisations to improve the protection of refugees and migrants in Libya.</p>  <p>  Given these developments, it is difficult to speculate at this time if we will deploy a naval vessel to a future Sophia operation as we would need to see the mission mandate and the role the Naval Service might be able to play in that regard.</p></reply>

Numerous commemorative events took place throughout the year including a State Ceremony in Dublin Castle on 24th June 2018 and a high level event at the United Nations Headquarters in New York in July. At all of these ceremonies and indeed whenever an appropriate opportunity has arisen to date in the course of my work as Minister with Responsibility for Defence, I am very proud to acknowledge and promote  the professionalism, the bravery and the commitment to peace and humanitarism that lies at the core of the Defence Forces' engagement as peacekeepers.</p>  <p>   Protection of civilians and ensuring the protection of human rights lie at the core of UN missions and the responsibilities of UN peacekeepers.  Training in human rights and humanitarian law is a fundamental part of the mission training for all deploying personnel.  It is also a key part of the training we provide within the EU Training Mission in Mali.  </p>  <p>  Last week I attended the United Nations Peacekeeping Conference in New York and I took the opportunity to once again highlight, at the highest level, the contribution that Irish military personnel have made to peacekeeping through their participation in many missions world-wide. I also on behalf of Ireland, pledged continued and enhanced training support by our Defence Forces for Troop Contributing Countries.</p></reply>

This arose from the difficulties posed in the past in terms of processing applications for re-entry. Previously, in the absence of a standard policy for dealing with requests to re-enter, each case was dealt with on an individual basis and governed by the rules, regulations and circumstances that applied at the time. </p>  <p>  The processing of such applications in the absence of a defined policy framework posed a number of difficulties such as defining procedures, identifying the requirements and needs of the organisation and agreeing terms and conditions with the individual. In order to allow for a transparent scheme to facilitate the re-entry of former Officers of the PDF, a policy framework, setting out terms and conditions was necessary. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions for the recommissioning scheme include the provision that the re-commissioning of former officers of the PDF shall only be considered in specific circumstances. These are where the Chief of Staff has identified a deficiency in personnel, military capability or expertise in the PDF, that cannot be resolved in a sustainable or timely manner from within existing personnel resources. </p>  <p>  Recommissioned officers will be offered a short service commission for a period of 3 years and in that period they cannot compete for promotion, nor will they block a promotion opportunity for existing Officers. The recommissioned Officers may only be offered a substantive appointment after 3 years on the advice of the Chief of Staff and Secretary General. </p>  <p>  This provides a fair and balanced approach to both the former officer and existing members. It is not realistic to suggest that vacancies should be maintained indefinitely for the purpose of ensuring promotions for existing members. To date, the number of expressions of interest is in low single figures.</p>  <p>  While this scheme is in place for former Officers of the PDF, the attendant scheme for enlisted personnel is still being progressed and will involve a change in Regulations.</p></reply>

Ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement will enable both sides to negotiate a future relationship agreement, with the aim of avoiding tariffs and quotas, and to help protect the thriving trading relationship between Ireland and the UK.</p>  <p>  However, the Government continues to advance preparedness and contingencies measures for all eventualities, including a no deal Brexit. The Comprehensive Contingency Action Plan published in December, and updated in January, sets out the whole-of-Government response to implement measures to mitigate the impact of a no deal Brexit. Ireland is committed to protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union, membership of which is a core element of our economic strategy.</p>  <p>Work is well advanced in respect of our approach in a no deal scenario. We are working with the European Commission and our EU partners to ensure that any potential disruption as a result of necessary additional checks and controls at our ports and airports needed to protect the Single Market is kept to a minimum.  This includes the development of temporary infrastructure at ports and airports. We are also advancing plans for permanent infrastructure which will provide for additional controls on a longer term basis.</p>  <p>  My department, including officials at embassies London and Paris, stands ready to assist Irish traders and private citizens who might experience problems at UK or French ports, should there be a disorderly UK withdrawal. </p>  <p>  Regarding trade with Northern Ireland, Ireland and the EU are at one in our determination to do all we can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect the peace process. As co-guarantors, the Irish and British Governments will continue to have our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Our discussions with the European Commission are ongoing, and have intensified on how to avoid a hard border in the case of no deal, while also protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland&rsquo;s place in them.    All options are being discussed within the rules of the Customs Union and Single Market.</p>  <p>  Without a Withdrawal Agreement, avoiding a hard border would become more complex and challenging. There are no easy answers.   If the UK decides to leave without the Withdrawal Agreement, a short term, temporary solution for trade will be required. Such a solution will be suboptimal compared to the backstop, and, while we are absolutely determined to avoid physical infrastructure at the border, it would be difficult to avoid serious disruption to the functioning of the all-island economy. The seamless trade we enjoy today would not be possible, and the benefits of the backstop for businesses in Northern Ireland will be lost, at least in the short term.</p>  <p>  For any sustainable long term solution, it would be impossible to escape the need for close alignment with the Single Market and Customs Union. The UK&rsquo;s own no deal papers say that they will quickly need talks with the EU and Ireland to get a deal to avoid a hard border. For us, the backstop will be the starting point for these discussions.</p>  <p>  I would state again, however, that the Withdrawal Agreement, negotiated by the UK and the EU, provides the best way to resolve all these issues, and to provide certainty as we negotiate and put in place the deep, ambitious agreement which will provide the foundations for our future relationship.</p></reply>

We face the possibility of a new arms race; the development of new weapons that could lower the threshold for use of nuclear weapons; and modernisation programmes that take us further away from the promise of nuclear disarmament enshrined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p>  <p>  In particular, the announcements by the United States and the Russian Federation that they are suspending their obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty are deeply worrying. Throughout its 30-year history, the INF has resulted in the removal and verifiable destruction of almost three thousand missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads.  As Secretary-General Guterres noted in his address to the Conference on Disarmament, &ldquo;we must take great care to preserve our existing frameworks&rdquo;. Ireland has consistently called for the US and Russia to address their concerns within the parameters of the Treaty, and I hope that every effort will be made to preserve the Treaty in the time remaining. </p>  <p>  Recent challenges to the INF Treaty have also raised concerns for other disarmament and non-proliferation instruments, including the negotiations on NEW START. Ireland strongly supports early negotiations on the extension of this important arms control mechanism. </p>  <p>  I support UN Secretary-General Guterres&rsquo; efforts to restore disarmament to its central role in building international peace and security.  In my address to the Conference on Disarmament in February this year, I announced that Ireland will champion the implementation of three key actions of the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Agenda for Disarmament: including the action on facilitating dialogue for nuclear disarmament. </p>  <p>  My Department has regular, constructive contacts with the US Administration both through our Embassy and Mission network in the US and through the US Embassy here in Dublin.  As part of regular Government engagement in the US, the Taoiseach travelled to Washington DC for the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day programme, which included a range of engagements with the US Administration and other political leaders.  While those meetings, and all contacts at Ministerial and official level, cover a range of issues of on-going mutual interest, as well as foreign policy issues, disarmament issues were not discussed on this occasion.</p></reply>

This number also facilitates a wide range of skills, abilities and experiences and allows for an appropriate level of rotation within the roster. A significant volume of work is involved in managing a 5-year relationship with 200 different individuals and, subject to individual mission needs, in ensuring that each roster member has an equal opportunity to be nominated for overseas missions.

The Government will continue to engage in support of that, consistent with our role and responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

The demonstrations, triggered by spiralling costs of living, began in the city of Atbara in the north east of the country on 19 December last year, quickly spreading to other towns and cities across the country. While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they soon developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.</p>  <p>  In reaction to the protests, schools have been closed in some areas and a national state of emergency was declared on 22 February, initially for a period of one year but later reduced to six months. Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds and  it is reported that over 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began and that more than 50 have been killed. The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the 28 February 2019 statement by the EU High Representative expressing concern at the situation in Sudan which underlined the importance of an environment for political dialogue and the exercise of the legitimate right to express differing views. Such an environment is essential to build national consensus on sustainable responses to Sudan's deep political and economic crisis.   Ireland also fully supports the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Sudanese Director of Public Prosecutions, tasked with the investigation of abuses. </p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change. These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children. Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012.</p></reply>

As part of these efforts, the Government has organised &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public information events around Ireland to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place.</p><p>These events brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments &ndash; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses.</p><p>The events also attracted significant domestic and international media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit.</p><p>The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in question took place in Cork on 5 October 2018, Galway on 12 October 2018, Monaghan on 19 October 2018, Dublin on 25 October, Limerick on 23 November 2018 and Letterkenny on 30 November 2018. </p><p>The positive impact of the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events and the Government's ongoing public information activities in relation to Brexit preparedness is reflected in an increase in the uptake of the many Brexit Business supports that are offered by State Agencies. For example, over 4,000 companies have availed of the Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard facility as a first step in developing their Brexit plan. Similarly, over 1,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service so far in 2019; this is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.</p><p>Other Brexit preparedness-related public information activities and events continue to be organised by Government Departments and State Agencies across Ireland. Since September 2018 there have been over 90 such events across 21 counties. Relevant details on these activities and events and on Brexit preparedness more generally can be found via the gov.ie/brexit website.</p><p>To coincide with the &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; events held to date, there was also a sustained public information campaign which ran on radio, in print media, online and via social media channels.  This campaign ensured that citizens and businesses were informed of the measures available to them.</p><p>In organising each event, every effort was made to ensure that costs were kept to the necessary minimum and that they achieved the best value for money. Costs that have arisen directly in connection with the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events held so far and costs for the accompanying public information campaign activities for which invoices/confirmed costings have been received are as follows:<table><tr><th>Item </th><th>Totals </th></tr><tr><td>Venue Hire, Catering &amp;amp; Related</td><td>&euro;69,242.84 </td></tr><tr><td>Event Staging / Audio-Visual Equipment (OPW)</td><td>&euro;101,595.73 </td></tr><tr><td>Event Materials / Signage / Badging</td><td>&euro;22,964.30 </td></tr><tr><td>Photography / Video / Podcast</td><td>&euro;17,252.85 </td></tr><tr><td>Advertising &amp;amp; Design</td><td>&euro;294,859.18 </td></tr><tr><td>Other </td><td>&euro;2,086.47 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>&euro;508,001.37 </td></tr></table></p><p>Regarding the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I understand that officials in my Department have been in direct contact with the Deputy&rsquo;s office to clarify the scope of this question, and that the Deputy will submit questions to a number of Departments on the specific information being sought.</p></reply>

At current projections it could mean tripling our current contributions. In order to achieve this ambition difficult choices will be required between competing priorities, especially if economic circumstances change, and this will require ongoing careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders will be needed if a steady, phased and prudent approach is to be achieved.</p><p>Based on current projections for economic growth, which may change as circumstances evolve, achieving the 0.7% target by 2030 would mean more than tripling the current allocations to ODA, and would require sustained, substantial managed increments given that the point of departure is 0.3% of GNI this year.  The Government is already making progress, having increased allocations to official development assistance by 32% since 2014. Budget 2019 saw the highest increase in funding available in over a decade, with Irish official development assistance in 2019 is forecast to reach almost &euro;817 million, an increase of approximately &euro;110 million and a 16% increase on the allocation announced in budget 2018.</p><p>The table sets out indicative allocations to ODA, based on current economic growth forecasts, which show a possible phased path to reaching the 0.7% target by 2030.  Allocations will of course be made annually as part of the normal budgetary process.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>ODA level <br /><br />&euro; Million </th><th>Expected ODA/GNI % Target</th></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>817 </td><td>0.30% </td></tr><tr><td>2023 </td><td>1400 </td><td>0.50% </td></tr><tr><td>2025 </td><td>1800 </td><td>0.57% </td></tr><tr><td>2027 </td><td>2100 </td><td>0.62% </td></tr><tr><td>2030 </td><td>2500 </td><td>0.70% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, unlike other excisable goods, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I believe the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p><p>In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such latter costs ultimately being borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p><p>In the course of last year's Finance Bill process, I acknowledged that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. At the time I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p><p>Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters in their pricing decisions.</p></reply>

Based on the borrower&rsquo;s income and expenses and other necessary and relevant financial and economic circumstances, the lender is then obliged to carry out an assessment of the credit worthiness of the borrower and the lender may only make credit available to the borrower where it considers that the borrower is likely to meet the obligations of the loan in the manner required under the loan agreement. However, subject to compliance with these and the other applicable regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgage credit to consumers, it remains a commercial matter for each lender to formulate its own overall credit policies and to make its own decisions on individual loan applications. </p>  <p>  In this context, I am advised by the Central Bank that each institution has its own credit policies and risk appetite for lending, and accordingly the specific categories of income which can be included/excluded when considering a mortgage application will vary from institution to institution. However, these are matters for each individual lender and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland have a role in such commercial policy decisions made by lenders.</p></reply>

At Budget time, it was estimated that, adjusting for the impact of the cycle, the structural budget balance would be broadly in line with the achievement of the medium-term objective (MTO) in 2019.</p><p>Last month, research was published under the joint Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners and ESRI Research Programme, titled &lsquo;Ireland and Brexit: Modelling the Impact of Deal and No-Deal Scenarios&rsquo;. This highlighted a number of Brexit scenarios and ranges for the impact on the General Government Balance (GGB). Under the &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; medium run scenario, the report pointed to a deterioration of 0.4 per cent of GDP in the GGB.

The European Commission sets minimum MTOs for each Member State every three years taking account of new information including changes in projected ageing costs. Member States subsequently set their own MTOs, respecting or complying with the Commission&rsquo;s &lsquo;minimum&rsquo; anchor. Ireland's current minimum MTO of a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP covers the period from 2017 to 2019. The Commission are currently working to produce updated minimum MTOs for the period covering the 2020-2022 budgetary cycle.  However, as part of our obligations through the Fiscal Compact Treaty, the lower limit of the MTO is set at a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP. In line with the above, Ireland&rsquo;s MTO for 2020 and beyond will be set out in the forthcoming 2019 Stability Programme Update.</p></reply>

These figures are reproduced in the table.</p><p>My officials are in the process of preparing the<i>Stability Programme Update 2019 (SPU)</i>, which will update these projections taking into account the most up-to-date information.</p><p>Projections beyond 2023 have not been compiled by my Department.<table><tr><th>- </th><th><b>2019</b></th><th><b>2020</b></th><th><b>2021</b></th><th><b>2022</b></th><th><b>2023</b></th></tr><tr><td>general government revenue, &euro; million</td><td>85,235</td><td>88,900</td><td>92,600</td><td>96,645</td><td>100,675</td></tr><tr><td>general government expenditure, &euro; million</td><td>85,310</td><td>87,840</td><td>90,985</td><td>92,480</td><td>94,865</td></tr><tr><td>one-off/temporary measures, &euro; million</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>general government revenue, per cent of GDP</td><td>25.0</td><td>24.7</td><td>24.6</td><td>24.6</td><td>24.6</td></tr><tr><td>general government expenditure, per cent of GDP</td><td>25.0</td><td>24.4</td><td>24.2</td><td>23.6</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>one-off/temporary measures, per cent of GDP</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr></table></p><p>The economic and budgetary outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty at present, given the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union.  In this regard, my Department has published several pieces of analysis in order to inform Government of the likely macroeconomic and fiscal consequences, and these are available on my Department's website.</p><p>The analysis published last week in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) shows the impact of a number of scenarios (from orderly to disorderly exit) taking into account a wider set of channels (including tariffs, non-tariff barriers, FDI impact).</p><p>In a disorderly, no-deal scenario, the level of economic activity in Ireland after a decade would be around 5 percentage points below a hypothetical scenario in which the UK did not leave the EU.  The general government balance would be 1 percentage point worse.  These budgetary data are available on a headline basis only; a breakdown between general government revenue and expenditure is not available.</p><p>The model used to generate these forecasts is a medium-term structural model of the Irish economy.  These structural models are designed <i>inter alia</i>to simulate shocks to the economy but, as is normally the case, the impact is assessed over the medium-term.  These models are generally less-suited to short-term diagnostics.  This requires an element of judgement and, on this basis, my Department will publish economic forecasts over the 2019-2023 period under different scenarios in the forthcoming SPU.</p><p>As I have said previously, budgetary policy will be based on doing what is right for the economy and not on the basis of ill-fitting fiscal rules.  In this regard, I would direct the Deputy to the Parliamentary Budget Office whose role is to assist the <i>Oireachtas</i>in these matters.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that there are several inputs to calculate the so-called structural balance, with many moving parts.  Revised numbers will be set out in the SPU.  I would stress once again, however, that minimum compliance with the fiscal rules is not an appropriate policy at this stage of the economic cycle.</p></reply>

The potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that, as of 2 January 2019, the cost to the Exchequer of the HRI was c. &euro;105 million, with a further &euro;65 million worth of credits yet to be claimed in respect of the incentive. As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base. </p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, data on the exact numbers of play centres closing is not collected by my Department nor the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that the main reason for the difficulties being faced by the play centre sector is due to a lack of capacity in the insurance market, which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in the sector.  In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore, part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover in the first place will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.</p>  <p>  In a recent meeting with Insurance Ireland, I understand that Minister of State D'Arcy, who has responsibility for Insurance within my Department, raised the issue of the difficulties play centres currently face in securing insurance.  In response, Insurance Ireland highlighted the problems that Irish insurers encountered in this sector regarding claims and specifically the high amounts being paid out.  Having said that, Insurance Ireland agreed to relay Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy&rsquo;s concerns to its members taking into account some of the implemented and proposed Cost of Insurance Working Group reforms, including the proposal to implement the recommendations of the second Personal Injuries Commission Report.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, has undertaken a detailed examination of the factors contributing to the cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.</p>  <p>  The CIWG has produced two reports and eight quarterly progress updates on the various recommendations made by CIWG and endorsed by Government.  The difficulties facing the consumer, voluntary and small business sector from the high cost of insurance premiums are recognised.  In addition, it is also acknowledged that in some cases the survival of a business as a viable entity is being put at peril because of insurance pricing.  One of the key areas raised by various stakeholders to the CIWG is the level of awards in this country compared with elsewhere.  As a result, the Working Group established the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and commissioned it to examine this issue amongst other things.  The PIC reported in September 2018 and concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in the UK and other jurisdictions and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council.  The PIC recommended that this body would become responsible for preparing the guidelines on personal injury award levels, and would replace the Book of Quantum.  In doing this, the PIC believes that the Judicial Council will, in compiling the guidelines, take account of the jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal and the results of its benchmarking exercise.</p>  <p>  The current position with the Judicial Council Bill is that the Minister for Justice and Equality has recently advised of his intention to further this Bill with a view to having it in place as soon as possible.  I understand the Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the Seanad next Tuesday. Alongside this, the Law Reform Commission has included the subject of capping damages in personal injuries litigation in its 5th Programme of Law Reform and this project is being given immediate attention.  It is hoped that if there was a significant move in this area, it could have an impact on insurance pricing and could also help attract new entrants into the market.  Such outcomes would be of benefit to all concerned and in particular to small businesses such as those in play centre sector.</p></reply>

The ESRI is building upon its work in this regard by developing a multi annual model to better inform our decision making into the future. The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action published last week recommended that the Government should consider the impacts on low-income families of any future increases in Carbon Taxes and introduce specific policy measures to assist those who may not be in a position to immediately transition from fossil fuels. It is my intention to use the work of the ESRI, the Oireachtas Committee and the Climate Change Advisory Council to develop proposals for Budget 2020.</p></reply>

Further to this process, Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI) was awarded a 20 year licence in February 2014, which raised &euro;405 m for use by job rich projects such as the Wild Atlantic Way and the National Sports Campus.</p><p>The National Lottery Act 2013 was passed to provide new governing arrangements for the National Lottery, which included the establishment of a National Lottery Regulator.</p><p>The functions of the Regulator are described in the Act, and include the following:</p><p>- To procure the holding of the National Lottery.</p><p>- To monitor the operation of the National Lottery and to monitor and enforce compliance with the Act and the Licence to operate the National Lottery.</p><p>- To consider for approval certain matters relating to the National Lottery (including schemes for National Lottery games).</p><p>- Manage and control the National Lottery Fund.</p><p>The regulator must exercise these functions with the objectives of ensuring the probity and long-term sustainability of the National Lottery, that the interests of participants are protected, and, subject to those objectives being met, maximise returns for good causes.</p><p>The Regulator monitors the activities of the Operator in accordance with her statutory objectives and in order to ensure compliance with the Act and Licence. The 118 page Licence to operate the National Lottery covers a very wide range of aspects which relate to the operation and regulation of the National Lottery including: payments to the National Lottery Fund, testing of draw equipment, use of trademarks, and the Operator's obligations at the end of the Licence period.</p><p>There are also four Codes of Practice in place, including a Sales Code of Practice, a Participants' Code of Practice, an Advertising and Promotion Code of Practice and a Vetting Procedures Code of Practice. Further detail regarding these Codes, and the National Lottery Licence (subject to a small number of redactions) is available on the Office of the National Lottery Regulator's website (<i>www.rnl.ie</i>).</p><p>The elements of the Licence and its Codes that apply to the regulation of the sale of National Lottery products include rules in relation to:</p><p>- The content of advertising and promotion of National Lottery games.</p><p>- Responsible gaming.</p><p>- Seeking approval for new games or amendments to existing games.</p><p>- Prohibited games.</p><p>- Registration for interactive channels.</p><p>- Preventing the sale of National Lottery games to minors.</p><p>- Standards to be observed by Retailers and their staff or employees.</p><p>- Monitoring of retailers.</p><p>While this type of regulation is in place to monitor and ensure compliance with the National Lottery Act 2013, the licence to operate the National Lottery and to manage and control the National Lottery Fund, Minister of State with special responsibility for gambling regulation, David Stanton TD, recently announced that the Government has approved plans to establish an Irish gambling regulatory authority.</p><p>This decision is part of two initiatives agreed at cabinet in relation to the future regulation of gambling in Ireland. The Department of Justice and Equality will now draft the necessary heads of legislation. In parallel, work will be advanced on scoping the resources needed to establish an effective regulatory regime.</p></reply>

These estimates are informed by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) paper &lsquo;Budgetary Impacts of Changing Demographics 2017 &ndash; 2027&rsquo;. These are included in multi-annual Ministerial expenditure ceilings for Health, Social Protection and Education. Beyond 2022, the IGEES paper suggests demographic costs of approximately &euro;0.4 billion per year, however these figures will be subject to review in the near future. Amounts are also included for public service pay agreements in table 6, on page 42 of Expenditure Report 2019. These resources are included on an aggregate basis and are to be allocated to the relevant Ministerial Vote groups as part of the annual Estimates process.</p><p>An amount of &euro;0.4 billion is included for the Public Service Stability Agreement for 2020 and &euro;0.3 billion for 2021.  Table 7, on page 43 of Expenditure Report 2019 sets out the carryover impact of certain current expenditure measures announced as part of Budget 2019, amounting to &euro;0.3 billion. As these estimates relate to measures being implemented in 2019, they will be impacted by the actual cost and timing of implementation and consequently the estimated costs will be reassessed during 2019 and set out in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, these costs would need to be met from the remaining unallocated resources in the absence of any re-prioritisation of expenditure identified during the Estimates process, informed by the Spending Review. These costs, as included in the Expenditure Report 2019, for the period out to 2021 are set out in the following table.</p><p>Pre-committed Gross Voted Current Expenditure 2020 - 2021<table><tr><th>-</th><th>2020</th><th>2021</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;bn</td><td>&euro;bn</td></tr><tr><td>Demographics</td><td>451</td><td>454</td></tr><tr><td>Pay Agreements</td><td>390</td><td>261</td></tr><tr><td>Carryover of Budget 2019 Decisions</td><td>311</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total Current</td><td>1,152</td><td>715</td></tr></table></p><p>Planned capital investment levels out to 2027 have been set out under the National Development Plan, allowing for long-term planning of infrastructural investment in Ireland.

I expect that it will be necessary to make some moderate adjustments to the published allocations over the period, however, I believe that any amendments will be modest and will not pose any material effect on Departmental allocations. Thus, NDP gives a very clear signal of Government's long term capital spending plans.</p>  <p>  While my Department sets the capital allocations for Departments and the delegated sanction arrangements under which Departments make their spending decisions, the actual roll-out of particular capital projects and programmes is, of course, managed by the individual line Departments and their agencies who are responsible for project and programme delivery.</p>  <p>  As the NDP states, each Government Department is responsible for ensuring that its proposed projects meet with appropriate regulatory requirements including those related to planning law and environmental impact assessments. Departments must also ensure that individual projects and investment proposals meet all of the relevant appraisal processes and value-for-money tests required under the Public Spending Code, before Exchequer resources are ultimately expended on the relevant projects. Individual Departments also have the obligation to manage any multi-annual contractual commitments within the terms of their sanction.</p></reply>

However, General Council Report No. 1324, adopted in December 1997, extended the period of payment for children in full time education up to age 22. This was on foot of a claim lodged by the staff side on the basis that 3rd level education and training was then the norm rather than the exception, and that in many cases children were still in full-time education at age 21.</p><p>While agreeing to the increase from age 21 to 22, the Official side noted that public service schemes, as a whole, offered terms that were more favourable than those available in the private sector. That view was generally supported by the Commission on Public Service Pensions in its final report (2000), which found that all public service schemes include spouses&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s benefits, whereas this was not necessarily the case in the private sector. The Commission did not recommend any further extension in the upper age limits for payment of children's pensions.</p><p>In relation to the numbers of children accessing the scheme, I have been informed by Payroll Shared Service Centre, which administers the civil service scheme, that these are as follows:<table><tr><th>Age group</th><th>No. Accessing the Scheme. </th></tr><tr><td>Aged under 16</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 16</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 17</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 18</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 19</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 20</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Aged 21</td><td>50</td></tr></table></p><p>As I have already noted, the granting of the pension up until the age of 22 is contingent on the child attending full-time education. 48 eligible recipients reached age 22 in 2018, and thus had their pensions ceased.</p><p>I have no plans to extend the payment of children&rsquo;s pension for those in full time education beyond the point of their 22nd birthday. However, I would bring to the Deputy's attention that in the case of permanent physical or mental incapacity, a child's pension may be continued for life if the incapacity occurred when the child was under 16, or under 22 while in full-time education or training.</p></reply>

For this approach to be sustainable, due consideration has to be given to the assurances of confidentiality, set down in legislation, to all those who gave testimony or engaged with the bodies in any way based on the assurance of confidentiality, balanced with the wider public interest of retaining the records for posterity and eventually opening them to public inspection.  The provisions of the Bill in regard to a lengthy retention period reflect the need to strike that balance.</p></reply>

Under these regulations there are four defined routes to registration, namely Route 1 Primary; Route 2 Post-Primary; Route 3 Further Education; Route 4 Other. </p><p>My Department has no plans to amend the Teaching Council's (Registration) Regulations 2016 to include a special education teacher category.</p><p>Under Section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes are subject to review and accreditation by the Teaching Council, in accordance with the Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017). In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE. Inclusive education encompasses education of children with special educational needs, including autism. </p><p>The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes. </p><p>The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020. </p><p>Schools should endeavour to assign experienced teachers to Special Classes with appropriate qualifications and, wherever possible, a background in working with students with special educational needs. Schools should also be proactive in meeting the continuing professional development needs of their special class teachers, in addition to developing and reviewing their whole school polices in relation to the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs.</p><p>A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2 (NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular as between student placement and the university experience. These findings will be considered by the Teaching Council in the course of its work.</p><p>The NCSE Support Service delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support for teachers working with students with special educational needs in special classes. Schools planning to open special class provision should contact the NCSE Support Service as soon as they receive their letter of sanction in order to facilitate planning for training of teachers. The NCSE Support Service can be contacted at: <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>In addition to the above, the Department provides funding support for teachers to expand their capacity through courses at the Middletown Centre for Autism and through funded post-graduate provision at a number of higher education institutions for teachers involved in Learning Support &amp;amp; Special Education.</p></reply>

The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports including additional teaching posts, Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to Continuing Professional Development and the School Excellence Fund for DEIS. Up until 2011 Traveller pupils attending a DEIS school, but who were supported by an Resource Teacher for Travellers (RTT), were not counted as part of the valid enrolment for the implementation of the enhanced pupil teacher ratios. When the Traveller pupils were no longer supported by RTTs, the compensatory measure proposed for DEIS schools was to apply the DEIS Band 1 pupil teacher ratios to include Traveller pupils, for the purposes of determining the level of mainstream teaching staff in the relevant DEIS schools. There were 81 alleviation posts as a result.</p>  <p>  - New Model for allocating special education teaching resources to schools which includes a baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention.</p>  <p>  - Since the end of 2018 there were 15,000 Special Needs Assistants directly supporting 34,670 children and Budget 2019 made provision for an additional 950 SNA posts, which will bring the total allowable Whole Time Equivalent SNA posts at 31 December 2019 to 15,950.</p>  <p>  - National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) who work with both primary</p>  <p>  - and post-primary schools and are concerned with learning, behaviour, social and</p>  <p>  - emotional development. Since 2011, sanctioned NEPS psychologist numbers have grown from 173 Whole time equivalents (WTE) to 194 WTEs with a further 10 psychologist posts provided for under Budget 2019 for the 2019/20 school year. Currently NEPS psychologist numbers stand at 183 Whole Time Equivalent staff. </p>  <p>  In addition all children including traveller children are supported by the integrated Educational Welfare Service of Tusla. The Department of Education and Skills works closely with TUSLA Educational and Welfare service in relation to attendance in schools.</p>  <p>  Over and above the supports outlined above provided within the mainstream system, a number of Traveller-specific supports remain in place within the education system:-</p>  <p>  - In  addition to the 81 posts allocated to DEIS schools following the inclusion of Traveller pupils as outlined above, 60 posts were allocated as alleviation posts to other schools with a large number of Traveller pupils supported by what were previously Resource Teachers for Travellers. </p>  <p>  - Enhanced primary level pupil capitation for Traveller pupils at a rate of &euro;70 per pupil at a cost of &euro;547,960 in 2018.</p>  <p>  - Enhanced post-primary level pupil capitation for Traveller pupils at a rate of &euro;201 per pupil at a cost of &euro;585,714 in 2018. </p>  <p>  - My Department is also one of the key partners in a cross-departmental Pilot initiative being developed under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, to support Traveller and Roma attendance, participation and retention. Additional supports have been provided to support this pilot project in the form of Home School Community Liaison Officers funded by my Department, in addition to Traveller Education Workers funded by the Department of Justice and Equality and Educational Welfare Officers employed by TUSLA.</p></reply>

The Teaching Council&rsquo;s Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers (published in 2011 and revised in March 2017) is an important document that must be observed by all providers of initial teacher education in order that their programmes are recognised for the purposes of teacher registration. These Criteria and Guidelines state that inclusive education (including Multiculturalism, Disadvantage and Special Education) is a mandatory area of study for all student teachers who are undertaking programmes of initial teacher education at primary and post primary levels in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Criteria and Guidelines also set out learning outcomes for graduates of programmes of initial teacher education. The graduate teacher is also required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the factors that promote and hinder learning, the impact of pupils&rsquo; backgrounds and identities on learning and the need to provide for the holistic development of the learner, particularly through differentiated approaches. A further learning outcome for the graduate teacher is to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of cross-curricular links and themes including citizenship; creativity; inclusion and diversity; as appropriate to the sector and stage of education, and how these are related to life experiences.</p>  <p>   The Teaching Council is currently reviewing the impact of the current programmes of initial teacher education, through a comprehensive consultation process, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation in 2020. </p>  <p>  Across the state-funded Higher Education Institutions, there are also projects that would help prepare teachers to combat racism and xenophobia, through fostering global citizenship and intercultural education.   </p>  <p>  While continuing professional development is not compulsory, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provide access to support for teachers in anti-bullying which cover topics related to anti-racism as part of the SPHE curriculum.   Contextualised school support  in this area of SPHE is also available from PDST on application.</p></reply>

These initiatives include mentoring and peer support measures. Funding of &euro;2.5 million per annum is available for PATH Strand 3 for three years. </p><p>PATH Strand 2 provides &euro;6m to be invested in &ldquo;The 1916 Bursaries Fund&rdquo; over three years for the most socio economically disadvantaged students from under-represented target groups including Travellers.  A steering group of the National Access Plan was set up to monitor progress and provide advice on specific aspects of the Plan.  Pavee Point is represented on this group.</p><p>A PATH seminar was held in November 2018 and this included  representatives from the Traveller Groups.

The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s team of locally based Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise parents whose children have special needs and identify available placements. They also support and advise schools in this area. Parents who are experiencing difficulties in locating a special class placement, should contact their local SENO. </p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned. In this regard, the SENO may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability. </p>  <p>  When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.</p>  <p>  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required. In those circumstances, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. This process is ongoing and the NCSE are actively engaging with schools in Cork in relation to establishing ASD classes where there is an identified need for the 2019/2020 school year.</p>  <p>  160 new special classes have been opened for the 2018/19 school year, which means there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. </p>  <p>  There are currently 246 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Cork City and County. Of these, 28 are ASD early intervention classes, 119 are primary ASD classes and 54 are post primary ASD classes. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This new model involves a  calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school,  based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is based on the geographical CSO Small Areas where  the pupil cohort resides. A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</p>  <p>  Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools, including 66 primary schools, were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 primary schools being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.   </p>  <p>  DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p>  <p>  Further analysis is currently being undertaken to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  An analysis is also underway on the quality of the address data of individual schools.  Until the further analysis is complete, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools.</p></reply>

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  A number of sections in my Department share information with DEASP such as the Forward Planning Section (Child Benefit data is utilised for demographic analysis/requirement for new schools) and Statistics Section (Single Customer View is utilised to verify PPS numbers for the Primary Online Database (POD).</p>  <p>  Child Benefit data is one of the sources utilised in the nationwide demographic exercises and provides comprehensive information on numbers and locations of children for school planning purposes. The data is considered to be reliable and accurate at the time at which it is provided and allows my Department to project likely demand across the 314 school planning areas. As the Deputy will appreciate, this data is subject to change for example where families relocate between the time the information is supplied and the following year's provision of updated Child Benefit data to my Department. </p>  <p>  The Child Benefit data from DEASP as a source of information for our nationwide demographic exercises is used in conjunction with other sources of data such as information from local authorities on additional residential development in each area. The requirement for new schools is being kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard to the impact of the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

There are 54 ETB schools who have enrolments in excess of 700 pupils. Of these 32 ETB schools will see their administrative supports increase to 2 WTEs - the remaining schools already have a minimum of 2 WTEs. These schools also have funding for 1 WTE Caretaking post.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that while my Department allocates non-teaching staffing supports in accordance with the criteria outlined above, it is a matter for each ETB to decide where they allocate these supports according to the needs of their organization.</p>  <p>  When allocating non-teaching staff to ETBs in respect of their schools, my Department is guided by the following criteria: Schools with enrolments of 249 or less pupils are allocated a 0.5 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) Administrative and Caretaking posts; </p>  <p>  - Schools with enrolments of between 250 and 699 pupils are allocated a 1 WTE Administrative and Caretaking posts; </p>  <p>  - Schools with enrolments of 250 or more are allocated 1 WTE caretaking post and  </p>  <p>  - In respect of Cleaning supports, each school is allocated 4.5 hours per annum per pupil up to a maximum of 2028 hours per annum, with a minimum allocation of 520 hours per annum</p>  <p>  Overall I acknowledge the need to improve non-teaching supports to the education sector including for ETBs but I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures and prioritise where it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. </p></reply>

Following the passing of a resolution in the D&aacute;il, the instrument of ratification was deposited with the UN on the 20th of March 2018 and the Convention came into force for Ireland on the 19th of April 2018.  </p>  <p>  The Convention and the Optional Protocol cover a broad range of commitments some of which require substantive cultural change such as those relating to de-congregation, personalised budgets and deprivation of liberty.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the Convention is one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.  Accordingly, the Optional Protocol is not being ratified at this time but will be ratified at the earliest opportunity following completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle, which will identify any additional actions needed to ensure the highest possible level of compliance with the Convention.</p></reply>

This information is accessible and available on the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government website.</p><p>RIA has recently revised its policy in relation to canvassing and political activity in accommodation centres.  This is in line with actions in the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2020 which focus on efforts to ensure that the political system becomes more representative of the broader population.  </p><p>In the 30 day period leading up to a referendum or election (local, national or European) in which residents may be eligible to vote, canvassers and political representatives may leave material for display in a designated area, e.g. on the public notice board/tables in the accommodation centre for the information of residents.</p><p>Canvassers and candidates may arrange to meet by appointment with residents in communal spaces, in keeping with the agreed procedures for visitors to centres as outlined in &lsquo;RIA House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures - Revised January 2019&rsquo;.  Centre managers should put measures in place to facilitate such visits.</p><p>In instances where a centre is comprised of individual accommodation units and includes mobile homes, houses and self-catering apartments, candidates and canvassers may be facilitated where they wish to call &lsquo;door to door&rsquo;.  However, there is no requirement on the part of a resident to engage with any candidate unless they choose to do so.</p><p>Centres should display notices in prominent locations throughout the accommodation centre within the 30 day period leading up to a referendum or local election indicating that:-<ol type="1"><li>A referendum/local elections is being held with the polling date specified;</li><li>Residents in accommodation centres with the right to vote in local elections may be approached by candidates and/or canvassers on their behalf;</li><li>They are not required to engage with any candidate and/or canvasser;</li><li>It is the responsibility of each resident to ensure that they are registered to vote within an appropriate time frame. </li></ol>Given the particular nature of the accommodation provided in centres, there are factors that limit unrestricted access by candidates to the private living quarters of residents.  These include the communal nature of the accommodation system and the many practical and logistical difficulties that would arise for centre managers in providing unsupervised access in circumstances where families and children live together.  </p><p>The general policy ensures that there are no restrictions placed on residents&rsquo; voting rights, or on their rights to access whatever information that candidates wish to convey to them, or on any rights to meet with candidates in the public areas of centres.  It also ensures privacy in the residential units and the on-going protection of children in the centre.</p><p>There is an opportunity for the Friends of the Centre group at each centre to provide information to residents on how to register to vote and on the importance of local government within the political structure of the State.  The Friends of the Centre groups can also raise awareness in an informal way about the importance of voting.</p><p>The revised policy has been circulated to all accommodation centres and the policy is available on the RIA's website <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

I am further informed that the nature of communication and coordination in a search for a missing person, or persons, will be dictated by prevailing circumstances. </p><p>On receipt of notification of a person being missing it is necessary for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish:<ol type="1"><li>the need for a search;</li><li>the purpose to be achieved by a search; and</li><li>the extent of search, if required.</li></ol>In making decisions regarding action to be taken, careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including:  </p><p>-  any factors which may render the missing person as particularly vulnerable, e.g. dementia, depression, age; </p><p>- the environment in which the search is to be conducted, i.e. urban, rural, mountainous, water-based; </p><p>- any previous missing person-related event associated with the person in question; </p><p>- the level of resources available to launch a quick and effective search operation; and </p><p>- the appropriate resources/assets to be used in the search, including whether specialist personnel and/or equipment is required.</p><p>These factors will be influential in determining the method of the search to be used. </p><p>The planning process involves consideration of all relevant evidence, information and intelligence, for the purpose of determining the nature of search operation to be undertaken.  Typically, a family liaison officer (FLO) will be appointed and may play a crucial role in ensuring relevant information from family members is considered when deciding on an appropriate search plan.</p><p>Properly planned searches are a central factor in achieving the best possible outcome, in circumstances where one or more person is missing.  It is, therefore important that a formal planning process is applied to all searches, irrespective of the extent of search required.</p><p>The Garda Superintendent (District Officer) of the location from which a person is missing will have particular responsibility to ensure that any search undertaken is done in a lawful and appropriate manner, and involves utilisation of necessary resources and techniques.  The potential impact of a search on a community will also be considered, which will help in developing an appropriate communication strategy.  When planning a search, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with other relevant State agencies and with civilian volunteer groups, such as mountain rescue teams or diving clubs.</p><p>Through the facility of the Garda Press Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also engage in an appropriate media strategy, designed to ensure that cooperation from the general public is achieved in a manner that maximizes the potential to locate a missing person as soon as is possible.</p></reply>

It has met 11 times.  A smaller more focused group, that is the NTRIS Pilot Oversight Group, has also been established to work on a pilot project to trial a new approach to address the retention of Traveller and Roma children in education.  They have met on six occasions.</p>  <p>  The Mediation/Feuding Subgroup is comprised of the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives of the Traveller organisations.  The subgroup is implementing Action 138 to bring an end to feuding definitively over a period of time.

In order to remove a skill from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case would then need to be put forward by the Department of Health as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration.</p>  <p>  A review of the occupation lists is being currently being finalised at present with some 48 submission made in response to the public/stakeholder consultation.  Another review of the occupation lists is scheduled to commence before the end of quarter two, 2019.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.654.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200064#WRN01600"><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory independent body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU competition law in the State.  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Commission is independent in the performance of its functions.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Commission, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has no direct function in the matter.</p><p>The following table details the relevant information regarding the fines imposed on undertakings and individuals arising from cases investigated by the CCPC.  It is important to note that, with the exception of Fixed Payment Notices, fines following a summary prosecution are imposed by the Courts and payments are made to the relevant District Court Office and not to the CCPC.  Fines imposed in criminal proceedings are the responsibility of the courts.  The CCPC itself collects Fixed Payment Notices from relevant traders.</p><p>- Criminal breaches of competition law - the CCPC&rsquo;s role is to investigate alleged cartels and if sufficient evidence of a cartel is obtained, the CCPC role involves the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) with a recommendation as to prosecution.  It is the DPP that initiates the court prosecution and not the CCPC.  </p><p>- Civil breaches of competition law - the objective of a non-criminal law investigation is to determine if there is sufficient evidence of a breach and to take appropriate actions.  Civil breaches of competition law are enforced through the civil courts and have to be proven on a balance of probabilities.  With respect to these breaches the most the CCPC can achieve through the Courts at present is to: (i) seek a declaration of an infringement; (ii) seek commitments from a business that they will cease the practice; and/or (iii) obtain an injunction against the business doing the same action again.  Financial sanctions cannot be imposed.  </p><p>- Consumer protection law - A criminal prosecution for a trader who has broken the law is the ultimate enforcement sanction available to the CCPC.  The level of fines and penalties following a successful prosecution are set out in the various consumer protection statutes and are imposed by the courts. - Compensation orders - can be imposed instead of or in addition to fines.  If the compensation order is not paid then the consumer may enter judgement in the court and is enforceable in the same manner as civil proceedings.  The CCPC does not enforce the payment of compensation orders. </p><p>- Fixed Payment Notice - The Consumer Protection Act enables the CCPC to issue a fixed payment notice (FPNs) in respect of contraventions of primarily price display legislation. FPNs can also issue for breaches of law giving effect to the Consumer Rights Directive.  This sanction may be used as an alternative to prosecution.  The penalty is &euro;300 and must be paid within 28 days.  Failure to pay will result in prosecution. </p><p>- Note - the CCPC&rsquo;s 2018 Consumer Protection List (which details all enforcement action under consumer protection law for the year) is currently being finalised and therefore not included in the excel spreadsheet. </p><p>CCPC Prosecutions<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Business Practice </th><th>Against </th><th>Outcome </th><th>Sentence </th><th>Total value </th><th>Paid </th><th>Additional Information </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Consumer Protection law - Misleading Commercial Practice </td><td>Timmy Keane</td><td>Convicted</td><td>Fined &euro;500 &amp;amp;

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  An annual capitation payment of &euro;434.15 is payable in respect of each GMS patient over 70 years of age residing in a private nursing home approved by the HSE for periods in excess of 5 weeks. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to introduce a new contract specifically for the provision of general practitioner services to nursing homes.  However, the Deputy will be aware of the talks which are currently underway with GP representatives in relation to the reform of the current GMS contract.  The focus of these talks is on developing a range of modernisation, reform and sustainability measures and the development of a chronic disease management programme for GMS and GP visit card patients. </p>  <p>  Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform would provide substantial benefits for patients and facilitate a very significant increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multi-annual basis.</p></reply>

These reports are subsequently published by the HSE on a quarterly basis.

Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Government of Ireland. However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way.  </p>  <p>  To date in 2019, 17 new medicines and 3 new uses of existing medicines have been approved by the HSE (at an additional cost of approximately &euro;150m over five years).  </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2019 includes a provision of &euro;10m for new drugs enabled by an &ldquo;invest to save&rdquo; programme.  In accordance with the National Service Plan, the HSE is committed to the introduction of cost reduction measures to create the financial headroom, for new drugs in 2019.   To assist the HSE in creating this financial headroom, the National Service Plan 2019 includes a provision of &euro;3m for the establishment of a HSE dedicated pharmaceutical value improvement programme, to bring about greater efficiencies in medicines management and to promote changes in prescribing behaviour in favour of more clinically efficient and cost-effective products in both community and hospital settings. </p>  <p>  These new measures are expected to complement existing cost control initiatives which are being undertaken by the HSE under the auspices of the Medicines Management Programme. Among the initiatives already being pursued are improvement in practices for the procurement of drugs in hospitals and the designation of preferred products, with a focus on high cost prescribing areas. </p>  <p>  The HSE is also strengthening its pharmacy resourcing capacity in order to target particular areas, such as biosimilars. To date substantial progress has been achieved in increasingly biosimilar prescribing rates in acute hospitals. For example the prescribing rate for the biosimilar drug infliximab has increased from 5% in 2017 to 40% in 2018. The biosimilar drug rituximab became available in July 2017 and the dispensing rate has already increased to 25%. The HSE is working on identifying barriers to the prescribing of biosimilars with a specific focus on education and supports. It is seeking to increase understanding of biosimilars through targeted presentations to clinicians and hospitals. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health proposes to build on these positive developments and to bring forward a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy statement that would support and complement the many initiatives which are already underway.</p>  <p>  In spite of significant progress on drug costs achieved from reference pricing and the price reductions under the IPHA Agreement, the Health Service is still facing significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines &ndash; mainly related to the emergence of increasing numbers of very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area.  </p>  <p>  In that regard,  I and officials have been engaging over the past number of years, with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  Members of the Beneluxa Initiative will work closely together to identify pragmatic solutions to the challenges which we all now face with medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p></reply>

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is ongoing and the Joint Committee intends to report thereon before the summer recess. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, officials in my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, are developing a model of care for infertility and an associated public fund for AHR. This work includes developing proposals on the allocation for a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment during 2019 that was announced by the Taoiseach in December 2018.</p>  <p>  The development of a model of care for infertility will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. Once the funding proposals have been submitted and approved by Government, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund. As such no specific decision has been made at this time in relation to the parameters of any potential public funding model, including what eligibility criteria may be included.  </p>  <p>  While AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish Public Health Service there is some support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility i.e. Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>   The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents  with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs are being considered in detail. </p>  <p>  I understand that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and it is expected that the Steering Group will be provided with a final draft very shortly. Once complete the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly through the review process.</p></reply>

These have included low cost loan schemes to assist on-farm and agri business cost effectiveness, additional supports to Bord Bia and Teagasc to support market and product diversification, and, in Budget 2019, a &euro;78 million package to support farmers, fishermen and food SMEs.</p>  <p>  More recently, I have held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the economic impact of Brexit, including on the margins of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on 18 March. I have stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the impact on the sector, including through traditional EU market supports and exceptional aid provisions under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as through increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  Commissioner Hogan has confirmed that the EU is ready to respond positively, and my officials remain in regular contact with Commission officials in this regard.</p>  <p>  While ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement is still the Government's objective, practical preparations are also underway for a no-deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  On preparedness for import controls, we have been working with other departments and agencies to have the necessary arrangements in place at our ports and airports in order to allow the Department to fulfil its legal obligations as efficiently as possible, while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements. </p>  <p>  My Department has also sharpened its Brexit communications strategy, which now includes an enhanced Brexit page on the Department&rsquo;s website, the circulation of focused Trader Notices to the relevant sectors, the establishment of a Brexit Call Centre and central e-mail address, and increased use of social media.  I would urge operators in the sector to engage with these services as we continue our preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.</p></reply>

These measures are complemented by intensified trade missions and market access activity in order to increase the sector&rsquo;s global footprint across the world and reduce our exposure to the UK market.  </p>  <p>  I also recently met with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the sector, and stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors. The Commissoner confirmed the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and my Department&rsquo;s officials are continuing to explore potential options with their Commission counterparts in this regard.  </p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the agri-food sector is of critical importance to the Irish economy, and its regional spread means that it underpins the socio-economic development of rural Ireland in particular.</p>  <p>  My Department has conducted a range of analysis and research in relation to Brexit. This work is ongoing, and has been primarily concerned with the implications of Brexit for agri-food trade with the UK across different sectors.</p>  <p>  For example, both internally and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders through the Brexit Stakeholder Consultative Committee and the All-Island Civic Dialogue process, my Department has established the extent of sectoral exposure to the UK market, the potential implications of Brexit for each sector, and the potential practical impact on the day-to-day functioning of trade flows. </p>  <p>  The agencies reporting to my Department have also undertaken important research in relation to Brexit, with Teagasc publishing reports on, for example, the potential implications for the Irish agri-food sector in overall terms and on the implications for family farm incomes, and Bord Bia conducting important work through its Brexit Barometer. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department has contributed to analysis by a range of agencies and bodies including the ESRI, Copenhagen Economics and the Department of Finance, amongst others. </p>  <p>  These analyses have highlighted the exposure of the agri-food sector to the negative impacts of a 'no- deal' Brexit. Through Government support, I and my officials have introduced a series of budgetary and marketing measures aimed at mitigating the more severe impacts, and I am in regular contact with Commissioner Hogan in relation to securing additional support for the sector in the event of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit.</p></reply>

The Government published a Contingency Action Plan on 19 December, setting out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government has already introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit.  In terms of dealing with Competitiveness issues, my Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget.  In Budget 2018, I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to agri-food and seafood businesses. </p>  <p>  Our enterprise agencies are continuing to work with seafood companies to help them to deal with Brexit through making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. </p>  <p>  My priority has been, and remains, to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources.  However, in a worst case scenario of a disorderly departure we can expect that those reciprocal arrangements will  be impacted, at least in the very short term. </p>  <p>  In recent months, I have continued to have regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Coastal Member States whose fisheries are potentially most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, as well as the European Commission.   I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.  In recent weeks, the EU has adopted two legislative proposals to help mitigate the significant impact that a &ldquo;no-deal&rdquo; Brexit would have on Irish fisheries.</p>  <p>  The first proposal is to allow fishermen and operators from EU Members States to receive compensation under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. This would help off-set some of the impact of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU fishing vessels in a no-deal scenario. The exact details of how this would work in practice and the funding elements are still under discussion within the EU. Of course, it would be our hope that such measures would not be necessary.</p>  <p>  The second proposal amends the Regulation on the Sustainable Management of the External Fleets. The aim of this proposal is to ensure that the EU is in a position to grant UK vessels access to EU waters until the end of 2019, on the condition that EU vessels are also granted reciprocal access to UK waters. The proposal also provides for a simplified procedure to authorise UK vessels to fish in EU waters and EU vessels to fish in UK waters &ndash; should the UK grant that access. This proposal is limited to 2019 and is based on the agreement in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of 17 and 18 December 2018 on the fishing opportunities for 2019.</p>  <p>  A disorderly departure, that included a loss of access to UK waters, would have very serious consequence for our seafood industry.  I am satisfied that, in cooperation with our stakeholders and EU partners we are doing all that we can to plan to mitigate the potential impacts.   A disorderly Brexit will be about damage limitation not, unfortunately, damage elimination.</p></reply>

This is regardless of whether a tree or trees are on public or private property.  My Department also published the Felling and Reforestation Policy document in May 2017 to provide a consolidated source of information on the legal and regulatory framework relating to tree felling. </p>  <p>  Applications for felling licences may like other forestry-related operations, be subject to a screening process under the Environmental Impact Assessment and the Birds and Habitats Directives, to assess if the operations will have a significant impact on the environment and habitat.  If a significant effect is likely or where uncertainty exists, the Department must request a Natura Impact Assessment from the applicant and may carry out an Appropriate Assessment to gauge the nature of the impact and the effectiveness of any mitigation measures proposed to avoid adverse effects. </p>  <p>  Applications for felling licences are published on my Department's website which provides an opportunity for people to make a submission on the proposed felling within a 30 day period.  Where a felling licence has issued, a 28 day time limit for the receipt of appeals applies in all cases.  A site notice must also be displayed at the entrance to the site prior to the commencement and during the harvesting operations.  All those involved in tree felling must ensure that a felling licence has been issued by my Department.  It is an offence to fell trees without a licence unless an exemption applies. </p>  <p>  There are a number of exemptions provided for in the Act that mean, in specific circumstances, a tree felling licence is not required.  For example: </p>  <p>  - If a tree is located outside of a forest area and within an urban area (as defined by the Forestry Act 2014), </p>  <p>  - If the felling of a tree or trees is being carried out by a public authority in the course of their statutory functions,  </p>  <p>  - If a tree is within 10 metres of a public road and which, in the opinion of the owner is dangerous to persons using the public road on account of its age or condition does not require a felling licence.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that it is the responsibility of the landowner or the person felling the tree to ensure that they are acting within the law.  None of the exemptions under Section 19 of the Forestry Act 2014 serve to remove any restriction on the felling or removal of trees under (a) the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2013, (b) the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2000, or (c) any other enactment.</p>  <p>  It is an offence under the Wildlife Acts to cut or burn a hedgerow or trees in a hedgerow during the bird nesting season between the 1st of March and the 31st of August.  Hedgerows and trees in a line and other landscape features are designated features and removal may require screening for the likely impact on the environment or habitat.  Approval from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) may be required if the proposed removal is in a designated European Site such as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) or a Specially Protected Area or a Natura Heritage Area (NHA).  Offenders could be prosecuted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the National Parks and Wildlife Service and could also impact on those claiming the Basic Payment Scheme payments from the Department.</p>  <p>  Tree felling and tree planting that is carried out by public authorities is a matter for that authority and outside the remit of my Department.  However, developments requiring deforestation may require an Environmental Impact Assessment, Planning permission and a felling licence under the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015.  Forest owners are entitled to seek a written formal declaration under Section 5 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act 2000 (as amended) as to whether the local planning authority considers their proposed project requires planning permission.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to greatly increasing forest cover through the implementation of the Forestry Programme since 2015.  The continued expansion of the forest estate is a priority and generous grants and 15 year premiums are available to land owners who convert to forestry.  Between 2015 and 2018,  22,354 hectares of new forest has been planted by 3,504 forest owners.  Total expenditure in the same period for both existing and new forest owners and for promotional and ancillary activities under the Forestry Programme amounted to &euro;404.6 million.</p></reply>

The meeting was constructive and I believe there was good engagement across a range of important issues.</p>  <p>   I am very conscious of the role played by the beef sector in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland, as reflected in the D&aacute;il debate on this topic last week. </p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.</p>  <p>   I am aware of the current challenges facing beef farmers, with a sustained period of low prices, following on from additional costs last year arising from the unprecedented weather events.  However, as Minister, I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price; cattle prices are a matter for the processing industry and the farmers who supply it.  Cattle prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as the level of consumer demand, production levels and exchange rate differences.   Brexit also presents enormous challenges and ongoing uncertainty for the entire beef sector.</p>  <p>   I and my officials have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and in particular the beef sector, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts.  The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan at the end of January to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food sector, and on the beef sector in particular.  We discussed the unique exposure of the sector to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present.  I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and the food industry, including through traditional market supports such as intervention and Aids to Private Storage (APS), through exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and through increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.  Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.  </p>  <p>   In relation to bonus payments by factories, a Quality Payment System (QPS) providing for differentiated payments in respect of certain grades of cattle at slaughter plants was put in place in 2009.  Additional bonus payments, and the conditions required to obtain them, are determined by processors, to incentivise or reward production meeting the specifications of retail customers.  They are not conditions determined by law and my Department has no role in their operation. </p>  <p>   One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together.  I have highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency, and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including the development of Beef Producer Organisations.</p></reply>

Home charging is the most cost-effective way to charge an electric vehicle and is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland.  A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers. </p><p>Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network.  The project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models.</p><p>This project successfully completed the assessment stage and the validation stage is now underway.  On completion of this stage further detail on the project, including information in relation to the location of chargers and a timeline, will be set out.</p><p>At the end of 2018, there were over 7,600 electric vehicles on the road in Ireland &ndash; a doubling of the total from the previous year.

IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from Ireland&rsquo;s independent Technical Expert Group on Salmon (TEGOS), comprising scientists from a range of organisations. IFI also has to have regard to EU legislation, most notably the Habitats Directive under which salmon habitats are protected. </p>  <p>  Scientific and management assessments of each of the distinct salmon stocks, including the River Inney's stock, are carried out every year with IFI engaged in extensive stock monitoring, which feeds into the Scientific Group's annual reviews. An average of the 5 years of data is used to estimate expected returns for the coming year to ensure that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p>  <p>  Based on the annual assessment carried out for the 2019 season added to the previous 4 years' assessments, the Inney is significantly below its conservation limit, which is the number of returning adult fish required to sustain a healthy population. Therefore, the river is not open to harvest fishing either by rod and line or commercially for 2019. The river is open to catch and release angling only. The River Inney will again be included in the annual scientific assessments carried out later this year in anticipation of the 2020 season. </p>  <p>  The fundamental requirement of responsible fisheries management is that rational exploitation of the salmon resource is critically dependent on the sustainable availability of that resource. Harvest fishing, by any means, on the River Inney will be dependent on the availability of a sufficient surplus above its conservation limit to underpin exploitation, which aligns with the conservation imperative and which does not put the genetically unique stock at risk.</p></reply>

I have allocated &euro;85m to these schemes in 2019. As with all Exchequer funded programmes, these are managed within available resources.The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides fixed cash grants towards a range of energy efficiency measures. Homeowners must apply online for grant approval before employing a contractor from the SEAI's Register of Contractors, which is available on the SEAI website. Online approval will be made for eligible applicants within minutes, with an official letter of offer following within 5 working days. Homeowners then have 30 days to accept the offer and 6 months from the date of grant approval to complete their works. Payment is generally made within 4 weeks of submission of the final declaration of completed works. However, longer waiting times for payment can arise if a home is selected for an inspection of works. </p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme provides 50% funding towards a deep energy upgrade of a home. Homeowners must apply through a Deep Retrofit Service Provider who provide a timeline of works to the homeowner. The standard turnaround time from receipt of a valid application to approval is approximately 8 weeks though longer waiting times can occur for higher value project applications. A list of Service Providers is available on the SEAI's website.</p><p>The Better Energy Communities Scheme provides grants to community projects, led by a single project manager, that pull together buildings from the private, public and commercials sectors. The approval timeframe under this Scheme is generally in the order of 8-10 weeks, with longer waiting times associated with higher value project applications. A project approval tracker is available on</p><p><i> /</i>.</p><p>Works under this scheme must be competed by a given deadline in order for projects to receive funding within the calendar year. </p><p>The Warmer Homes Scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades free of charge to households on lower incomes. The works carried out in each house are determined by a technical survey of the home. In light of the scale of works and funding for individual interventions, current waiting time under the Scheme is up to 18 months in some instances. Homes that are recommended for deeper energy efficiency measures such as external wall insulation or heating upgrades face longer waiting times than those receiving simpler measures such as attic insulation. Waiting times are also impacted by the high demand for the Scheme and the capacity of SEAI's contractor panel to deliver deeper measures. The current contractor panel is in place until 2020</p><p>The issue of additional funding for the schemes will be considered as part of the annual Estimates process.</p></reply>

The SEAI works on an ongoing basis to identify opportunities to reduce application abandonment and increase the number of successful applications made to the schemes they administer. This focus includes significant insights from SEAI&rsquo;s Behavioural Economics Unit.  For example, in October of 2018, SEAI reviewed the online application wizard through which members of the public can apply for SEAI grant funding. The review identified a number of steps which could be removed in order to reduce application abandonment. Following the review, the problematic steps were removed from the application wizard resulting in a more streamlined process for users. This example of an innovative approach is in addition to the comprehensive information and guidance available from the SEAI through their website and information line.</p>  <p>  More generally, I will shortly be publishing a new All of Government Climate Plan which will include a number of actions aimed at improving supports for homeowners and increasing the number of retrofits.</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.  In light of its significant health and environmental benefits, it had been announced by a number of previous Ministers that the ban would be extended to the entire territory of the State. However, as the Deputy may be aware from recent press reports, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would legally challenge this decision. </p>  <p>  I have discussed this issue with the Attorney General, my Department is now working to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. However, pending the completion of this work I am aware of the need to provide clarity now to the public and to the trade to enable them adequately plan for purchases of stock for the 2019/20 heating season. I can confirm therefore that the current ban on bituminous coal will not be extended nationwide for the 2019/20 heating season.</p></reply>

In order to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies, especially the uptake of EVs, my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment jointly convened an inter-Departmental Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce.  The Taskforce includes representatives from across the public sector and has consulted widely with industry, stakeholders and representative groups. Phase 1 of its Work Programme focused exclusively on EVs.  </p><p>The role of public parking and parking charges were considered for the potential development of a new further incentive to EV ownership as part of that Phase. A Progress Report summarising the deliberations of the task force has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website (available at: <i></i>). Recommendations made by the task force were considered by Government ahead of Budgets 2018 and 2019, and a suite of continued and new EV supports was established, with a notable increase in demand for and take-up of EVs taking place in 2018 and 2019. </p><p>It is important to note that, under the Road Traffic Act, 1994, local authorities have the power to make bye-laws governing the type of paid parking controls in their areas. Therefore, it is a matter for each individual local authority to designate whether they apply and enforce free or paid parking for EVs while recharging.</p></reply>

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side.  </p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. </p>  <p>  Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port. However, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  I have met individually with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling, to discuss Brexit matters on three occasions since mid-2017. I most recently met the Secretary of State, at his request, in Dublin on 8 November last.  Our discussion fully respected the mandate of the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier. The Secretary of State outlined key areas of concern for the UK in relation to transport. </p>  <p>  While I did not specifically raise the issue of ownership of Rosslare Europort with the Secretary of State, I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including in relation to ports, aviation, road transport and cross-border rail services. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the port over the coming years. This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets and new technology.  The port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.</p></reply>

The extra opening hours are helping to meet demand. Priority is being given to UK licence exchanges with 38 staff working on UK licence exchange alone. Up to 600 licence exchanges are being processed daily.</p><p>When attending any of the 36 NDLS centres nationally for any reason, to apply for a learner permit or a driving licence, or to exchange a driving licence, it is recommended that an appointment be made. Due to the demand for UK licence exchanges, it may not be possible to make an appointment in time before 12 April deadline. The NDLS also provides approximately 1,300 slots per day for walk-in appointments. There will be a longer wait time for walk-ins, but I am in formed that no-one has been turned away from a centre and that the queues are not too long. The walk-in slots equate to about 50% of the total slots available. Walk-in visits are encouraged before 11 a.m. and after 3 p.m. to avoid peak times. Details of the centres&rsquo; opening hours are available on <i>www.ndls.ie.</i></p><p>Booking availability has been increased from 4 to 6 weeks ahead to facilitate those who may be renewing a licence or learner permit and are not in an immediate rush. This has helped to reduce the pressure and allow more walk-in slots for exchange applications.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-04-02a.1265.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019040200075#WRY02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 447 and 448 together.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that its approach to preparing for Brexit is aimed at minimising the impact it could have on our trade and our economy while seeking an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the additional controls at ports and at Dublin airport that would be required in a no deal Brexit scenario is being co-ordinated by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with representation from a range of stakeholders across Government.  The group has focused on three locations for which we are heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK, namely, Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The Office of Public Works has been tasked with delivering the required facilities for these agriculture, health and customs checks at these locations. Cork Airport and the Port of Cork are not expected to require any additional infrastructure to deal with any potential changes resulting from the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union.</p>  <p>  The establishment of air transport connections are the result of commercial agreements between airlines and airports.  I have continued to reiterate the importance of the aviation industry, including airports, taking steps to prepare for Brexit and where possible to reduce their exposure.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the European Commission last year put forward a draft legislative proposal aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no deal Brexit scenario.  The measures proposed will, subject to reciprocity on the part of the UK, provide a large degree of certainty to the Irish aviation sector and to the travelling public.  The situation was further clarified on 7 March 2019, when the UK confirmed its intention to reciprocate the proposed measures. While this cannot mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario, or the assurances contained in the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement, the fears that aircraft might not be able to fly are being addressed.</p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding from Tourism Ireland for cooperative marketing activity.  Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely.  An increased budget allocation in Tourism Ireland for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services.</p>  <p>   Cork Port is currently undertaking major capital infrastructure programmes and these programmes will enhance national and international connectivity, and provide for future increases in trade and national port capacity requirements by facilitating more vessels, larger sized vessels and increased tonnage and throughput. </p>  <p>  My Department has also sought to assess the existing maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge.  My Department has established that there is capacity in ports other than Dublin and Rosslare that could be of some assistance in the event of a no deal Brexit.  The main spare capacity available in 2019 is in relation to Lift-on/ Lift -off (LO-LO), in Cork, among others, and for bulk, rather than in respect of Roll-on / Roll-off traffic.  However, shipping services are market driven and I believe that ferry operators will respond to economic developments and increase or decrease in capacity in response to market developments.  There have already been responses from the shipping companies adding additional freight capacity on direct sailings to the continent, for example, Brittany Ferries has established a direct route from Cork to Santander in Spain, creating capacity for 35,000 additional freight units annually.</p>  <p>  Should there be modal shift from RORO to LOLO the Port of Cork has spare capacity to cater for additional LOLO. </p>  <p>  In addition, strengthening access routes to Ireland&rsquo;s ports through investment to upgrade and enhance the road transport network is, and remains, a Government priority.  Examples of such investments include the planned N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy Road to improve access to the Port of Cork.</p></reply>

It is important to remember that driver licensing law exists to ensure that people licensed to drive on our roads meet high standards of safety.  The standards for testing drivers are set at EU level.</p>  <p>  An EU driving licence is exchangeable for an Irish driving licence, except where the licence issued by the other Member State was itself issued in exchange for a licence from a state that is not a Member State, or a state that Ireland does not have a licence exchange agreement with.  For example, if a Zimbabwean licence was exchanged for a UK licence, that UK licence can not then be exchanged for an Irish licence, as Ireland does not have a driving licence exchange agreement with Zimbabwe.</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchange licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence.  While they will have to go through the normal driver learning process, as they have a full but non-exchange licence they can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and they do not have to wait the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.</p></reply>

The establishment of additional controls at ports and at Dublin airport that would be required in a no deal Brexit scenario is being co-ordinated by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with representation from a range of stakeholders across Government.  The group has focused on three locations for which we are heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK, namely, Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The Office of Public Works has been tasked with delivering the required facilities for these agriculture, health and customs checks at these locations.</p>  <p>  Airlines and shipping companies operate as independent, market-driven commercial companies and planning and preparations in the context of Brexit are operational matters for each. However, I am aware through consultations by my Department with shipping and airline companies that they are contingency planning, including for a no-deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding from Tourism Ireland for cooperative marketing activity. Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely. An increased budget allocation in Tourism Ireland for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services.</p>  <p>  In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. Following a series of recent meetings with the major ferry companies operating at our ports, I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports.  These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, which will operate between Dublin and France. Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.</p>  <p>  In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity.  Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme.  There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports.</p></reply>

My officials have responded separately to the childcare forum which wrote the letter referred to in the Deputy's question. </p>  <p>  My Department funds a number of early learning and care and school age childcare programmes.  Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. My Department believes that our approach to compliance and supporting services strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended.</p>  <p>  A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;, the most recent of which was published on 9th August 2018. Compliance with these rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible.  </p>  <p>  I very much appreciate that community childcare settings provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate their stated concerns regarding their sustainability. Hence, significant support is available to them to bring their service onto a more sustainable footing, while being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.  </p>  <p>  My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.  </p>  <p>  Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far. I would recommend all other services to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) will replace the targeted schemes later this year. My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the NCS was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind. The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses.

Primarily legislation relating to this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills under the Educational Welfare Act 2000.</p>  <p>   In that Act, &ldquo;child&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a person resident in the State who has reached the age  of 6 years and who&mdash;</p>  <p>  (a) has not reached the age of 16 years, or</p>  <p>  (b) has not completed 3 years of post-primary education,</p>  <p>  whichever occurs later, but shall not include a person who has reached the age of 18  years;&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service (EWS) in Tusla established by the Act of 2000 has functions described under that Act, one of which in Section 10 (1) is to &ldquo;ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain  minimum education&rdquo; and in that regard, the EWS maintain a register of all children, aged six years and over, who are in receipt of an education in a place other than a recognised school (Section 14(1)).  Under the Act, it is the responsibility of a parent who &ldquo;chooses to educate, or have educated, his or her child [6 years or over  &ndash; see definition above], in a place other than a recognised school, he or she  shall apply to the EWS to have the child concerned registered in the  register&rdquo;.  There is then an onus on the EWS to inspect such provision to ensure  that the child is receiving a certain minimum education.  </p>  <p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) was never intended to delay children's transition to primary school. Therefore it is important to note that &ldquo;overage exemption&rdquo; refers only to an exemption to the maximum eligible age for participation in the ECCE programme. It does not provide any exemption from the requirements under law for children aged 6 years and over to attend primary school or otherwise receive a certain minimum education.  </p>  <p>  Supports are available for school aged children through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), affiliated to the Department of Education and Skills, to support children in a primary school setting. I would encourage this family to contact their local Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) for further assistance.</p></reply>

Given the large amount of public money that is used in funding these programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability. My Department believes that our approach to compliance and supporting services strikes a necessary and appropriate balance. Our approach involves setting out the rules for the receipt of State funding, supporting providers to deliver services, and at the same time, the approach offers assurances to the taxpayer that the funding assigned is being spent as it was intended. </p><p>A high level of compliance with the rules of the various childcare schemes is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department must be compliant with the <i>&lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo;,</i>the most recent of which was published on 9<sup>th</sup>August 2018. Compliance with these rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Because subsidies for the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment), this is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. As funding is based on attendance, the Department cannot restore funding which was provided on the basis of registrations which did not match actual attendance. </p><p>I very much appreciate that community childcare settings, such as the ones referred to in your question, provide a valuable service to children and families across the country. I also appreciate the impact reduced income, as a result of compliance visits, can have on their service. Hence, significant support is available to them to ensure  sustainable, while being necessarily compliant with scheme rules.</p><p>My Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assesses services facing challenges. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.  </p><p>Results from Pobal compliance visits for the first part of the programme year 2018/2019 show some issues in relation to non-compliance which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I am encouraged however that most services have engaged constructively with the process so far.  I would recommend these services, and any other service, to get in contact with Pobal or their local City / County Childcare Committee if they need support or advice, or if they believe a sustainability issue arises.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) will replace the targeted schemes later this year. My Department&rsquo;s policy relating to the NCS was informed by evidence and with the best interests of children and families in mind. The legislation that I brought forward, supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.</p><p>The new scheme will not have a snapshot window. Its attendance rules will seek to reflect the reality of children and parents' lives and the need for services to operate as businesses. The attendance rules will reflect a certain degree of flexibility whilst honouring the requirement to ensure that Exchequer funding is used for the purposes it was intended. </p><p>My Department has begun to roll out a major national information campaign in relation to how this new scheme will operate. A significant amount of time will be invested in working with services to ensure that they are ready for it.</p><p>Under NCS, subsidies will be paid to a service provider for a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the scheme will contain rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is absent or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  The rules have been developed to be fair, proportionate and child-centred, while also being clear and consistent.  Importantly they will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  My Department has worked hard to ensure that they will not disadvantage services for what can be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are managed and allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the last four budgets, now totalling &euro;575m per year. Community services access much of this growing investment. Turnover for many services has increased quite substantially (given that the number of servicers operating has increased only slightly) and co-payments / top-up payments made by parents has decreased, both measures assisting many services to strengthen their sustainability and review their business model to meet compliance requirements. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school age childcare in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. This is in line with the commitment made in First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, I published last November.</p></reply>

It will ultimately replace all previous targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme, providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies. The development of this scheme is a significant move forward in delivering quality, accessible, affordable Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare to families throughout Ireland. </p><p>When the scheme is introduced in October 2019, many families will become eligible for childcare subsidies for the first time and many more families will qualify for increased levels of subsidy.  The Scheme also provides a vital platform for future investment in the sector. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, recognising that childcare needs are different for each family.  In creating a single, national scheme, it was important to recognise these differences and create a system that could respond to them without affecting service operations for providers.  For this reason, subsidies will be awarded as an hourly rate, along with a maximum number of hours for which that rate is payable.  The hourly rate of subsidy illustrates to parents their level of subsidy and will not affect service operations.</p><p>Parents and providers will continue to work together as they currently do to decide on the amount of childcare that is needed and can be provided.  Providers will continue to set their own fees, sessions and admissions policies.  The scheme will pay subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent.  </p><p>As with the current targeted subsidy schemes, payments are subject to a child regularly using the childcare place.  In other words, the Scheme will have rules in relation to circumstances where a child leaves the service, is continuously absent from the service, or is not fully using the agreed place over a prolonged period.  These rules will be child-centred, fair and proportionate, clear and consistent and will recognise the need for flexibility for parents.  The rules will not disadvantage services for what would be considered minor non-attendances. At the same time, they will recognise the need to protect State finances by ensuring that Exchequer funds are used to support the maximum number of families in need of financial support, represent value for money for taxpayers, and are allocated in accordance with robust and appropriate procedures.</p><p>On 11th March, I launched a communications campaign for the National Childcare Scheme.  The campaign encompasses a major nationwide training programme for providers.  I would encourage all providers to sign up for a local training session on the new website- <i>www.ncs.gov.ie</i>- so that they can learn more about the operation of the scheme, including the rules on attendance and payment.  </p><p>Finally, for services which are facing issues with financial sustainability, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system which is administered by Pobal. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance.  Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges; these may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.  Any service which is currently experiencing sustainability challenges, or which fears that the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme could potentially affect its sustainability, should contact its local Childcare Committee or Pobal.</p></reply>

In order to be eligible for the ECCE programme in September, a child must have turned 2 years 8 months on or before 31st August and must be less than 5 years 7 months at the end of June of the pre-school year.</p>  <p>  Parents of children with special needs may apply for an ECCE Overage Exemption on behalf of their child for the 2019/2020 pre-school year provided that the child has not availed of their full ECCE allocation of 2 years and that the child will not reach 6 years of age during the exemption year. Applications for ECCE Overage Exemptions must be submitted in writing to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and must be accompanied by a letter of recommendation from a medical specialist (not a GP or public health nurse) stating that it is in the best interest of the child to avail of a further year in pre-school. </p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a model of support designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the ECCE programme. AIM support is currently only available to children registered on the ECCE programme (or other DCYA childcare programme where the child is also eligible for ECCE). AIM supports may be applied for in respect of a child participating on ECCE through an overage exemption.</p>  <p>  AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, AIM Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting.</p>  <p>  However, when a child has exhausted their entitlement to 2 full years of pre-school and is no longer registered on ECCE, AIM supports are not available to that child. The HSE may be in a position to provide support to a child in this situation. Where the HSE has provided support for a child attending their first and second year of pre-school and the parents wish to access support for a third year, the HSE will attempt to facilitate this request, subject to the availability of resources and other service demands.</p>  <p>  Finally, supports are available for school-aged children through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), an agency of the Department of Education and Skills, to support children in a primary school setting.</p></reply>

However, the intention was only to identify areas of immediate priority for the purposes of the exercise in question, rather than to compile a definitive list of blackspots across the country. </p><p>While the exercise was informative, it was not comprehensive.  Of the thirty one Local Authorities, only seventeen returned data to feed into the exercise. The majority of Local Authorities did not have the capacity to carry out technical testing. Furthermore, the methods used to collect the data varied. </p><p>Table 1 provides details of these seventeen Local Authorities and the number of blackspots they each identified.</p><p>During the mapping exercise, mobile network operators and infrastructure providers were increasing the number of mobile phone sites in service, as well as upgrading existing networks. As a consequence, the data that was collected in 2018 only represents a snapshot in time for certain areas and could not be interpreted as a definitive source of information regarding mobile phone blackspots.  Nor would it be a fair reflection of the current situation, as network developments are taking place on an on-going basis. </p><p>ComReg recently published a digital map of outdoor mobile phone coverage for 2G, 3G and 4G services which is more comprehensive than the earlier mapping exercise. This map shows the quality and prevalence of mobile phone coverage across the country.</p><p>With regard to funding and support, my Department provided &euro;35,000 to each Local Authority in 2018 to support the appointment of a Broadband Officer. Broadband Officers are tasked with co-ordinating broadband and telecommunications development in their Local Authority areas and their role is much broader than identifying mobile phone blackspots. Broadband Officer funding increased to &euro;42,000 for each Local Authority for 2019.  </p><p>My Department has also assigned liaison officers to support Local Authority Broadband Officers.  At the implementation stage of the blackspot data collection exercise, a technical information document was provided to every Local Authority to guide them in their work.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with Local Authorities and telecommunications providers throughout 2019 to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted to areas most in need.</p><p><b>Table 1 - Local Authorities who provided data on Mobile Phone Blackspots</b><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Local Authority</th><th>Blackspots </th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Carlow</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Donegal</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>3 </td><td>Galway County Council</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Kerry</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Kildare</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Limerick</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Longford</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Mayo</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Meath</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Sligo</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Tipperary</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Waterford</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Cork County</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>433</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  It is now timely that the data should be reviewed to ensure that we are supporting the areas of greatest need under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  I therefore commenced a review of the programme in November 2018 to examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  The review will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R in the future.  </p>  <p>  The process began last November with a targeted consultation meeting with a number of experts on rural development issues, to provide some guidance on the matter.  My Department has also been exploring the possibility of the NIRSA Institute carrying out work on the 2016 Census data.   </p>  <p>  I envisage that a wider stakeholder consultation will also take place before the review is completed.  I anticipate that this consultation will take place in Quarter 3 this year.  Once completed, the review will help to inform the design of future CL&Aacute;R programmes. </p></reply>

Based on the current customer volumes and the intercounty mix of recipients, the forecast full-year cost of increasing rent limits by 10% would be in the region of &euro;17.4 million.</p><p>However, it must be emphasised that rent supplement is only one part of the Government&rsquo;s intervention within the private rental sector. The other two main schemes - rental accommodation scheme (approx. 18,900 claimants) and the housing assistance payment scheme (approx. 45,000 claimants) - also use rent supplement&rsquo;s rent limits. Any costing exercise for rent limits needs to consider the cost impact for both of these two schemes, along with other ancillary schemes using rent limits as part of their pricing strategies operated by local authorities.</p><p>Any increases made to rent limits may add further inflationary pressure on pricing expectations of landlords; this will be of most concern to lower-percentile property values within the rental market, i.e., low-income working families renting in urban areas would be the group most likely affected.</p><p>In recognition of the ongoing rental market difficulties, the Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case flexible payment policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  To date, approximately 13,500 cases have been provided additional flexible payment arrangements, i.e. have received support in excess of the prevailing rent limits. Rent supplement recipients by county along with the payments made under the case-by-case flexible payment National Framework since its inception in 2015 are provided in the below tabular statement.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Tabular Statement: <b>Total Increased Rental Payments by County and Rent Supplement Recipients.</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Recipients End of February 2019</th><th>Cumulative Cases 2015 - 19 March 2019</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>209</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>187</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>108</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>2,630</td><td>766</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>87</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>11,659</td><td>7,922</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>1,050</td><td>228</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>742</td><td>364</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>992</td><td>712</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>116</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>213</td><td>187</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>83</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>465</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>120</td><td>368</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>185</td><td>208</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>334</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>271</td><td>510</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>106</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>80</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>209</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>73</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>235</td><td>375</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>118</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>594</td><td>487</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>712</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>1,012</td><td>541</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>22,590</td><td>13,502</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Any decision to extend the duration of maternity leave, including that for families with multiple births, would be the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  My Department has responsibility for the payment of maternity benefit which is provided for in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).</p>  <p>  There is a provision of &euro;256m for maternity benefit for 2019.  The most recent CSO data from 2016 indicates that there were 1,215 instances of multiple births in Ireland, representing 1.9% of all births.  Based on an apportionment of 1.9% of maternity benefit recipients, the cost of extending the period of this benefit from 26 weeks to 30 or 34 weeks could cost some &euro;724,000 and &euro;1,447,000 respectively.  There would also be additional costs for employers including substitution and public sector pay costs which would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently announced the introduction of a new paid parental benefit for parents which will support parents to spend additional time with their babies and provide more flexibility in managing a work-life balance.

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. Estimated expenditure on WFP in 2018 was approximately &euro;430 million and it is currently paid to almost 54,000 families in respect of some 122,000 children.</p>  <p>  To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week. </p>  <p>  For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for WFP and working on a casual basis (that is, up to and including 3 days per week) the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) scheme provides in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments .  </p>  <p>  Apart from the jobseeker schemes, if a person cannot meet the 19 hours WFP threshold or if their hours vary significantly from week to week, the Department offers a number of other schemes which can provide income support that can be combined with earnings from employment, subject to each individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  These include One-Parent Family Payment (OFP), the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST), and the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) scheme </p>  <p>  Further reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would potentially have significant expenditure implications which are not possible to quantify. The number of families working between 15-18 hours who are earning below the relevant WFP thresholds is currently unknown. Also, reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access WFP from 19 to 15 could have a number of behavioural effects the increased cost of which would be difficult to predict. These effects include: </p>  <p>  -  reducing the incentive to increase part-time hours, resulting in recipients on the minimum 19 hours threshold reducing their hours of work; </p>  <p>  -  attracting new recipients currently on higher wages above the WFP threshold, who might decide to reduce their hours in order to qualify.</p>  <p>  -  greater dependency on WFP to support very low earnings, with significant budgetary implications.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  The longer term goal of WFP, as an incentive to take up and remain in work, could be compromised if the nature of the work taken up is not ultimately sustainable without ever-increasing and perhaps ultimately unsustainable levels of subvention.</p></reply>

There are currently 43,439 children who benefit from the allowance.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child,  including additional transport costs where they arise.  </p>  <p>  The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 939,000 customers with direct eligibility.  Following Budget 2019 the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Providing an estimate of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance is difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided, and not by the increased number.  The fact that many operators have reduced fares for children and that in some cases children under five years of age can travel for free would also have to be taken into account.  Taking all of this into consideration the yearly cost of the measure suggested by the Deputy may be in the region of &euro;5 million, however this is a tentative estimate. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to all children that are in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payment of CA are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness/disability, unemployment or caring.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income. A married couple with 2 children could have weekly earnings of &euro;734 net of PRSI, superannuation and union subscription costs and still qualify for the full rate of Carer's Allowance. This is equivalent to over &euro;38,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018, there were 79,914 people in receipt of CA.  The projected expenditure on CA in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million.</p>  <p>  It has not been possible in the time available to make a robust estimate of the costs requested using administrative and other data of the level of additional programme costs, particularly as such a change would be highly sensitive to the income distribution in households at the time of implementation. However, the Department did make an estimate in 2017 of the estimated cost of increasing the weekly income disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance by &euro;51 for a couple and by &euro;25.50 for a single person using administrative records and various assumptions.  This analysis suggested at that time that it would cost in the region of &euro;51 million (an increase of 7.3% on the programme allocation at the time).  The estimated cost of the higher increase specified in the question would be expected to be several multiples of this amount.  Any changes to qualifying criteria would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

It was initially established to enhance the employability of unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  In doing so, its objective was, and remains, to help long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce.</p>  <p>  Following the review of CE in 2015, the scheme was categorised into two strands, Social Inclusion and Activation.  This was to acknowledge that not all placements are the same. Social Inclusion placements are more suited to adults who need additional supports, for example older unemployed workers, people with a disability, travellers, homeless people, refugees, those requiring drug rehabilitation and ex-offenders whereas the activation placements are more directly related to the labour market relevant work experience.  The Activation and Social Inclusion placements are currently governed under the same rules, eligibility criteria and period of placement.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that these Social Inclusion placements require a separate focus to ensure that those who are very distant from the labour market and who are interested in working and delivering services in their local community have the opportunity to do so.  It is also my strong view that the local services which are supported by these Social Inclusion placements must be safeguarded into the future.  </p>  <p>  On this basis Government agreed to establish an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to explore the most appropriate organisational arrangements, including which Department should host the CE Social Inclusion schemes. </p>  <p>  The interdepartmental group will assess the best course of action required so as to protect the governance and successes that we have seen in CE activation whilst also establishing the appropriate structure for the social inclusion placements. The first meeting of the group was held on 26th March.  It was agreed at the meeting to undertake a consultation process in the near future with all key stakeholders including Sponsor Organisations.  I have received a number of submissions to date and these will be included in the deliberations.</p>  <p>  The Group will report to Cabinet Committee B, dealing with Social Policy and Public Services with the outcome of the deliberations of the group prior to a final decision by the Government.  It is expected that the IDG will report to Cabinet by end Q2 2019.</p></reply>

Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks.

While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcome of their review in writing. </p>  <p>  Where possible, reviews will be processed based on information already held by the Department. For the majority of pensioners the next letter they receive from the Department (after the first letter) will be a review outcome letter. Where additional information is required to complete the review, a written request is being sent to the pensioner directly. Almost 24,000 requests for information issued in January and another 11,000 will be issuing to customers in the coming weeks. I would urge anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that their review can be processed.</p>  <p>    I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This includes the construction of social homes on the land of local authorities and construction delivery in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Local authorities are also working in partnership with private developers to deliver social housing construction through turnkey arrangements.

These Regulations focus on tenant safety and include new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  In August 2017, my Department published a guidance document to assist and support local authorities in implementing the new Regulations.</p><p>All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority, previously supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from a portion of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p><p>Between 2005 and 2017, over &euro;36 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation. Over 229,000 inspections were carried out during this period.</p><p>The Rental Strategy recognises the need for additional resources to be provided to local authorities to aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations.

When the additional discretion available to homeless households in the Dublin region is removed, 26.6% of households nationally were benefiting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 16.2% above rent limits provided. This increases to 21.8% when the Dublin region homeless area data is included.  </p><p>I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections available to all private rented tenancies. </p>  <p>  For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016). Rent Pressure Zones are designated Local Electoral Areas or administrative areas of local authorities in which rent increases are restricted to a maximum of 4% per annum.

The scheme applies to adaptations that are necessary to address the needs of older people or people with a disability or for extensions in cases of overcrowding. My Department is currently finalising the funding requirements for all local authorities under the scheme in 2019; in the meantime they have been advised to continue with the programme pending their 2019 allocation.

This alteration is planned to take place when the new Councils take office after the local elections in late May 2019. The Act provides for the establishment of a statutory Cork Boundary Alteration Implementation Oversight Committee to ensure that the challenges of implementation are addressed effectively and to oversee arrangements for the alteration of the boundary in accordance with an implementation plan.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation process rests primarily with the two local authorities, subject to guidance and oversight by the Oversight Committee and compliance with the Implementation Plan. The Committee has advised my Department that work is continuing in a timely fashion towards the transfer day of 31 May 2019. The statutory implementation plan was produced in February and I am satisfied with the engagement and the level of readiness in the local authorities and the implementation oversight by the Oversight Committee.</p>  <p>  My understanding is that it has been agreed that the County Council will accept, process and finish out grant applications received until 30 May 2019, at which stage new applications in the relevant area will then be the responsibility of the City Council from 31 May 2019. </p></reply>

The KCS policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire and sets out national norms, standards and targets against which local authorities can benchmark their fire services.</p>  <p>  Over the course of 2014/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board commissioned an "External Validation Group" (EVG) to visit each of the twenty seven local authority fire services. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo; arising from this work. The report concluded, inter alia, that local authorities benchmarked their fire services against the national standards and national norms, and a strong degree of consistency, linked to area risk categorisation, now exists in fire service provision; and all local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as minimum standards.</p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the number and type of fire appliances maintained is a matter for each fire authority having regard to the assessment of their individual fire cover needs and the provision and management of a fleet adequate to their requirements. As part of my Department's fire services capital programme, I announced a new national joint-procurement programme in 2017 to purchase 20 new fire appliances. Dublin City Council's Fire Service received an allocation for three new &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances. In 2015, under a similar programme, Dublin's Fire Service also received an allocation for three &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances. Dublin City Council's Fire Service requested, and received approval, to substitute the cost of one of the appliances to purchase a pre-used turntable ladder. In addition to these allocations, since 2008, my Department has also funded four &lsquo;Class B&rsquo; appliances and one turntable ladder for Dublin.</p>  <p>  In relation to Fire Appliance Delta 126, referenced in the question, my Department was not party to the purchase of that appliance and the information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department. It may be available directly from the Fire Authority, in this instance Dublin City Council in respect of Dublin Fire Brigade.</p></reply>

This can result in some local authorities receiving additional funding later in the year, over and above their original allocation, and this will continue to be the case in order to ensure the highest possible level of funding drawdown by the local authorities.</p></reply>

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the 2000 Act and is a reserved function of the elected members. </p><p>Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to  the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions. </p><p>My Department  launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI). Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 14,930 homes. </p><p>Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that was published by my Department in December 2018. The report is available at the following link: </p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/national_taking_in_charge_initiative_report_dec2018.pdf.  </i></p><p>The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water. </p><p>Ultimately, however, progression of individual developments through the taking-in-charge process is a matter for the relevant housing developer, the residents in such developments and the relevant local authorities, following the procedures laid out in Section 180.</p><p>The National Development Plan, published last year, includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure, commencing with an estimates provision of &euro;6 million in 2019.  The multi-annual programme will be initiated through the invitation of project bids from local authorities followed by their evaluation by an Expert Panel, set up by my Department, to independently evaluate the bid projects and make recommendations on suitable projects to be approved for funding.  It is expected that approval of projects for this first cycle multi-annual programme will take place in Q2 2019.</p></reply>

Isolated populations, such as at the Bull Island, are especially vulnerable to extinctions, given the absence of connectivity with neighbouring populations.</p><p>International best practice on reintroductions is provided in the IUCN Guidelines for Reintroductions and other Conservation Translocations. [<i></i>]</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service of this Department rely on those guidelines when considering licence applications for reintroductions and translocations. Those Guidelines outline the requirements that need to be met to ensure that reintroductions &ldquo;yield a measurable conservation benefit at the levels of a population, species or ecosystem.&rdquo;  Moving animals to Bull Island at this time would not meet those criteria. </p><p>There are therefore no plans to reintroduce hares to the North Bull Island. My Department will however continue to liaise with Dublin City Council on the management of Bull Island and have not ruled out the potential for a translocation of hares to Bull Island sometime in the future should conditions become more favourable for a long-term, sustainable hare population.</p></reply>

As such it was recommended to the local authority for inclusion in its Record of Protected Structures and it is a protected structure within the meaning of the Planning and Development Acts.</p>  <p>  My role with regard to the protection and management of our architectural heritage is set out in the provisions of relevant legislation, as are the roles of local authorities and the responsibilities of owners.</p>  <p>  Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives primary responsibility to planning authorities (i.e. local authorities) to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including particular structures on their Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  Under Section 59 of the Planning and Development Acts, the serving of endangerment notices on protected structures is a reserved function of the local authority. As the owner of this protected structure, the local authority has a duty under Section 58 of the Acts to ensure the structure does not become endangered. I am informed that there is considerable work underway by the County Council to identify a course of action that would see this element of the town&rsquo;s history  saved and protected into the future. I understand that this will require a significant investment.</p>  <p>  In terms of the support that my Department can offer, my role in relation to protected structures is mainly advisory. The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage identifies, records, and evaluates the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland, as an aid to its protection and conservation.  As Minister, I recommend structures rated as being of regional importance or above to the planning authorities for inclusion on their Record of Protected Structures.  However, the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a Record of Protected Structures remains a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS), which are administered by local authorities. On Thursday 28 March, I announced funding of &euro;4.3m for 478 projects under these schemes in 2019. Details of these projects and the funding are available on my Department's website and local authority websites.</p></reply>

This includes social media and videos and is centred on creativity and culture. That contract has now just expired and  a new procurement process for digital content services is currently underway. </p>  <p>  A separate procurement process was run in 2018 for media buying services which was awarded to Mindshare. This essentially involves developing strategic plans to promote specific elements of the Creative Ireland Programme (for example the forthcoming Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g) using curated content, features and editorial, across all media channels, including social and digital platforms.</p></reply>
