A date for the next meeting has not yet been scheduled.</p><p>In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet Committees, I often meet with Ministers on an individual basis to focus on particular issues. In this regard, I meet regularly with Minister Harris to discuss issues relating to our health service.</p><p>This year will see the highest ever level of health funding in the history of the State, in order to transform our health service to one that can meet the changing needs of the population and be resilient to challenges presented by changing demographics. </p><p>We have also committed close to &euro;11 billion in capital investment over the next 10 years in the National Development Plan to provide the infrastructure required for expanded community and acute care. </p><p>While there is a need for increased investment in the health service, reform and productivity gains must happen in tandem. These gains are not always easily realised and requires a long-term strategic approach. </p><p>The Government is advancing a significant programme of reform to ensure meaningful and sustained improvement in the health service in the future. </p><p>The publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019, the first of what will be annual plans, sets out in a detailed and measurable way how the ambitious 10-year reform programme will be advanced this year. The first quarter progress report for this year is completed and all 28 deliverables are on track.</p><p>The guiding principle of Sl&aacute;intecare is to provide the right care, in the right place, at the right to time. Recent Sl&aacute;intecare advancements include:</p><blockquote>&middot;  From 1 April this year reduced prescription charges, reduced drug payment scheme thresholds, and increased GP visit card income thresholds came into effect. This is a step forward in benefitting potentially hundreds of thousands of people when these three actions are taken together. <br /><br />&middot;  On 11 June Government approved the general scheme of a bill to change how productive assets are treated under the Nursing Home Support Scheme which will positively affect families who have family farms and businesses but now require nursing home care.  <br /><br />&middot;  An agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on a major package of GP contractual reforms that will benefit patients and make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors. <br /><br />&middot;  The HSE (Governance) Act 2019 was signed into law by the President earlier this month. The Act provides for a new HSE board to strengthen the management, governance and accountability of the HSE.<br /><br />&middot;  Other developments include Medicinal Cannabis Access Programme.  All of the new respite houses are now open and in operation.</blockquote></reply>

Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement Programme, which is currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon and Jordan. </p>  <p>  To date, a total of 2,519 people have arrived in Ireland under the various strands of the IRPP, 45 of whom are unaccompanied minors.  An IRPP mission to Lebanon in March 2019 selected 331 refugees for resettlement to Ireland.  A further mission to Jordan this July will select approximately 300 refugees. This will complete Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to admit 1,985 programme refugees under the Resettlement strand of the IRPP.  The remaining refugees are due to arrive in Ireland during the remainder of 2019.</p>  <p>  The IRPP programme also includes the IRPP Humanitarian Admission Programme under which Irish citizens, programme refugees, Convention refugees and persons with subsidiary protection can apply for family members to come to Ireland where those persons are living in the top 10 refugee generating countries.  530 persons are being admitted to Ireland this year under that programme.  </p>  <p>  Of those who have arrived in Ireland to date, 1,875 persons have been provided with permanent housing by local authorities.  In addition, 106 persons have been housed in accommodation through the Irish Red Cross.  9 persons are participating in the Community Sponsorship scheme which is an innovative scheme whereby local communities directly support the process of integrating refugees into their communities.  Taken together, 1,995 people who arrived under the IRPP have been resettled in communities across Ireland.  This represents 86% of the arrivals so far under the resettlement and relocation strands of the programme.   </p>  <p>  At present, 365 persons from the two strands of the programme are living in Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres (EROCs).  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600074#WRB01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 48 together.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department has been encountering significant upward pressure on its accommodation portfolio. This pressure has increased further in recent months with an increase in the number of persons claiming international protection and a growth in the percentage of protection applicants who require assistance with accommodation.  There are upwards of 700 persons residing in accommodation who have permission to remain in Ireland or who have received international protection status. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the State can continue to provide accommodation for all protection applicants while experiencing a shortage of accommodation nationwide, RIA has, since last September, been forced to arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity.  This was done by contacting a large number of accommodation providers and also through a national print advertisement seeking expressions of interest for providing emergency accommodation on a short term basis. RIA is hoping to increase the capacity of the mainstream system by opening new centres.  </p>  <p>  In December 2018, the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department was informed that residents in emergency accommodation had been removed from their accommodation to facilitate a private function. On behalf of my Department, I wish to state that this was wholly inappropriate and that the Department had no prior knowledge of this decision. RIA addressed the issue directly with the service provider at the time and received assurances it would not happen again. I can assure Deputies that RIA remains in regular contact with emergency accommodation providers and in regular contact with residents through on-site clinics. I am satisfied that this was an isolated incident.</p>  <p>  In order to secure suitable accommodation centres for those in the international protection process, my Department is in the process of tendering for suitable premises throughout the country. In relation to Monaghan, a tender covering the border region will be advertised later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600074#WRB01400"><p>I wish to state once again my Department's sincere regret at the circumstances which led to a person being buried without her friends being informed. It is clear that there was a breakdown in communication in this particular case, which the Department very much regrets.</p>  <p>  Where a person dies while they are being provided with accommodation by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, RIA works closely with the centre manager to assist the family in accessing the supports by the State, and to ensure that any residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them. All deaths and serious incidents that occur within accommodation centres provided by the Department are referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and the Garda&iacute; in turn refer all deaths to the local coroner's office.</p>  <p>  In light of what happened in this particular case, RIA is examining its protocols around fatalities in order to ensure that this situation does not arise again, and in particular to ensure there is a formal record of the interest of the Department in knowing any proposed arrangements for inquest or burial.  </p>  <p>  In an effort to better understand the communications between all parties concerned, a senior official from the Department of Justice and Equality spoke to the Galway West coroner on the 7 June 2019.  I should say that the coroner noted the efforts that had been made to identify the person's next of kin. </p>  <p>  While thankfully, the occurrences of deaths where the deceased remains unidentified, unclaimed or where no next of kin is identified, are very rare, the Department will take all possible steps to ensure that this outcome is avoided in future and that friends who have expressed an interest are properly informed through appropriate communications with the coronial service and by liaising with other relevant agencies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600074#WRB01800"><p>The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extending the review to cover the period 2003-2017. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently working, in conjunction with the CSO and the Policing Authority, to resolve this issue.  This is obviously a time consuming and complex process but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate so that the public can have confidence in the data which informs the development of effective policies by the Department of Justice and Equality. The review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has not been published as it is not yet complete, however the details will be made public on completion.  It is important to bear in mind that issues with the consistent recording of crime data are not unique to this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.</p>  <p>   While the most recent publication of the official recorded crime statistics for Q1 2019 remain 'Under Reservation', it is important to note the CSO, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, continue to make good progress on returning the crime figures to the higher standard expected of our national crime statistics. It should also be recognised that the issues with the crime statistics is by no means unique to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as I mentioned earlier, similar issues have been reported in other jurisdictions including the UK, Australia, Denmark and US.  That said, I am determined that this body of work be completed as soon as possible and I welcome the continued diligence of the Policing Authority in monitoring this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600074#WRB02100"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is coordinating the whole-of-Government response to Brexit.  In this capacity, he is working closely with all Ministers and Departments, including my Department, to address in a joined up manner, the many challenges Brexit will present.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with Government policy, there are no plans to provide for a hard border on the island. However, it has long been recognised that Brexit increases the risk that dissidents and criminals may seek to undermine peace on the island and engage in criminal activities on a cross border basis.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for operational matters including the distribution of personnel, which is kept under review in line with operational and security demands.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been preparing for Brexit with a wide-ranging focus to determine operational requirements, including personnel, infrastructure, training and technology and continue to progress their contingency preparations. The Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will have the resources required to keep our people and our communities safe. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner was provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019 bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion.  This substantial investment will allow the accelerated Garda recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility, including in Border Divisions. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner intends to recruit 600 trainee Garda&iacute; and 600 Garda Staff (civilians) in 2019 and the recruitment of these additional Garda staff will facilitate the redeployment this year of 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline duties for which they are trained.  As part of the ongoing increase in Garda resources, the Commissioner has deployed a number of additional Garda&iacute; to border counties in recent months and this will continue. </p>  <p>  In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can be provided through normal deployment.  These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management and detailed consideration given in due course to the medium to long-term implications. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-border crime.  The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p></reply>

I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and other emergency services, consider the use of Eircodes to be of vital assistance in locating the position of emergency callers, particularly in rural areas where non unique addresses can be a significant issue.</p>  <p>  Eircodes can assist on a practical level with preventing crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na encourage the marking of property as a crime prevention measure. Where this is done in communities, signs can be erected in the area indicating that property has been marked. This, in itself, acts as a significant deterrent to criminals and has, I understand, had very positive effects on crime rates. </p>  <p>  While neither my Department nor An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na endorse any particular property marking product or service provider, the act of marking the property, be that with an ultra violet pen or an embossing machine, acts as a deterrent and makes it more difficult for criminals to profit, . </p>  <p>  Marking property with an Eircode has a number of distinct advantages. Aside from reducing the likelihood that your property will be stolen in the first place, it can assist Garda&iacute; in identifying stolen property that a person may have in their possession and provides evidence for prosecutions. It also allows for identification of the rightful owner and the return of property quickly and efficiently. </p>  <p>  I am informed that highly successful pilot projects involving the marking of property with eircodes have been carried out in West Cork and Monaghan and are being adopted by communities elsewhere in the country.  While supported by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, these initiatives have been successfully adopted by the local communities involved.    </p>  <p>  Whatever method is used, I would strongly encourage people to mark their property be it farm machinery, bicycles, computers or other personal property and to consider the advantages of using a unique identifier - such as eircode - in doing so.  </p></reply>

These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres. As of the end of May 2019 2,395 residents across 11 centres have access to a Food Hall and cooking facilities operating under the Agency&rsquo;s Independent Living Model.  Independent Living is a system where residents can obtain food, toiletries and other products for personal use from a dedicated Food Hall in the centre using a cashless points system.  The residents then cook any food purchased in the cooking facilities available in the centre. An additional ten other centres offer cooking facilities to a further 1,416 residents, but the residents must provide the food themselves.  At present, 3,811 residents, or 57% of persons availing of accommodation, have access to cooking facilities and are no longer under the Direct Provision model as originally developed and further progress will be made in this area this year.   </p>  <p>   In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.</p>  <p>   In order to meet the accommodation needs in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons in the protection process, by way of the independent living model, are being advertised. This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is due for completion in 2020. This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State. Under this competition, all successful bids must provide residents with the option of preparing their own meals as part of their proposal.</p>  <p>   In addition, all successful bidders under the tender process must provide designated living room space for families only to allow them to carry out the normal experience of family life outside of their sleeping quarters and provide as part of their bid an implementation plan to meet the social care needs of residents.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the public procurement process which will see all commercially owned accommodation centres provide independent living, my Department is also in discussions with the Office of Public Works to progress the introduction of independent living in the state owned centres at Knockalisheen, Co. Clare, Kinsale Road, Cork, Atlas House and Johnston Marina in Tralee, Co. Kerry and Atlas House and Park Lodge in Killarney, Co. Kerry. Independent Living has already been implemented in the remaining state owned centre in Athlone, Co. Westmeath.</p>  <p>  Following the McMahon Report, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of that Report and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State. The Standards will meet the standards set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions.  Operational Standards and Indicators will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process. They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.  The timeline for implementation of the Standards is by January 2021.</p>  <p>  When allied with significant changes to the time taken by applicants in the international protection process and these improvements, such as granting access to the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, when fully implemented, I wish to assure the Deputy that the Department is putting in place a number of measures which will substantially improve the experiences of those using our accommodation centres.  </p></reply>

We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 30 April 2019, the total Garda strength was approximately 14,000. As of the same date, there were approximately 2,650 Garda Staff employed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertaking a range of administrative and technical duties in the organisation.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has further informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and 600 Garda Civilian Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to a vigorous and comprehensive response to burglary, theft and other property-related crime. Both urban and rural communities across the country will benefit from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government and the concentrated anti-crime drive coordinated under Operation Thor. The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime under Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity. As of 7 May 2019, almost 201,000 targeted checkpoints and 356,400 crime prevention patrols have been conducted nationwide. To give you an idea of the impact of the Operation, I can inform you that this concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 10,000 arrests and 11,600 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. </p>  <p>  Operation Hybrid has been established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address public safety concerns about community safety and benefits from significant support by Armed Support Units. The robust Garda response to the series of shootings perpetrated by violent criminals in Dublin has, as of 5 May 2019, seen 76,699 high visibility checkpoints implemented. In addition, a number of arrests have been made and weapons seized during the Operation.</p>  <p>  I believe that the injection of a large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities and I want to reassure you that criminal gangs that target all areas of the country and prey on communities, both urban and rural, are continuously monitored and relentlessly targeted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

This has seen an increase in the number of Garda members to just over 14,000 at the end of 2018, a net increase of over 1,000 since the end of 2016.

This operation consists of high visibility patrols and checkpoints, days of action and covert policing initiatives, targeting specific parties to the feud. Extra resources have also been assigned to the area with 30 recruits being assigned to the Louth area from the most recent Garda attestation on the 7 June. </p>  <p>  Kildare has also seen a significant increase in the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division. Excluding the DMR, Louth and Kildare have been assigned the largest number of recruits since the reopening of the Garda college with 136 and 118 respectively. Kildare, as a Dublin hinterland, has seen the largest increase in its workforce since 2009 with 74 more Garda&iacute; since 2009.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.   </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving such as reflecting the need to respond to changing international circumstances and also to ongoing service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and work practices. </p>  <p>  In general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The average processing time from the date an application was received to the date a decision was made was 6.7 months in 2016, 7.2 months in 2017 and 6.5 months in 2018. Additional checks with state agencies which in turn may require liaison with counterparts in other jurisdictions can result in some applications taking longer than this average timescale. These checks are fundamental to maintain the legitimacy of the naturalisation process both nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  As of the end of May 2019, there were 12,500 applications on hand. To date this year a total of 2,348 adults and 638 minors have been naturalised while a further 680 adults are due to attend a citizenship ceremony in Waterford this coming Friday. </p>  <p>  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process. Each citizenship application is unique and is assessed on its merits according to the administrative and legislative conditions in place at the time of application </p>  <p>  INIS devotes considerable resources to the processing of these applications. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie  </p></reply>

Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with 346 of those assigned to the border region.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the strength of the Northern Region as of 30 April 2019, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 1,452 Garda&iacute;. There are 57 Garda Reserves and 153 Garda civilian staff attached to the Northern Region.  An additional 50 Garda&iacute; were assigned to the region with effect from 7 June 2019.</p>  <p>  The increased resources coming on stream have provided the Commissioner with the capacity to expand the resources available to the specialist bureaus that come within the ambit of Special Crime Operations including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau all of which are particularly active in the Northern Region.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner has been provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019 bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion. This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue at the same time as new and leading edge technology is deployed to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians). The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline duties for which they are trained. I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. </p>  <p>  This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service. As part of this ongoing increase in Garda resources, the Commissioner has deployed a number of additional Garda&iacute; to border counties in recent months and this will continue. </p>  <p>  In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, further resources can be provided through normal deployment. These requirements will be kept under ongoing review by Garda management with a view to addressing any policing requirements for the Border region which may arise depending upon the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combating security threats and cross-border crime. The Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combating crime, protecting community safety and saving lives. The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide the necessary resources to keep our people and our communities safe.</p></reply>

They were prepared by a Standards Advisory Group, established in 2017 and comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion as well as representatives from AkiDwA, Children's Rights Alliance, the Core Group of Asylum Seekers and Refugees, the Jesuit Refugee Service, SPIRASI, and the UNHCR. The Standards address a range of themes including accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State, food and catering, individual, community and family life, health and wellbeing, governance and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  They therefore build on the work done in the 2015 McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the Recast Reception Directive.</p>  <p>  The standards went out for public consultation last year which included dedicated information workshops at a number of accommodation centres.   </p>  <p>  It is planned to launch the standards next month.  The current procurement process in respect of direct provision accommodation was designed with a view to ensuring that all direct provision accommodation will adhere to these standards, when they come into force on January 2021.</p></reply>

There is ongoing communication between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the respective control centres, and access to good quality CCTV can assist the Garda&iacute; when investigating serious incidents.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I welcome Irish Rail's plan to install more CCTV cameras and increase security patrols on DART carriages over the coming months, which is a positive step.  I also support the introduction of a text alert system which was announced by Irish Rail recently. This service will facilitate customers to discreetly report any incidents as they develop on rail services.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already employ a wide range of operational measures aimed at tackling public-order offences and anti-social behaviour. These measures are underpinned by the existence of a comprehensive legal framework, which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime, including provisions under:</p>  <p>  - the Criminal Damage Act 1991;</p>  <p>  - Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994;</p>  <p>  - the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and</p>  <p>  - the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p>  <p>  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. The Commissioner has informed me that he plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and, in addition, it is his intention to recruit a net 600 Garda Civilian Staff. This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019.</p>  <p>  The provision of these additional resources to the Commissioner is a key component in this Government's approach to improving public safety throughout the country which will undoubtedly also benefit policing of transport services in Dublin and in other areas. </p></reply>

These courts will have new procedures aimed at less adversarial resolution of disputes and will have appropriate facilities and case management arrangements. </p>  <p>  A working group was established in 2017, comprising officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board, to examine the operational aspects relating to the family court and develop an overall architecture for the new family court structure. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla also participated in the working group. Key issues that arose in consultations included family court venues and facilities, resources and capital investment in family courts and integration of relevant family and child services to provide the best possible family law outcomes. </p>  <p>  In 2018, a task force on the Family Court comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service was formed to seek agreement on core questions of policy and costs.  A representative of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has also joined the group. The work of this group is at an advanced stage. Issues being examined include court areas and locations, use of courthouses, provision of facilities and services, arrangements for management of resources, and oversight arrangements. </p>  <p>  Work is well advanced on the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill. When finalised, the General Scheme will be submitted for Government approval in the usual manner and will have to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It is not possible at this stage to estimate when the Bill will be ready for publication. </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill is only one component of a new Family Court system. The provision of appropriate court facilities and services, and the capital and current resources that may be required for this, will be just as important, if not more so, for the operation of a new family court system. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to building a new Family Law Centre and Children&rsquo;s Court in Dublin 7. The Government&rsquo;s Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 provides for development of a Family Law and Children&rsquo;s Court at the Hammond Lane site. The project is to be delivered as a Public Private Partnership. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998 management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. </p>  <p>  My officials have been in ongoing discussions with the Courts Service who have been advised that &euro;80 million in capital funding has been made available for the project.</p></reply>

An allocation of &euro;1.76 billion has been made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019 and very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p><p>In relation to the Garda estate, the Deputy will be aware that the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is based on agreed Garda priorities. It continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by significant Exchequer funding across the Garda and OPW Votes.  In addition to that programme, other major works to the Garda estate which are ongoing include the pilot Garda station reopening project, the development of a new facility at Military Road and the major refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street station. The goal of this ongoing investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff, as well as the public interacting with them.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. Accordingly, replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of Garda stations in Cork are included in these planned or ongoing works to the Garda estate. </p><p>First, the development of a new station in Glanmire, which will be located in Glanmire Industrial Estate, is included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme. The construction of this station is ongoing and the Garda authorities and OPW advise that completion is expected in Q3, 2019. </p><p>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in order to facilitate the Divisional Policing Model in Cork City, the Cork City Divisional Roads Policing Unit is relocating from Anglesea Street to Ballincollig Garda Station, and that works to accommodate the Divisional Roads Policing Unit in Ballincollig Garda Station are scheduled for this year.</p><p>A new station in Macroom is also included in the programme, with delivery of that station along with new stations in Clonmel and Sligo to be achieved as part of a Public Private Partnership (PPP)<b></b>arrangement. It is not possible at this point to provide a timeframe for completion of these projects.  However I can assure the Deputy that delivery of these new stations through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p><p>A station in Cork is also included in the pilot Garda station reopening project.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations to determine possible positive impacts on criminal activity. The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommended that Ballinspittle Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Bawnboy, Co. Cavan, Leighlinbridge, Co. Carlow, Donard, Co. Wicklow, and Rush and Stepaside, Co. Dublin. The OPW and Garda authorities are cooperating closely on this project. In relation to Ballinspittle, I am informed the OPW has undertaken technical surveys to determine the works required to enable the Garda Station at Ballinspittle to reopen and is preparing tender documents to procure the required works. I am informed that it is envisaged works will be completed this year. </p><p>Finally and more generally, I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in consultation with the OPW seeks to address minor maintenance issues and refurbishment works across all Divisions as they arise, having regard to overall Garda accommodation priorities.</p></reply>

It is the national reporting service for illegal online content. It deals primarily with child sexual abuse material as defined in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 as amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and its takedown in line with the provisions of EU Directive 2011/93 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. It also takes reports concerning other illegal online content such as racism as covered by the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. Its remit does not extend to content which may be considered harmful but is not illegal. </p><p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment deals with the wider issue of online harms that are not illegal. That Department held a public consultation which was open until April 2019. It sought the views of citizens and stakeholders as to an achievable, proportionate and effective approach to regulating harmful content, particularly online. I understand that a significant number of submissions were received during the consultation period including one from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I further understand the submissions are currently being considered by DCCAE in developing policy in this area and that the monitoring and take down of online content which is harmful will be considered as part of this process. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, harassment is already an offence under Section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The 2016 Law Reform Commission Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety identified a number of areas for reform in criminal legislation, including harassment.  </p><p>The Deputy will also be conscious of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 which is a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill sponsored by Deputy Brendan Howlin. The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications.  </p><p>The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications to or about a person. The Bill will criminalise the distribution of intimate images without consent that causes harm, commonly known as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;.  </p><p>Following the agreement by Cabinet to support and amend the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, my officials engaged in extensive consultations with the sponsor of the Bill and the Office of the Attorney General to prepare draft amendments. These amendments were approved by Government on 1 May 2019 and have now been sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to be formally drafted before they can be introduced at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.<b></b></p><p>The amendments will ensure consistency in the provisions of the Bill overall. In relation to criminal offences, they will introduce a distinct offence of stalking in Ireland for the first time. They will provide for two separate image-based offences to deal with the phenomena of &ldquo;upskirting&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;. The amendments will also remove some of the civil provisions in the Bill that may be more appropriately dealt with through proposals to establish the Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner or a Regulator. These matters are, as I have said, currently being examined by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></reply>

I can, however, provide some general advice in relation to establishing eligibility to hold an Irish passport. </p>  <p>  All passport applications are subject to the provisions of the Passports Act 2008. The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him or her. In order to meet this requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship by providing acceptable documentary evidence of this entitlement. </p>  <p>  Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation.</p>  <p>  An individual born on the island of Ireland before 2005 is automatically an Irish citizen. For individuals born outside of Ireland, they may claim citizenship if they had at least one parent who was born in the island of Ireland before 2005. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service would be happy to provide further information and guidance to the person in question. The Passport Service operates a Customer Service Centre which provides information via telephone and webchat. The telephone number for the Customer Service Centre is 01 671 1633 and webchat can be accessed through the passport service's website.

It has always been our hope that the future relationship agreement between the EU and UK would resolve the border issue. However, should this not prove possible, a hard border would be avoided through the backstop mechanism set out in the Withdrawal Agreement. This insurance policy is vital for protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.</p><p>The EU has made clear its commitment to looking at alternative arrangements as part of the negotiations on the future relationship. These discussions can only begin once the Withdrawal Agreement enters into effect . This is clearly set out in the <i>Political Declaration setting out the Framework for the Future Relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom</i>, as well as in the <i>Instrument relating to the Agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU</i>and <i>Joint Statement supplementing the Political Declaration</i>agreed between President Juncker and Prime Minister May in Strasbourg on 11 March.</p><p>In this context, the Government welcomes the UK Government's announcement that it is to establish working groups to examine alternative arrangements in order to prepare for that future negotiation. It is good that the UK is seeking to hear from a broad range of opinion, including from key stakeholders in Northern Ireland who have lived experiences of the invisible border on the island of Ireland.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge, however, that both the EU and the UK Government agree that no one has yet come up with arrangements which could replace those set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, which avoid a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, protecting the all-island economy, North-South cooperation and the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>Any future agreement must ensure the same outcome as the backstop.  In accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the EU and the UK must agree jointly if arrangements, whether technological or not, under any future agreement deliver this outcome so that the backstop can be avoided or is no longer required in whole or in part. As co-guarantors, the Irish and British Governments will continue to have our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland and any proposal must reflect this. </p></reply>

Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability, and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 &lsquo;Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 &lsquo;Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters&rsquo;) to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: </p>  <p>  1. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p>  2. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65% to 100%, and  the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100% funding over the next number of years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, has prepared a public consultation paper on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020. This consultation, which has now been published on the Department of Finance website, is open to all persons and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to submit feedback.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance I have reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and that since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo).</p></reply>

Where share options are exercised, and the shares subsequently sold, the taxpayers involved will be subject to Capital Gains Tax on the disposal.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.126.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600075#WRC03400"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or businesses.</p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge the general problems faced by many consumers, businesses, community and voluntary groups, in relation to the cost and availability of insurance.  I also appreciate that there is some frustration about the perceived pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.</p>  <p>  However, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government.  As the Deputy is aware, the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  The Deputy will recall that the CIWG has produced two reports since its inception and has been working to implement the 33 recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report published in 2017, as well as the 15 Recommendations of the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report, published in 2018.  Achievements to date include the following: </p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;</p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; </p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p>  <p>  - the commencement by the Law Reform Commission of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;  </p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.  </p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.</p>  <p>  While the Working Group will continue to focus on implementing all of its recommendations, I consider that bringing the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions is undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs.  The Deputy will recall that the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.   In this regard, relevant amendments were agreed to the Judicial Council Bill at Report Stage in the Seanad last week and I am pleased that the Bill subsequently completed its consideration by the Seanad.  This is a significant step and both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy are hopeful that the Bill can now complete its consideration by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the coming weeks and be enacted before the summer recess.</p>  <p>  Finally, as I have stated previously, if there is a recalibration of award levels downwards, I would expect the insurance industry to take account of such reductions in their pricing.  As you will recall, Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  I would also add that I believe this is not just an issue of lowering the price of insurance, but of increasing cover to areas that the insurers are not providing cover too, thereby broadening their risk horizon.  Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has met with Insurance Ireland on the issue.  He will also meet with representatives from individual insurance companies on the issue in the coming weeks to reiterate this expectation and to seek commitments.  While this is something the Government will continue to pursue, the Oireachtas also can play an important role and in that regard I am happy that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach intends to invite insurance companies to speak to it and seek a commitment in relation to pricing should award levels be reduced.</p></reply>

Funding was provided by the Office of Public Works to Limerick City and County Council for the construction of sheet piling behind an embankment, completed in 2014, and for advance works on Verdant Place, which consisted of repointing the existing stone wall and construction of reinforced concrete wall to the rear.

Limerick, was one of 300 areas believed to be at significant flood risk nationally, and hence assessed as part of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest ever flood risk study carried out in the State.  The CFRAM Programme culminated with the launch of 29 Flood Risk Management Plans on 3 May 2018, and proposed 118 new outline flood relief projects on top of the 42 major projects already completed and the 33 major schemes within the existing capital works programme of the Office of Public Works (OPW). </p>  <p>  All of these projects are to be funded under the Government's 10 year flood risk investment programme of almost &euro;1 billion under the National Development Plan 2018 &ndash; 2027.  </p>  <p>  As it is not possible to progress all 118 proposed new schemes at once, funding of &euro;257 million was also announced for an initial phase of 50 flood relief projects throughout the country, to be progressed to detailed design and construction; including the five largest schemes identified in the Plans and 31 small, or minor projects (with an estimated preliminary project budget of under &euro;1 million), which will be progressed directly by Local Authorities.  The proposed flood relief scheme in Castleconnell is included in the 31 small projects under &euro;1 million, and is being progressed directly by Limerick City and County Council with full funding from the OPW.  </p>  <p>  Potentially viable flood relief works for Castleconnell (to be implemented subject to project-level assessment) are likely to include construction of a new flood defence wall, embankment and floodgates, and raising roads in key locations, along with maintaining the existing flood forecasting and public awareness campaign operated by the ESB. The flood protection measures identified under the CFRAM programme are to an outline design, and are not at this point ready for construction. Further detailed design, including a review of costs and benefits, environmental assessment, and consultation will be required for such works before implementation.  Therefore, the exact location in Castleconnell at which the defences will be built will be determined through detailed design and project level assessment.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, Limerick City and County Council invited tenders for Engineering and Environmental Consultants for this project in January 2019.  A preferred tenderer was identified and has now been appointed to progress this scheme. The preferred option identified under the CFRAM programme has an estimated preliminary project cost of &euro;720,000.  This is a pre-tender estimate and may change following the design and procurement processes, and will be subject to market conditions at the time of tender.</p></reply>

These meetings gave me the opportunity to hear the challenges facing these teachers and also gave them a chance to offer practical solutions to some issues. </p>  <p>  The meetings allowed me in my role as Minister, to meet with these teachers and discuss first hand with them the challenges they face in returning to Ireland, and to consider ways that we can work together, to support them, when and if they decide to return to work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  To facilitate this, teachers volunteered to form a group to liaise on the identified issues with the embassy and my Department. Arrangements are being made for the first meeting of this group in the autumn.</p>  <p>  During my visit I also had a number of productive meetings which will further develop and enhance the cooperation that presently exists between Ireland and the UAE in the Higher Education area.</p>  <p>  The Irish education system plays a key role in forging crucial global relationships and building international outlook and awareness. One of the core ambitions of my Government&rsquo;s International Education Strategy, &lsquo;Irish Educated, Globally Connected&rsquo; is to support the development of internationally-oriented, globally competitive institutions and this visit has assisted us in delivering on this ambition.</p>  <p>  I met with my counterpart the UAE Minister for Education H.E. Hussain Bin Ibrahim Al Hammadi, where we discussed some of the mutual common challenges that we face in our respective education systems and agreed that we will work together through the exchange of information and through collaboration to address these challenges.</p>  <p>  I also visited a number of UAE Higher education Institutions such as Khalifa University and the City University College of Ajman (CUCA) where I had the opportunity to promote the Irish Higher Education Sector and had very fruitful discussions on how to increase the level of Academic, Research, Staff and student exchange between Higher Education Institutions in both Countries.</p>  <p>  While in Dubai I attend a business breakfast of the Irish business Network to highlight possibilities of partnerships between Irish and UAE educational institutions and to meet with key Irish business community members. </p>  <p>  I also visited RCSI and Mohamed Bin Rashid University in the Mohamed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Centre. RCSI are present in Dubai since 2005 offering post graduate education, training and consultancy in leadership, management, patient safety and quality. A strong connection already exists through the RCSI Alumni network and my visit was to strengthen this relationship as Minister for Education and Skills in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I want to thank the Irish ambassador and his staff in the Embassy, the local Irish groups, including the GAA, and the Irish living in the UAE for the work they did to make this visit a success.</p></reply>

It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college. The student grant scheme does however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. </p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years. Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p></reply>

Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has informed my Department that they intend to establish approx. 156 new ASD special classes nationally for 2019/20 school year to meet currently identified need.</p><p>The NCSE has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE). </p><p>This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. </p><p>In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE take account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned.  </p><p>The NCSE ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes.  It is open to any school to make application to the National Council for Special education (NCSE) to establish a special class.  </p><p>When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class and/or to construct additional accommodation.  </p><p>Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.</p><p>The new power to compel schools to make additional special education provision available has yet to be invoked.  </p><p>While the NCSE and the Department continue to encourage stakeholders to open special classes, the process under the admissions legislation will continue and may lead to interaction with education providers entering a more formal process. </p><p>The NCSE is currently undertaking Policy Advice on Education Provision in Special Classes and Special Schools to examine whether placement in specialist settings brings about improved educational outcomes and experiences, relative to their ability, for students with special educational needs. This Policy Advice is to be completed and a report submitted to the Minister no later than June 2020.</p><p>Parents who need assistance/advice or who are experiencing difficulties in locating a specialised placement, should contact their local SENO.

This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  These new schools will reduce pressure on schools in the adjacent school planning areas, including the Dublin 8 and 12 areas. I understand that the existing schools in the Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 school planning areas have capacity to accommodate demand in the area at present.</p>  <p>   The Deputy may wish to note that the patronage model of the post-primary schools due to open in 2020 and 2021 has not yet been decided. Patronage processes for the new schools will be undertaken in advance of their opening and will be open to all patron bodies.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that City of Dublin ETB and Educate Together have been working together in relation to extending the co-educational and multi-denominational educational provision at second level schools in Dublin 12 and Dublin 7.  I understand that significant progress has been made in this regard and work is planned to continue over the summer period. I am supportive of this initiative which has the potential to add to and enhance the availability of additional choice in these areas and my Department is engaging with the bodies concerned in this regard. This initiative represents an opportunity to increase diversity of provision in existing schools in areas where a new school is not required.</p></reply>

This percentage figure is significantly higher for Irish passengers and passengers of other EU nationalities.  This data is provided by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) who monitor overall passenger movements through the airport.  </p>  <p>  This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with over 31.5 million passengers using the airport. Throughput times compares very favourably with airports in other similar jurisdictions.  The number of complaints received directly by INIS in relation to delays is extremely small considering the overall volume of passengers per annum.   </p>  <p>  To cater for the increase in numbers, additional Immigration Officers have been recruited for Dublin Airport and the allocation of personnel is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during the peak periods so that all available immigration booths are operational at these times. Every effort is made by Immigration Officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible, consistent with the requirement to protect Irish borders and facilitate the movement of legitimate passengers.</p>  <p>  In addition, automatic border control &lsquo;eGates&rsquo; have been operational at Dublin Airport since November 2017.  Over 2.5 million passengers availed of the eGates in 2018, including 1.3 million Irish passport holders. So far in 2019, over 700,000 passengers have availed of the eGates.  The eGates in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 have recently been upgraded to facilitate speedier processing and passengers with Irish passport cards can now avail of them. </p>  <p>  However, as with all major airports, specific pressure points can arise, often outside of the control of the immigration authorities, that can lengthen the time it takes for passengers to be processed.  For example, this arises when a very high number of flights arrive within a specific time period, with consequent increases to passenger numbers during these peak times.  This situation can be compounded when, in addition to scheduled arrivals, delayed flights also land during these peak periods. </p>  <p>  While the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights, their scheduling or actual arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the DAA and with air carriers. All parties work closely together across a number of fronts to address capacity and queue management where they arise to alleviate congestion, to maximise passenger throughput, and ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum.  </p></reply>

If further documentation is required it will be requested from the applicant in due course.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time, which may be outside the direct control of INIS. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The offence was created in order to safeguard the lives of individuals who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable or at risk of abuse. Prosecution of the offence, which can result in a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years, is at the sole discretion of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</p><p>The constitutionality of the legislation was upheld by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Fleming v Ireland and Others delivered on 29 April 2013. While acknowledging the very distressing situation of Ms. Fleming, the Court held that there is no constitutional right to commit suicide or to arrange for the ending of one&rsquo;s life at a time of one&rsquo;s choosing.  The Court also found that the prohibition on assisted suicide was not discriminatory and was not contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. As a consequence of the judgment, the offence of assisting another to take his or her life remains in place.  </p><p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in June 2018, published a Report on the Right to Die with Dignity. The Committee reported that, in the course of its hearings, it did not achieve a clear consensus as to whether legislative change was justified and that it was not, therefore, in a position to recommend legislative change at that time. The Irish Association for Palliative Care appeared before the Committee and also expressed the view that there should be no change in the law to allow assisted suicide or euthanasia and set out its reasoning in that regard. </p><p>Assisted suicide is a very complex issue which gives rise not only to criminal justice issues but also to constitutional, medical, ethical and moral issues. The competing interests of the individual would have to be balanced with the wider public interest in safeguarding persons who are nearing the end of their lives and who might be vulnerable and at risk of abuse. As such, the Minister has no plans to review the existing legislation.</p><p>The Committee made a number of recommendations, including that the Houses of the Oireachtas consider referring the issue to the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly for deliberation.  </p></reply>

I have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of the Authority.  My Department has an annual governance oversight agreement with the Authority which, inter alia, sets out key objectives and targets to be achieved on an annual basis.</p><p>The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) sets out the security services licensable by the Authority. The Authority licences both contractors and employees in the security industry and licensing is being introduced on a phased basis to the security industry.  One of the security services prescribed in the legislation is that of door supervisor. The door supervisor sector is licensable under a number of sub-categories, one of which is &lsquo;Licensed Premises&rsquo;.</p><p>Licensing of contractors in the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) sector commenced on 19 December 2005 and in the Door Supervisor (Event Security) sector on 1 November 2014. Employee licensing for the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) sector commenced on 1 September 2006. Licensing of employees in the Door Supervisor (Event Security) sector has not yet commenced. All employees seeking a licence in the Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) sector must obtain the prescribed qualification Guarding Skills QQI Level 4 Minor Award or Door Security Procedures QQI Level 4 Minor Award or an equivalent qualification.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that contractors in these sectors must adhere to the PSA Licensing Requirements Document &ndash; PSA 28:2013 Door Supervision and Security Guarding and PSA Licensing Requirements Document &ndash; PSA 39:2014 Event Security respectively. As part of the licensing regime contractors are audited annually to these Requirements Documents by an auditing body approved by the PSA. Part of such audits is verifying that contractors have the necessary protocols and supervisory checks for their individual operatives.</p><p>The Private Security Authority have 5 regional Inspectors.  These Inspectors, amongst other inspection duties, carry out unannounced checks on licensed premises throughout the country to ensure that individuals in the Door Supervisor (licensed premises) are properly licensed. The Inspectors also undertake inspections of contractors to ensure compliance with the relevant Requirements Documents.</p><p>All new applicants for contractor and employee licences are vetted by the National Vetting Bureau in relation to their suitability to hold a PSA licence and existing licence holders are re-vetted periodically.</p><p>I am advised that work on the licensing of employees in the Door Supervisor (Event Security) sector is underway. A public consultation on the licensing requirements which should apply to the sector was undertaken in August 2018. The Authority expect to announce further details on the licensing of the sector in the coming months.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the licensing decisions made by the Authority are subject to appeal by the Private Security Appeal Board under Section 40 of the Private Security Services Act, 2004 (as amended).</p><p>The attached table shows a breakdown of Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) licences granted by county and by year.</p><p><b>Door Supervisor (Licensed Premises) licences granted by county and by year</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th><th>2019 (up to 21/06/2019)</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>131</td><td>126</td><td>132</td><td>128</td><td>166</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>125</td><td>142</td><td>140</td><td>150</td><td>175</td><td>89</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>202</td><td>201</td><td>212</td><td>227</td><td>263</td><td>153</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>1206</td><td>1260</td><td>1250</td><td>1237</td><td>1498</td><td>777</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>258</td><td>263</td><td>270</td><td>291</td><td>343</td><td>121</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>3922</td><td>3735</td><td>3551</td><td>3759</td><td>4619</td><td>3788</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>748</td><td>750</td><td>699</td><td>742</td><td>909</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>289</td><td>340</td><td>364</td><td>373</td><td>443</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>426</td><td>435</td><td>453</td><td>506</td><td>603</td><td>459</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>145</td><td>139</td><td>127</td><td>129</td><td>163</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>194</td><td>218</td><td>221</td><td>229</td><td>300</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>73</td><td>74</td><td>68</td><td>87</td><td>106</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>428</td><td>457</td><td>493</td><td>506</td><td>627</td><td>410</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>110</td><td>107</td><td>132</td><td>166</td><td>203</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>307</td><td>300</td><td>320</td><td>359</td><td>463</td><td>285</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>312</td><td>311</td><td>322</td><td>285</td><td>334</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>333</td><td>340</td><td>354</td><td>368</td><td>430</td><td>317</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>158</td><td>162</td><td>152</td><td>135</td><td>155</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>186</td><td>179</td><td>178</td><td>175</td><td>218</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>117</td><td>126</td><td>125</td><td>133</td><td>166</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>143</td><td>146</td><td>154</td><td>158</td><td>197</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>267</td><td>287</td><td>275</td><td>296</td><td>355</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>227</td><td>265</td><td>298</td><td>338</td><td>431</td><td>195</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>161</td><td>165</td><td>180</td><td>234</td><td>288</td><td>162</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>234</td><td>261</td><td>290</td><td>328</td><td>395</td><td>168</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>225</td><td>239</td><td>232</td><td>229</td><td>287</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>Northern Ireland</td><td>61</td><td>59</td><td>65</td><td>80</td><td>88</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>GB (excl.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities. </p>  <p>  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies to target, dismantle and disrupt organised criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. It is important to note that Garda&iacute;, supported by the significant resources allocated to it by this Government, have made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime. The resources available to the Commissioner have reached unprecedented levels and I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this with an increase of &euro;110 million in the Garda Vote to bring total provision available in 2019 to &euro;1.76 billion which includes up to &euro;95 million for the payment of overtime.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau was established as a national multi-disciplinary agency specialising in targeting the proceeds of crime. The Bureau draws together the necessary expertise from a number of Departments and agencies. The Bureau has for some considerable time maintained a presence in each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme. Under this Programme asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime. The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which enables it to target the proceeds of crime in local communities. I can inform the Deputy that a number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles. These new resources coming on stream have allowed the Commissioner to allocate additional resources to the specialist bureaus that comprise Garda Special Crime Operations including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  The Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT which is now an important element of the fight against organised crime.  This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in their daily work in tackling the scourge of organised crime in our communities.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I remain in close contact with the Commissioner to ensure that the necessary resources are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to robustly confront and tackle those involved in organised criminal acts.</p></reply>

This is a positive development and delivers on the target set out under 'A Policing Service for the Future', the implementation plan for the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p><p>The Commissioner has this year been provided with an additional &euro;100 million bringing his budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion, which includes provision for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; this year. The Commissioner plans to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 and a net 600 Garda Staff.  This Garda Staff recruitment will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing in 2019. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

I have asked the CSO to forward any available statistics in relation to the information requested directly to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  However, I understand that due to changes to the PULSE system implemented during 2018 in respect of how offenders are recorded, bail figures for 2018 are not directly comparable with previous years. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against  crimes committed by persons on bail. </p>  <p>  Under the Act, a Court, in considering an application for bail, is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the grant of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more. The Court will also have the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken.</p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increases the use of curfews, and, where requested by Garda&iacute;, allows for the introduction of electronic tagging for those on bail in certain circumstances.</p></reply>

This compares favourably with 3,130 or 21.7% of the total strength on 31 December 2008.  While this is broadly in line with other police services in England and Wales, there is clearly plenty of scope for improvement.</p><p>In the course of its work the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI) held semi-structured focus group discussions with female Garda members to explore the experiences of female Garda personnel regarding their careers, training and development and future prospects. Among the recommendations made in the CoFPI report, which the Government adopted in December 2018, is the reform of the current roster and greater flexibility of work practices which would enhance the attractiveness and job satisfaction of a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>In addition, the report also recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socio-economic, educational and geographical backgrounds and that they would need to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is developing a Garda Diversity and Inclusion Strategy which is at an advanced stage and recognises the importance of recruiting from a wide cross-section of the population so that the organisation provides a policing service that reflects the growing diversity of Irish society. </p><p>A concerted effort is being made to encourage women and minority communities to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that its membership reflects the community that it serves. Recent recruitment campaigns have made a significant effort through on-line videos and other media to attract candidates from minority communities and diverse social groups.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is unlikely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation has traditionally had.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid, with shifting memberships and alliances. New splinter groups and new gangs can form overnight. </p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty up to life imprisonment. </p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence. </p>  <p>  In recent years a number of other legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;, in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in particular the Criminal Assets Bureau are already making use of these provisions. </p>  <p>  Overall I believe that sufficient legislation already exists for the prosecution of offences relating to organised crime and to target the proceeds of crime and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has both the determination and the resources to tackle gangland violence in our communities.</p></reply>

For example, the Act requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services, therefore, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising therefrom, has involved examining and taking account of policing best practice internationally. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that one of the functions of the Garda Professional Standards Unit, is to promote the highest standards of practice, as measured by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. The Unit undertakes reviews, as directed by the Garda Commissioner, into operational, administrative and management matters relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels. Arising from these reviews, measures to improve performance and promote the highest standards of practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are proposed. The Garda Commissioner draws on the Unit's proposals to enhance policing practices and policies.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing recommended a move towards a new district or local model for community policing, where all police personnel, sworn and unsworn, are to be considered to be community police. All personnel will be part of a single district policing team working to keep communities safe, and all should see their overarching collective function as solving problems affecting community safety in their district. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on 18 December 2018 the Government endorsed the report of the Commission and agreed to accept all 157 key recommendations contained in the report, including in relation to a new policing model. Garda management are currently developing the new model of community policing based on delivering localised policing services to meet the differing needs of different communities. Most importantly, local frontline policing will be placed at the core of our policing service, ensuring that Garda&iacute; are more active and visible in communities. Under A Policing Service for the Future, the high level implementation plan giving effect to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been piloting the new local policing model in four Divisions - Mayo, Galway, Cork and DMR South - since February.

It is imperative that Garda&iacute; are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it would not be appropriate for me to detail the operational measures that the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in situations where individual Garda&iacute; are subject to threats or intimidation. However, I can assure the Deputy that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken.</p>  <p>  I should also say that while the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against Garda&iacute;.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) provides explicit statutory protection for peace officers, including members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in relation to offences involving assault to or obstruction of a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty. Section 19 of that Act provides that any person who assaults a peace officer acting in the execution of his or her duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years. </p>  <p>  The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties. The assault and related provisions in that Act apply to assaults on all sectors of our community which of course includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

They made a number of recommendations to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework in relation to harmful digital communications.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, my primary responsibilities in this area relate to the development of effective criminal law responses to these issues.  Any such responses must tackle behaviour that is illegal, whether online or offline. It is important to remember that many forms of harmful online content and behaviours, including cyber-bullying, are not necessarily criminal in nature.  There is a general consensus that the appropriate response to addressing such online issues is one that encompasses educational and awareness raising campaigns, as well as effective actions and policies on the part of internet companies.</p>  <p>  In relation to online harassment, I have been working with Deputy Howlin on the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, a Private Member's Bill that completed second stage in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government.  The main provisions of the Bill as published include extending the existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages to apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications. </p>  <p>  The Bill also proposes extending the existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications to or about a person. The Bill will criminalise the distribution of intimate images without consent that causes harm, commonly known as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  I obtained cabinet approval in May 2018 to support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill to ensure that legislation in this area can be enacted as swiftly as possible. Draft amendments were prepared in my Department, in consultation with the sponsor of the Bill and the Office of the Attorney General, and cabinet approval was given to the drafting of those amendments on the 1st of May 2019. </p>  <p>  The amendments will ensure consistency in the provisions of the Bill overall. In relation to criminal offences, they will introduce a distinct offence of stalking in Ireland for the first time. They will provide for two separate image-based offences to deal with the phenomena of &ldquo;upskirting&rdquo; and &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;. They will remove some of the civil provisions in the Bill that may be more appropriately dealt with through proposals to establish the Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner, currently being examined by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p>  <p>  The amendments have now been sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to be formally drafted before they can be introduced at Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I think this legislation, in conjunction with other Governmental action under the Online Safety Action Plan will strengthen our capacity to tackle online harassment and I am committed to progressing this legislation as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Of the 64 victims of human trafficking identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018, five were minors, or slightly less than 8% of the total. This compares to an average child trafficking rate of 23% across the EU.</p>  <p>  It is important to distinguish between human trafficking involving children, and offences under section 3(2) of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 (as amended by the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008), which criminalises the sexual exploitation of a child. Historically, the overwhelming majority of child victims of offences under trafficking legislation included in Irish statistics are Irish child victims of sexual exploitation, usually carried out for personal gratification rather than commercial gain, and often by someone known to the child. Since 2017 these crimes have been excluded from Ireland's reporting on human trafficking, since they fall outside the internationally agreed definition of trafficking. They continue to be a priority for investigation and prosecution.</p>  <p>  While there have been cases of commercial sexual exploitation involving children, both EEA and non-EEA nationals, these cases are rare. As with all crimes, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are vigilant in their efforts to combat the crime of human trafficking and especially the trafficking of children. </p>  <p>  Ireland has an ongoing programme of actions to combat and raise awareness of the matter. Earlier this month at Dublin Airport, the Border Management Unit of my Department ran a week of action against child trafficking in as part of an EU-wide initiative by Europol.</p></reply>

While neither the Act nor the Regulations specifically address cyber or digital risks to employees, the 2005 Act does contain provisions for securing and improving the safety, health and welfare of all employees.  The Act also covers the risk to employees from workplace bullying which could include by cyber or digital means.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Act applies to employers, employees in all employments and to the self&ndash;employed.  There are a number of specific sections of the Act applicable to all workplace risks. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the 2005 Act covers the general duties of employers.  It requires an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all of his or her employees.  This would include any improper conduct or behaviour at work such as violence, bullying or horseplay.  All employers should have a workplace anti-bullying policy in place. </p>  <p>  Section 13 of the 2005 Act covers employees&rsquo; duties which include a requirement on an employee not to engage in improper conduct or other behaviour that is likely to endanger his or her own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person.  Violence, horseplay and bullying at work would come within the meaning of improper conduct.  Workplace anti-bullying policies rely on the co-operation between employers and employees for their effectiveness. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, prepared and published in 2007 in accordance with Section 60 of the 2005 Act which provides guidelines on arrangements, procedures and guidance generally on tackling workplace bullying, harassment and sexual harassment, is currently being revised jointly by the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  I understand that this revised Code of Practice, due for publication in early 2020, will include workplace bullying and harassment by cyber or digital means.</p></reply>

To become a full member, a country must go through an obligatory &lsquo;associate membership in the pre-stage to membership&rsquo; phase for a minimum of two and maximum of five years. The initial contribution shall be at least 25% of full membership cost, which should increase to 100% by the first year of full membership.  This would mean the cost of membership could go from &euro;3.4m initially to &euro;13.6m during the agreed pre-membership phase.</p>  <p>  Membership costs are calculated based on the Net National Income (NNI) of member states. No one member state can contribute more than 20% of the overall CERN budget.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the annual full membership cost there is a &lsquo;special contribution&rsquo; fee calculated as 1.5 times the cost of the full membership fee.  Based on a cost of &euro;13.6 m this would amount to &euro;17m due on the day a state becomes a full member. There are however options for the payment of this special contribution. It may be paid over a defined period, possibly 10 years, and 20% of this contribution may be paid via &lsquo;in-kind contributions&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, the total initial full membership cost would be &euro;30.6 million comprising the annual full membership fee and the special contribution fee.  It is important to note that it is possible to negotiate on the timing of this payment. </p>  <p>  An associate membership fee of minimum &euro;1.3 million per annum is also possible, this is a 10% associate membership which is the lowest available at CERN. The benefits as well as the costs are restricted with this option.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the position in relation to CERN membership, and its cost, under review and maintains contact with officials in CERN in relation to Ireland's potential membership. </p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, the national strategy for research and innovation, recognises that for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader, our research and innovation system must be open with strong international collaboration links. Membership of leading international research organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement.  </p>  <p>  For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with several international research organisations. Four organisations were identified &ndash; CERN, the European Southern Observatory, ELIXIR and LOFAR - and membership of three of these organisations has been completed. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues its consideration of CERN membership.  </p></reply>

While the Court was established under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, its functions have been altered and extended by subsequent legislation, including, most recently, the Workplace Relations Act 2015. Under the 2015 Act, the Labour Court assumed the role of sole appellate body in disputes under employment rights legislation. </p><p>As of 24 June 2019, the Labour Court has cases in respect of 76 appellants that are ready to be scheduled* for first hearing. A breakdown of waiting times for these 76 appellants is set out in tabular form below.  </p><p><table><tr><th>Waiting Times - Months</th><th>Ready for scheduling *</th></tr><tr><td>1 month or less</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Between 1 and 2 months</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Between 2 and 3 months</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Between 3 and 4 months</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Between 4 and 5 months</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Between 5 and 6 months</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Between 6 and 7 months</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Greater than 7 months</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>76   **</td></tr></table></p><p>*Ready for scheduling means that all appropriate submissions and other documents have been received from the parties such that a hearing can be arranged for the case in question.  </p><p>**Included in the figures provided are referrals made from the WRC under section 26(1) Industrial Relations Act 1990.  As it is not possible to ascertain from the Labour Court data processing system the total number of workers who come within each such referral, such referrals are counted as being made by one person for the purposes of this reply. </p><p>In addition, as of 24 June 2019, 89 appellants have been scheduled for hearings by the Labour Court in July and August. In assigning hearing dates the Court typically programmes two months ahead in order to ensure maximum flexibility in responding to requests for postponements, withdrawals, urgent requests for hearings and in order to make best planned use of the resources available to the Court.  </p><p>The Labour Court is still awaiting submissions and/or other documentation from 67 appellants who submitted appeals or referrals in 2019; such information is required before a hearing can be scheduled.  There are also a significant number of other cases received in preceding years and which are either on hold or where submissions and/or other documentation remain outstanding from the parties. The Court continues to work with the parties concerned to ensure these cases are progressed.</p><p>A key factor affecting timelines is that the process of bringing an Employment Equality and Unfair Dismissals case to hearing involves provision of time to make comprehensive written submissions before arrangements can be made to schedule a hearing. A further factor impacting on waiting times for scheduled hearings is the Labour Court&rsquo;s commitment to hear cases in the regions. This commitment can sometimes impact scheduling, as hearings are grouped appropriately.</p></reply>

At the same time there has been a 53% increase in the number of applications processed (7,353 applications processed) compared to the same period last year, clearly demonstrating that productivity is improving.

That&rsquo;s why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p><p>Brexit is my top priority at this time and was central to my decision-making on the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. </p><p>For example, I provided an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme.  I also provided extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create. </p><p>Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding has been increased by 22% in 2019, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The LEOs, which have a presence in every county, are working with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed about Brexit and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 01 March last and a second call of the scheme opened on 19 June. Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. </p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.  ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. In March, it launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with InterTradeIreland paying 50% of total expenditure. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for applications through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in April of this year. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million. </p><p>The first table attached sets out the uptake of the different Brexit-related supports available through my Department and its agencies as at 14 June 2019.</p><p>The second table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p><b>Brexit preparedness supports - uptake of available schemes - 14.6.2019</b><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th><br /><br />Uptake (14 June 2019)</th></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td><br /><br />656 applications received, 596 approved by SBCI, 141 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;31.73 million. <i>(Uptake as of 21 June) </i></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td><br /><br /><b>5,313 </b>Brexit Scorecards have been completed.<b> 1085</b> LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td><br /><br /><b>199</b> Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets</td><td><br /><br /><b>167</b> projects have been approved under this initiative<i>1</i></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td><td><br /><br /><b>3,716 </b>Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td><td><br /><br /><b>1,258 </b>Customs Insights Course participants</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td><br /><br /><b>52</b> Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td><br /><br /><b>16</b> Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over <b>1,200</b> in attendance</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td><br /><br /><b>258 </b>&ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td><br /><br /><b>1,071</b> Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td><br /><br /><b>602</b> clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant<i>2</i></td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td><br /><br /><b>340</b> LEO clients have participated in the programme</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td><br /><br /><b>641</b> mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td><br /><br /><b>4,639</b> Participants at the Brexit Information events</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />Customs Training Participants</td><td><br /><br /><b>468 </b>Participants attended Customs Training</td></tr><tr><td><br /><br />InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td><br /><br /><b>3,045</b> SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.

The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published on 11 March. </p>  <p>  Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:</p>  <p>  - detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments at a total cost of &euro;58 million; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes at a cost of &euro;5 million; and 40,000 outpatient first appointments at a cost of &euro;6 million.</p>  <p>  - It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including cataracts, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, the NTPF has advised that for the period January to May 2019 the NTPF has arranged treatment for 636 patients awaiting a cataract procedure on the Saolta Hospital Group Inpatient/Day Case Waiting List.  Under the 2019 Scheduled Care Access Plan, it is projected that all clinically suitable patients waiting over 6 months for cataract surgery will receive an offer of treatment by year end.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of issues for more detailed consideration, including a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. As part of its work on the review the NTPF sought various inputs including external expertise and stakeholder engagement to inform the review. These inputs were considered in detail. It is recognised that any change to any part of the Scheme must be considered in terms of the short- and long-term impact on the viability of the Scheme and accessibility of long-term residential care in general. It is therefore important that the relevant issues are considered thoroughly.</p>  <p>  The NTPF has now completed its report and the Steering Group has completed its consideration of it, the report was recently submitted by the NTPF to the Department. It is now being reviewed by Department officials and any recommendations included in the report will be appraised before publication.

A wide-ranging set of modernisation measures has also been agreed in the areas of eHealth, medicines management and multidisciplinary working.</p>  <p>  There will be increased support for GPs working in rural practices and for those in disadvantaged urban areas. Improvements in the maternity and paternity leave arrangements have also been agreed, in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family friendly commitments. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the current GMS contract, GPs are required to provide eligible patients with ''all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess." There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for medical services provided under the contract. </p>  <p>  GPs contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme are obliged to provide services to their medical card and GP visit card patients, including those resident in nursing homes. GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. Currently, an annual capitation payment of &euro;434.15 is payable in respect of each GMS patient over 70 years of age residing in a private nursing home approved by the HSE for periods in excess of 5 weeks.</p>  <p>  The recent phase of talks with GP representatives did not specifically address the provision of services to residents of nursing homes but focused on the development of a range of modernisation, reform and sustainability measures for GMS and GP visit card patients.  Along with most other capitation rates, the nursing home rate will increase by approximately 48% over the next 4 years, under the recent agreement. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-06-26a.428.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019062600082#WRK03700"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility examined the issue of awarding medical cards on the basis of illness and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  However, it is undoubtedly important that the medical card application system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, especially arrangements relating to the issuing of medical cards on a discretionary basis. To that end, the HSE has sought to implement revised processes to provide a more compassionate and more efficient process in the assessment of medical card applications. Such measures include the development of a Burden of Illness Questionnaire which is now being rolled out in selective circumstances where the assessing doctor in the HSE's National Medical Card Unit requires a more comprehensive assessment of an applicant's medical and social circumstances and any resulting undue financial hardship.</p>  <p>  In addition, in January 2018 a new streamlined online medical card application system was launched. This enables applicants to find out immediately if they are eligible for a medical card and brings considerable benefits for people in terms of turnaround times, convenience and security. This measures aid the HSE's National Medical Card Unit to provide an enhanced service to applicants ensuring that the application process is as efficient and timely as possible. </p>  <p>  While it is none the less important to note that eligibility for a medical card remains primarily on the basis of financial assessment, I do recognise that patients require a responsive and efficient health system to meet their medical needs, which may often be required urgently. With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years.</p>  <p>  As the administration of medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, I have asked them to reply to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. </p></reply>

In designing the scheme, my Department consulted with stakeholders and the scheme was trialled during the pilot phase.  The 2018 Scheme enjoyed excellent level of participation, with over 600 forest owners taking part.  </p>  <p>  The aim of the KT scheme for forestry is to improve knowledge of forest management amongst as many of the 20,000 private forest landowners in the country as possible.  In this regard, it was decided that priority use of the available budget in the first three years of the scheme should go to giving as many of this group as possible access to at least one year of the programme. This will help build a solid foundation of forestry knowledge among a strong cohort of landowners. This can be reviewed at the end of the three years pilot programme.</p>  <p>  I would emphasise though that there is absolutely nothing to stop any KT group continuing to meet beyond their one year in the scheme, either formally or informally, at their own initiative.  In fact, this is something I would actively encourage and there are options for them to do so either through their local Producer Group for example or to establish a discussion group.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the Scheme recently launched for 2019, allowing for a fresh intake of participants, and has attracted considerable interest.  These applications are currently being reviewed with a view to approving new groups shortly. </p></reply>

It may also support innovative interventions in these sectors. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund will be funded through non-exchequer sources and therefore not impact the exchequer balance. The sources of funding include the use of unspent monies in the Energy Efficiency Fund and the repurposing of part of the existing petroleum products levy (commonly called the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy). The annual contributions to the fund from the NORA levy are projected to be circa &euro;60 million on average per annum from 2020. </p>  <p>  The first call for applications under the Climate Action Fund was a competitive call for grant funding that was open to the private sector and the public sector &ndash; with the exception of Government Departments. In the first round of the fund, &euro;77 million is being allocated to 7 projects, leveraging a total investment of &euro;300 million. </p>  <p>  Although the scope of future calls has not yet been finalised, I expect a similarly competitive process will be employed. The outcome of these calls will determine the proportion of support provided to the public and private sectors. </p>  <p>  The need for future calls under the Climate Action Fund to support a number of climate and energy priorities has been set out in the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  A number of the successful projects from the first call for applications that I announced last November have been included in the Climate Action Plan. These are the Dublin District Heating System (receiving support of up to &euro;20 million), the Tallaght District Heating Scheme (receiving support of up to &euro;4.5 million), ESB&rsquo;s Electric Vehicle High Power Charging Infrastructure Development Project (receiving support of up to &euro;10 million) and Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s Green Renewable Agricultural Zero Emissions Gas Project (receiving support of up to &euro;8.5 million).</p></reply>

Irish policy in this area is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP.  </p><p>These guidelines provide scientifically-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ComReg, the independent telecoms regulatory authority, ensures that licensed mobile operators comply with their licence conditions and do not exceed ICNIRP guidelines. </p><p>In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM). This was published in 2016 and is entitled <i>&ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;</i>. It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication. This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, <i>&ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;</i>, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p><p>This is an area that is kept under review, and in this regard, I have recently assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area.</p></reply>

Progress is reported annually by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the most recent report, covering the period to 2017, is available at:</p><p> </p><p>This records that, by the end of 2017, cumulative energy efficiency improvements of 24% were achieved, equivalent to a cumulative emissions saving of 3.6 million tonnes CO2 eq. </p><p>Specific results for the health sector are also published by SEAI online at:</p><p>This records that the HSE and acute hospitals in 2017 accounted for 1,542 GWh, or 15% of total energy demand (including electricity consumed), in the public sector in 2017. Based on energy savings achieved, relevant bodies have achieved cumulative emissions savings of 463,000 tonnes CO2 eq. Energy and emissions savings data in 2017 for individual organisations, including those in the health sector, is also available online at . </p><p>SEAI actively supports energy efficiency in hospitals, helping those bodies save energy through a structured management approach. Targeted capital supports are also provided for developing project pipelines. For the HSE specifically, SEAI funds an Energy Bureau, which includes the following supports:</p><p>- energy awareness teams</p><p>- targeting the top 50 energy-using facilities</p><p>- developing a project pipeline</p><p>- behavioural and low cost projects</p><p>- energy strategy development for 2020 and 2030</p><p>I am informed that the monitoring and reporting system employed by SEAI for the purposes of the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy is unique to Ireland, and there is currently no basis for comparing energy-related emissions from public hospitals in different EU Member States.</p><p>I published the Government's Climate Action Plan on 17 June. The Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan commits to reducing public sector emissions by 30% and improving the public sector energy efficiency by 50% by 2030. </p><p>The Plan also includes a commitment to require each public body to adopt a Climate Action Mandate. The mandate will involve a &lsquo;core&rsquo; group of requirements that every public body will have to meet, and a wider set that should be pursued by larger organisations. The core requirements will have specific timelines for their introduction, be clearly measureable against a set of key performance indicators, and may include the following:</p><p>- every public building with public access to display an up-to-date Display Energy Certificate</p><p>- pursuing and reporting on resource efficiency actions across all public facilities, including measures to reduce food waste, promote water conservation, waste segregation, reuse and recycling practices</p><p>- collaborating with suppliers and service providers in joint decarbonisation initiatives, including working with clients to adopt low carbon approaches such as the development of clusters</p><p>In addition, large public bodies may be required to commit to other measures such as:</p><p>- achieving formal environmental accreditation, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, and ISO 50001</p><p>- a proportion of energy to come from certified renewable sources and/or onsite renewables</p><p>- active management of equipment containing refrigerant gases, including maintenance and disposal planning</p></reply>

The project is a collaboration between Retrofit Energy Ireland Limited (REIL), the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) and the Solution Centre, together with over 20 credit unions across the Dublin, South West and Galway regions (including a number of staff-based credit unions). </p>  <p>  The project offers a one stop shop to Credit Union members to upgrade the energy efficiency of their homes.</p>  <p>  Under the project, REIL will provide a free survey and advice on a home upgrade, and will arrange quotes and quality assure works, as well as discounting the SEAI grant from the cost of works. They are partnering with CUDA and 20 Credit Unions to provide low cost finance at a maximum of 6.9% interest rate, for the costs of works. In addition, REIL will cover the cost of the first year&rsquo;s finance with the Credit Union on behalf of participating householders. It is hoped to upgrade over 200 homes under this pilot project.</p>  <p>  The Proenergy project is the latest in a series of trials and pilots on financing conducted under the Better Energy Finance Pilot Programme. Other initiatives supported by the Programme include testing employer salary incentive schemes and deep retrofit projects with bank finance. In 2018, this has extended to a number of pilots with a consumer finance house, flexifi. </p>  <p>  The Better Energy Finance Pilot is, in turn, part of the Better Energy Programme, which is funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI. The Programme consists of three main schemes which provide grants to homeowners to improve their energy efficiency: Homes, Warmer Homes and Communities. These schemes are supplemented by two pilot schemes exploring the multiple benefits of energy efficiency and the challenges of moving to deeper retrofit: Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme and the Deep Retrofit Pilot. I have allocated &euro;85m to this Programme in 2019. </p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action Plan sets ambitious targets of 500,000 retrofits as well as the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes. The Plan commits government to developing a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy pay-back methods. The savings on electricity bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer and produce less emissions. An area based retrofit programme, not unlike aspects of the Proenergy project, would seek to capitalise on critical mass, leveraging economies of scale that would benefit both householders and the supply chain. This type of programme would focus on designated areas in both rural and urban environments and could be designed and delivered to include local authorities, approved housing bodies or other strategic delivery partners. It would also take account of the priorities to achieve greater depth of retrofit and the targeted replacement of oil boilers with renewable alternatives. The lessons learned from the Better Energy Finance Programme and wider Better Energy Programme will be of great assistance in designing the policies and approaches required to deliver on this target. The Climate Action Plan also highlights the need for urgent action given the critical nature of the climate challenges that face us. For that reason, I would encourage homeowners to avail of the supports and financing options currently available.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Details of the regional and local road grant allocations and payments to local authorities are outlined in the regional and local road grant booklets which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  </p><p>The tables included in the payment and allocation booklets outline expenditure by type of grant programme.  The total investment in regional and local roads this year is &euro;483.4 million and the estimated cost of increasing this by 5% is &euro;24.2 million.  For the Deputy's information an explanation of the purpose of the main Regional and Local Road Grant Programmes is set out below, along with a table showing spend to date in 2019 in these grant categories:</p><p><b>Restoration Maintenance (RM): </b>The purpose of the RM grant is to protect the structural integrity of the road by way of surface dressing through the sealing of the road surface.  The purpose of restoration maintenance is to maintain the asset before it requires improvement.  <b></b></p><p><b>Restoration Improvement Grant (RI):</b>The RI grant programme is the main road strengthening programme and caters for surface restoration, pavement overlay works, complete road rehabilitation works and for drainage works where required. </p><p><b>Discretionary Grant (DG): </b>Councils have discretion in spending these grants for improvement and maintenance works subject to selecting from a list of eligible works. However Councils are requested to prioritise projects which involve strengthening works, remedying road defects, winter maintenance and drainage works.</p><p><b>Bridge Rehabilitation (BR): </b>This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake bridge rehabilitation works. </p><p><b>Safety Improvement Works (BS)</b>: This programme allows local authorities to apply for monies to undertake safety improvement works. </p><p><b>Community Involvement Scheme (CIS):</b>The programme facilitates community involvement in repair and improvement of roads.  </p><p><b>Drainage Programme:  </b>The purpose of this grant is to promote network resilience. </p><p>A pilot scheme has been implemented to provide assistance to local authorities specifically for the maintenance of Former National (FN) roads. </p><p><b>Specific Grant and Strategic Grants: </b>The Department no longer seeks annual applications from local authorities in respect of the Specific (road improvement schemes costing up to &euro;5m.) and Strategic (improvement schemes costing over &euro;5m.) grant programmes. Instead it considers projects on a case by case basis taking into account the availability of funding and the outcome of project appraisals.</p><p><b>Severe Weather: </b>Arising from a commitment made regarding flood damage to RLR in Donegal in 2017, provision is being made to meet outstanding repair costs.<table><tr><th>Grant Category</th><th>2019 Spend to Date &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>Restoration Improvement</td><td>34,289,605</td></tr><tr><td>Restoration Maintenance</td><td>3,736,545</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary RM</td><td>346,743</td></tr><tr><td>Bridge Rehabilitation</td><td>1,033,425</td></tr><tr><td>Safety Improvement Works</td><td>396,697</td></tr><tr><td>Community Involvement Scheme</td><td>1,639,893</td></tr><tr><td>Discretionary Grant</td><td>38,289,506</td></tr><tr><td>Drainage Works</td><td>2,623,842</td></tr><tr><td>Former National Roads</td><td>3,226</td></tr><tr><td>Specific Improvement Grants</td><td>1,685,817</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic RLR Grants</td><td>13,677,642</td></tr><tr><td>Severe Weather</td><td>574,596</td></tr></table></p><p>As regards national roads, within its annual budget, allocations to individual local authorities is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).

This means ensuring &lsquo;steady state&rsquo; levels of investment in our rail infrastructure each year for the foreseeable future and requires a significant and recurring capital investment of approximately &euro;200 million from the taxpayer every year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Infrastructure Manager Multi-Annual Contract (or IMMAC) provides the funding framework for the maintenance and renewal of our railway infrastructure and is a statutory contractual agreement between the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the increases I secured in Budget 2019 mean that the Exchequer contribution to the IMMAC has increased this year to &euro;197 million, thus ensuring that the steady state funding requirement (as measured on an annualised basis) is met for 2019.  </p>  <p>  This represents significant, and very welcome, progress in terms of the overall funding of the network and means that funding for the IMMAC as increased by 23% as compared with 2018.</p>  <p>  Separately, capital funding is also provided to Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann through the National Transport Authority (NTA) as part of the heavy rail enhancement programme. This programme supports projects such as the continued planning and design of the DART Expansion Programme, the City Centre Resignalling Project, the replacement of the roof at Pearse Station, the development of the new National Train Control Centre and various other enhancement projects. </p>  <p>  As this funding programme is managed by the NTA, I have referred the Deputy's question to it for direct reply, please inform my private office if you do you receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

My Department has no grant application on hand in relation to the proposed Drogheda Northern Cross Port Access road.</p>  <p>  Given the cutbacks in State funding for regional and local roads since the financial crisis, it has been necessary to curtail the grant programme for major new regional and local road schemes and for major realignment schemes in order to protect the funding available for the maintenance of the existing network.

Cycling and walking, have an important role to play in easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our towns and cities.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is probably aware between Census 2006 and Census 2016 there has been a 56% increase in the numbers cycling to work with significant increases recorded in a number of our major urban centres.  These increases have been recorded against the policy backdrop provided by both Smarter Travel &ndash; A Sustainable Transport Future and the National Cycle Policy Framework, both of which were published in 2009 with a horizon out to 2020.</p>  <p>  Of course, the Deputy will recognise that, notwithstanding the undoubted progress achieved since 2009, the Budgetary parameters during the initial years of both policies meant that the resources available to support implementation were constrained due to the economic and financial crisis and its aftermath.  The Deputy will welcome, as I do, the fact that this Government is now in a position to make significant and increasing funding available to support active travel infrastructure, education and behavioural change programmes.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the fact that we now have the funding available to support the implementation of the various cycle network plans in our major cities that have been developed in the last few years. In more rural areas, we have of course published the new Greenways Strategy and last week Minister of State Griffin and I announced details of the &euro;40 million that is being made available to support greenways development in 9 different counties across the country.</p>  <p>  In the coming weeks, and in line with a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, I will seek the public's views on public transport and active travel policy.  This review will allow all stakeholders to reflect on what has been achieved, what remains to be done and how our policy frameworks can support the realisation of a more sustainable transport system, including through increasing the numbers of cyclists. </p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging with the Deputy during this process and hearing his views in relation to the promotion of active travel as a mode of transport. </p></reply>

Government investment in services for young people has increased since 2016 by, in the region of, &euro;8.5m.  In 2019 we have invested &euro;63.6M in current and capital funding in clubs, services and young people 2019. </p>  <p>  The Targeted Youth Funding Scheme has been allocated &euro;35.18 million for 2019 to provide out of school supports to young people in their local communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential by strengthening their personal and social competencies. Young people aged 10 to 24 years of age who are described in the National Youth Strategy as marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable will be the primary target group for services available through the new scheme. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;11m is allocated to 30 national and major regional voluntary organisations through the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This funding is made available on an annual basis to 30 national and major regional voluntary organisations. The continued funding of voluntary youth organisations through the Scheme is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. </p>  <p>  For 2019, just over &euro;2m in funding is being provided to local youth groups through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports volunteer-led youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local Education and Training Boards. The scheme is open to over 1,600 youth groups and clubs. Each year, over 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.</p>  <p>  In 2019 &euro;1.37m is available through the Youth Information Centres Programme which funds 21 Youth Information Centres. The purpose of these Centres is to provide young people with access to information on rights, opportunities, benefits, health, welfare and other matters. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware my Department is currently managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State as well as an Area Profiling, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement tool which was designed in collaboration with the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector and was officially launched in January 2019. This mapping and tool will assist the Department and the relevant ETBs in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify requirements in their area and facilitate decisions on service requirement by reference to evidenced need.</p></reply>

It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme is scheduled to open in October, with payments flowing in November.  In line with this timeframe, it is projected to cost &euro;35m over the final two months of 2019, and to have a full-year cost of approximately &euro;200m in 2020.  These estimates include the cost of the significant enhancements which were agreed and announced as part of Budget 2019, including:</p><p>- increasing the Multiple Child Discount from &euro;3,800 to <b>&euro;4,300</b>.  </p><p>- increasing the minimum NET income threshold from &euro;22,700 to<b>&euro;26,000,</b></p><p><b>- </b>increasing the maximum NET income threshold from &euro;47,500 to <b>&euro;60,000.</b></p><p>It should be noted that many of the families eligible for the Scheme already avail of childcare supports funded by my Department.  To make the transition to the new National Childcare Scheme as smooth as possible, those families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme in October or to remain on their current support for one final programme year.  This may affect the National Childcare Scheme expenditure estimate. </p><p>In addition, the introduction of this new and innovative Scheme may impact parental choices with regard to childcare. While my Department's model takes account of this, it is based on the best available evidence-informed estimates which may need to be revisited after the Scheme launches.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme has been designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates which can be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.  As such, the Scheme will establish a sustainable platform for investment in early learning and care and school age childcare for years to come.</p></reply>

The scheme is being led locally by the relevant Local Authorities, in close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, and is overseen by my Department.</p><p>The 6 towns which were identified for inclusion in the pilot are:</p><p>1.

The funding is being used by the Local Authorities to engage with communities and local businesses in order to identify practical solutions to repurposing vacant premises and increase the number of people living in their town centres.  </p><p>It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.  The lessons learnt through this pilot initiative will also help to inform the Government's approach to supporting and investing in rural towns and villages in the future, including any further expansion of the approach adopted in the pilot.</p></reply>

The estimated additional cost of extending the duration of maternity benefit for an additional four weeks would be approximately &euro;39 million in a full year.</p>  <p>  There would also be additional costs for employers including substitution and public sector pay costs which would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Decisions around the extension of this benefit would have to be considered in a budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I have also announced the introduction of a new paid parental benefit for parents which will support parents to spend additional time with their babies and provide more flexibility in managing a work life balance. This new benefit will provide for 2 weeks paid leave to each parent of a child, age under 1 year, on parental leave from work. These 2 weeks are additional to that already available under maternity benefit and paternity benefit. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions.  This and other care-related supports, such as the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant, provide recognition and support for the valuable role of carers.</p>  <p>  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for.  It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks.  The current weekly rate is &euro;220.00.  Where a person is caring for two or more care recipients, the rate of payment is increased by 50%.   </p>  <p>  At the end of May 2019, there were 2,724 carers in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit.  An Increase for a Qualified Child  was being made in respect of 824 children, 302 of whom are aged 12 years or more.  Estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2019 is &euro;37.83m.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to estimate the cost of extending the number of weeks Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is paid from 104 to 156 weeks due to the unpredictability of the variables underlying this payment.  This is primarily due to not being able to forecast the extent of the possible duration of payment for existing recipients and also because of the potential for an increase in the number of claims if the payment is available for an extended period.  Some recipients have recently started receiving payment, others are reaching the end of the max payment period and others are only in receipt of the payment for a short period of time e.g. in the case of a terminal illness.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that not all those claiming Carer&rsquo;s Benefit opt to remain in payment for the full 104 weeks.  My Department examined this matter in 2017 and found that the average duration on Carer&rsquo;s Benefit was 74.2 weeks between 2010 and 2016.  Therefore, the current 104 week payment duration represents a reasonable length of time to support a carer&rsquo;s temporary absence from work.  Where care is provided beyond the period of entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, the means tested Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is available for those who are in need of income support.  These arrangements ensure an efficient use of public funds while assisting those who are in most need of an income support. </p>  <p>  Furthermore the right to carer's leave from employment complements the Carer's Benefit Scheme. The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees to leave their employment temporarily to provide full-time care for someone in need of full-time care and attention.  A person is entitled to take carer&rsquo;s leave of at least 13 weeks up to a maximum of 104 weeks.  Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act ensures that people who want to take carer's leave will have their jobs kept open for them while they are on carer's leave. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 944,000 customers with direct eligibility.  In Budget 2019 the funding for the free travel scheme was increased by &euro;5 million to a total of &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  Providing an accurate projection of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, taking into account increases announced in Budget 2019 is very difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the number of newly qualified people. The fact that many operators have reduced fares for children and that in some cases children under five years of age can travel for free would also have to be taken into account. Taking all of this into consideration the yearly cost of the measure suggested by the Deputy could be as high as &euro;5.25 million. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to all children that are in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations, and funding priorities for the Free Travel Scheme generally. </p>  <p>  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of  Employment Affairs and Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants, and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.

The estimated spend on the WFP in 2018 was approximately &euro;431 million.</p><p>To qualify for payment of WFP a person must be engaged in full time paid employment as an employee which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.

Class B covers permanent and pensionable civil servants recruited prior to 6 April 1995, registered doctors and dentists employed in the civil service and Garda&iacute; recruited prior to 1995.  Class C is paid by commissioned army officers and members of the army nursing service, recruited prior to 6 April 1995.  Class D is paid by permanent and pensionable employees in the public service other than those insured at Classes B and C, for example, employees of semi-State commercial bodies.</p>  <p>  Historically, public servants in Ireland were excluded from the scope of full social insurance cover.  The reason for this is that their terms of employment were deemed adequate to protect them against the main contingencies, of sickness and old age, and the risk of unemployment was not considered a factor in their case.</p>  <p>  Consequently, modified rate contributors pay less PRSI in return for fewer benefits.  Currently Class B contributors, for example, pay the employee PRSI rate of 0.9% (4% on weekly earnings over &euro;1,443) and their employer pays a contribution rate of 2.01%.  Class B contributors are currently entitled to widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardians payment (contributory),  limited occupational injuries benefits and carer's benefit.</p>  <p>  This contrasts with Class A contributors who pay a 4% employee contribution rate, their employer pays a contribution of either 8.7% or 10.95%, for a combined contribution rate of 12.7% or 14.95%.  Class A contributors therefore gain entitlement to all social welfare benefits.</p>  <p>  Modified rate contributors who do not have sufficient means may qualify for the means tested State pension (non-contributory)</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Strategic Funding Plan, which I have approved, details Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic funding requirement of &euro;11bn to 2024, comprising of a &euro;6.1bn investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9bn in operating costs.</p>  <p>  Irish Water will also play a key role in implementing Project Ireland 2040 which was published in February 2018 and incorporates the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the National Development Plan. Irish Water will take account of and support on-going work in developing subsidiary strategies to assist in implementing the NPF including the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of County Development Plans and Local Area Plans.</p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water will be bringing forward proposals for a Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme which will support a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the NPF. The Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. Irish Water will work with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies. </p>  <p>  Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.  These submissions are currently being considered and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.  Subject to the outcome of this process it will then be a matter for Irish Water to progress its proposals in relation to the Small Towns &amp;amp; Villages Growth Programme. </p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

In early 2019, local authorities were advised to proceed with works of up to 65% of their overall 2018 allocation in respect of the DPG scheme, to ensure that there was no delay in works commencing. Some &euro;15 million is being made available under the scheme in 2019, an increase of over &euro;1 million on 2018. </p>  <p>  In implementing the scheme, it is a matter for local authorities to prioritise the works to be funded under the scheme in their area, in the context of available funding and in line with the terms of the DPG scheme.

It will be open to local authorities to seek additional funding, once their allocation is fully expended.</p></reply>

Under the scheme, a discount of up to 40% may be provided by the local authority to the prospective purchaser of an affordable home.  The local authority will retain a charge equivalent to the discount, and the household must repay the charge at re-sale or during the charged period.  The scheme applies to new homes on local authority land, and is targeted at low to middle-income households.  The monies of the equity charge will be repaid by the purchaser into a new Affordable Dwellings Fund, which will be administered by the Housing Finance Agency and used to fund further affordable housing.     </p>  <p>  One of the mechanisms available to local authorities to help them deliver affordable housing options is the Serviced Site Fund (SSF).   Under the SSF, &euro;310 million is being made available over a three year period, from 2019 to 2021, to support the delivery of infrastructure on local authority sites, which will deliver over 6,000 affordable homes.   </p>  <p>  The first call for proposals under the SSF in June 2018 was targeted at 11 local authorities, including Galway City, where it was identified that the greatest affordability pressures exist.  I issued approval in principle in December 2018 for funding for 10 infrastructure projects in Dublin and Cork with &euro;43 million funding, which will support the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes. A further 5 projects, including one from Galway City Council at B&oacute;thar an Choiste, with the potential to delivery 45 affordable homes were not granted initial approval.  However, my Department is currently liaising with these local authorities in order to further develop these projects.     </p>  <p>  Following the first call under the SSF, and in order to target affordable interventions, local authorities were asked to complete financial/economic assessments of each of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes is economically viable.  Local authorities were also asked to assess the broader housing affordability within their area.  </p>  <p>  A second call for proposals under the SSF issued to 19 local authorities, including Galway City Council and Galway County Council, on 9 April 2019, based on the aforementioned economic assessments.  The closing date for returns was 17 May 2019 and 31 submissions were received from 15 local authorities, including one from Galway City Council in respect of a site in Merlin Park, with the potential to deliver 95 affordable homes, and two from Galway County Council, in Oughterard and Athenry, with the potential to deliver 72 affordable homes. </p>  <p>  These are currently being assessed by my Department and I intend to issue approvals under this second call in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The overall cost and timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible, with the first tranche of affordable homes expected to be delivered next year.</p></reply>

This project is important for the border region with potential to stimulate economic activity, giving a much needed boost to job creation and with the growth in water based tourism helping to attract significant numbers of visitors to the area.  This is increasingly significant in the context of Brexit.  </p>  <p> Government approval for Phase 1 of this project, to restore a 2.5 km stretch of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to the International Scout Centre at Castle Saunderson near Belturbet in Co. Cavan, was secured in February 2015.   </p>  <p> The works to complete this first phase were concluded earlier this year.  A new 250m bypass canal and new road bridge to provide navigation around the existing road bridge serving Derrykerrib Island, which had insufficient head height for navigation, have now been constructed. Installation of moorings at Castlesaunderson as a destination for boats using the newly opened navigation from the Erne to Castlesaunderson will be completed in 2019.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;260,000 has been allocated towards the restoration of the Ulster Canal in 2019. Waterways Ireland anticipates expenditure of  &euro;160,000  to complete payment for works at Derrykerrib and &euro;100,000 for construction works for Castlesaunderson public moorings.</p>  <p>  In May 2018, the Government approved Phase 2, the development the amenity of a 13km section of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones - with the first element being a water amenity in Clones, and re-committed to developing this cross-border stretch under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, in the category of Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage.</p>  <p> Further funding of &euro;325,000 was allocated under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund for this second phase of development to develop the Clones Terminal, along the original route of the Ulster Canal.</p></reply>
