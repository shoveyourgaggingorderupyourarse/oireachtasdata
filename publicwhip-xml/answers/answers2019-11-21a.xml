    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100051#WRA00700"><p>Firstly, I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  However, under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, construction and operation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the Local Authorities concerned.</p><p>I would also like to stress that I fully recognise the demand pressures on the M50. </p><p><b>Demand management measures. </b></p><p>TII, along with other relevant stakeholders, has completed a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including: </p><p>-  enhanced vehicle recovery services; </p><p>-  establishment of an Inter-agency Incident Coordination Group; </p><p>-  changes to merging and diverging layouts at junctions; </p><p>-  establishment of signed Emergency Diversion Routes; and</p><p>-  improved access for incident support and emergency services.  <b></b></p><p><b>[Enhancing Motorway Operation Services (EMOS)]</b></p><p>TII has also commenced a project entitled &lsquo;Enhancing Motorway Operation Services (EMOS) to which the Deputy refers. This project will include Variable Speed Limits, referred to as VSLs and Lane Control Signalling.</p><p><b>[Variable Speed Limits (VSLs)]</b></p><p>The VSL regime on the M50 is intended to improve the operational efficiency of the motorway by </p><p>-  smoothing traffic flow, </p><p>-  improving journey time reliability, and </p><p>-  reducing the number of traffic collisions.</p><p>As I mentioned, lane control signalling will also be installed as part of the project which will allow the rapid closing off of lanes. </p><p><b>Status of the project.</b></p><p>With regard to the status of the EMOS project, my Department is progressing the legislative arrangements to provide TII with the powers to operate VSLs.  The legislative proposals will be contained in the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  A General Scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government for formal drafting, subject to two items  being examined further.  </p><p>These two items - for graduated speeding penalties and the carrying of driving licences - have now been examined in detail at Cabinet Committee and I shall be referring them back to Government shortly.  In the meantime, work on drafting the other provisions of the Bill is under way in the Office for the Attorney General.  I hope to publish the Bill before the end of the year.  </p><p>I am also advised that, in order to progress this important measure, TII is extending the motorway traffic control centre at Dublin Tunnel to cater for the additional workload from introduction of VSLs.  Phase 1, which includes the new Control Room, is expected to be handed over before the end of this month (November 2019). Tender competitions to procure the management systems and hardware for the operation and roll-out of VSLs for the M50 are progressing. Tenders for the software were returned at the end of last month (October 2019) and the tenders for the hardware are due back this week.</p><p>All the preparatory technical and logistical frameworks will need to be put in place by TII before VSLs can be introduced and become operational.  As I have just explained, this work is ongoing and I  expect that the first phase will be completed in mid-2020.</p><p><b>Public Transport Role</b></p><p>In addition, Project Ireland 2040 identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme. These will be delivered by the National Transport Authority (NTA) progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network that will match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade, all of which will have a positive effect on the M50.  </p><p><b>Funding allocated and amount drawn down to date.</b></p><p>In 2019, TII provided an allocation of &euro;16.75m to progress this project.</p><p>Approximately &euro;12m has been drawn down to-date in 2019.</p><p>I very much support this project and look forward to its introduction. </p></reply>

Overseas visitor data released by the CSO for the first half of 2019 show that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors was &euro;2,276 million, up 0.3% on the same period in 2018. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I secured an allocation of &euro;186 million for tourism, up 10% (over &euro;17m) on the 2019 allocation, which puts the sector in a strong position to grow next year. The additional resources in 2020 are primarily directed at tourism product development, including Greenways, and build on the &euro;35 million increase in 2019. Furthermore, &euro;7 million is being provided in a 2019 supplementary budget, to support accelerated tourism marketing initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of Brexit. Budget 2020 also provided for an additional &euro;40 million contingency fund in the event of a No-Deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently unveiled its plans for 2020 which focus on helping to sustain and support the tourism industry region by region.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland will launch its 2020 marketing plans in early December. These plans will be consistent with the tourism commitments under the Government's Global Ireland Strategy. Under this Strategy, we are committed to developing tourism from new and emerging tourism markets with potential for Ireland. In Budget 2019, I provided almost &euro;4 million in additional funding to Tourism Ireland to enable it to commence the implementation of strategies for growth in these new and emerging markets.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in July of this year, the Government adopted new Tourism targets out to 2025. The headline target is revenue from overseas tourists of &euro;6.5 billion (in real terms) by 2025.  Secondary targets have also been set and they are: employment in the sector increasing to 310,000; and 11.6 million overseas tourist visits by 2025. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100051#WRA01400"><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the 41 additional InterCity Railcars recently approved by Government will benefit Northern Line commuters, as well as commuters on the Maynooth and Kildare Lines.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware Government has approved this project which will provide a 34% increase to capacity across the GDA commuter rail network in advance of the much bigger increases which will be delivered under the DART Expansion Programme.</p>  <p>  This increase in capacity will be provided principally through lengthening existing trainsets, but also through providing some additional services. I am not aware of any infrastructure works required as a result of the proposal, although the overall project cost does include compatability works associated with the integration of the new carriages with the existing rail fleet.</p>  <p>  I understand final contracts will be exchanged in the next few weeks and as the Deputy has already referred to, delivery will commence by late 2021.</p>  <p>  The specific benefits for Northern Line commuters are considerable with a projected 20% increase in capacity once the project is completed. As mentioned some of this additional capacity will be delivered through moving current 5-car sets to 6-car sets or other extended configurations. </p>  <p>  However the Northern Line will also benefit through the provision of two new additional services in the morning peak, which will be very welcome to those commuters who rely on the Line to get into work each morning. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, this is an intermediate measure ahead of a much bigger expansion of services on the Northern Line which will be delivered through the DART Expansion Programme. That Programme will see a massive expansion of fleet through the purchase of a minimum of 300 battery-electric or electric units, with the potential for that to increase to 600 units over a ten-year period, while the Programme will also electrify the Northern Line as far north as Drogheda.</p>  <p>  These are all very welcome developments and I look forward to their implementation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100051#WRA01700"><p>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (Statutory Instrument Number 495 of 2019) builds on the previous legislation in relation to dangerous overtaking.  These regulations divide the offence of dangerous overtaking to make it a separate offence to dangerously overtake a pedal cyclist.  This will specifically target those drivers who put cyclists at risk.</p>  <p>  Since 12 November 2019, the offence of dangerously overtaking a pedal cyclist carries a fixed charge of &euro;120 and 3 penalty points.  The increase in the fixed charge to &euro;120, which is significantly higher than most fixed charge amounts, is contained in the recently signed Road Traffic Act 2010 (Part 3) (Fixed Charge Offences) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (Statutory Instrument Number 548 of 2019). </p>  <p>  The aim of the new legislation is to improve the behaviour of those drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles who put cyclists at risk when overtaking. In addition, the associated Road Safety Authority's campaign aimed at educating road users and in particular, motorists, has and will continue to heighten public awareness of the potential risks involved when overtaking cyclists. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of the new dangerous overtaking of a pedal cyclist legislation, as with the existing legislation regarding dangerous overtaking and indeed all Road Traffic legislation, is a matter for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na. It is my understanding that data in relation to the enforcement of this new offence will be recorded on the Garda PULSE system and that statistical information will be eventually be available to assist in any future review of this particular legislation. </p>  <p>  As is the case with all Road Traffic legislation, which will now include this new offence, my officials keep the legislation under frequent review as priorities and the necessary resources allow.</p></reply>

Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated, accessible public transport network. I am aware that the NTA has already responded to the Deputy in this matter.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the National Council for the Blind of Ireland (NCBI) is proposing the construction and development of a state-of-the-art, indoor, accessible transport training centre, to empower people with access needs when preparing for and during their journey using public transport.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the primary goal of the National Transport Training Centre (NTCC) is to provide short-term comprehensive instruction, designed to teach people with disabilities how to travel safely and independently using public transportation. Training will also extend to transport agency staff and other key stakeholders. According to the NTA, the NCBI considers that such a centre has the potential to be transformative in enabling people who would not otherwise be able to become independent transport users, to gain familiarity and build their confidence in a supervised training facility.</p>  <p>  The NTA has confirmed that following a review of the potential benefits of such a facility, it informed the NCBI in July of last year that it was willing to support the NCBI proposal and would be prepared to grant aid the delivery of a National Transport Training Centre if the training faculty was open to other groups with disabilities.  The NTA considers that the centre can perform a pivotal role in expanding the use of public transport by users with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The NTA has informed my Department that the NCBI have confirmed that it had been, and continues to be, their intention to make the facility available to user groups across the disability spectrum.  </p>  <p>  I am also advised that while the NCBI has been in contact with a small number of disability groups, it intends to undertake a more comprehensive consultation process when it finalises arrangements for a potential premises.</p></reply>

All work on this historical scheme is now superseded and any development progressed previously, has been overtaken by newer project appraisal and project management requirements. </p><p>The concept and goals of the &lsquo;Bonagee Link Road&rsquo; have been included and developed as an integral part of Section 2 of the current Trans European Network-Transport (TEN-T) Priority Route Improvement Project. </p><p>The N56/N13/N14 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham scheme is the current project dealing with the N56/N14 link across the River Swilly.</p><p>In 2016, Donegal County Council commissioned a Corridor Needs Study on the TEN&ndash;T Comprehensive  network within Donegal.  This network extends from the Leitrim County boundary in the south of the County to the County border with Derry in the northeast and includes the N14 Letterkenny to Lifford road.  </p><p>The Donegal TEN-T project is an important project for the entire County and indeed for the whole northwest region. It involves completing three new sections of National Road Network in Donegal under the collective heading of the TEN-T Priority Route Improvement Project, as I have mentioned.</p><p>Essentially the overall TEN-T project includes :-</p><p>Section 1: N15/N13 Ballybofey &ndash; Stranorlar Bypass;</p><p>Section 2<b>: </b>N56/N13/N14 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham including the upgrade of the Dual Carriageway as well as  a new N56 link road crossing the River Swilly (  <b>locally referred to as &quot;Bonagee Link&quot; or part of the Letterkenny Relief/Ring Road);</b></p><p>Section 3: N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford Realignment Scheme including the link to A5/Western Transport Corridor in Northern Ireland.</p><p>The objectives of the three schemes are consistent with the National Planning Framework (NPF) 2040 and the core National Strategic Outcomes and priorities as stated in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 to 2027. The projects themselves are individually listed in the NDP.</p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>The Donegal TEN-T project is well advanced through the route selection phase.  The Emerging Preferred Route Corridors were presented to the public on all three Sections earlier this year.  It is anticipated that the <b>Options Selection Report </b>will be finalised<b></b>before the end of 2019. </p><p>Further design, including site investigations, surveys and more consultations with affected landowners will continue through 2019 and 2020. </p><p>It is intended to complete preliminary design and be in a position to request approval to  <b>publish the Compulsory Purchase Order and Environmental Impact Assessments Report for the entire project by mid 2021. </b></p><p><b>Expected Benefits:</b></p><p>The TEN-T Priority Route Improvement project will have many benefits including:</p><p>-  Improved road safety;</p><p>-  Improved journey times;</p><p>-  Improve the local environment through urban bypass;</p><p>-  Significantly improve local and regional connectivity and address infrastructure deficit for regional growth and development distribution.</p><p><b>Funding</b></p><p>TII has provided an allocation of &euro;2.5m in 2019 to Donegal County Council to progress planning and design work on the TEN-T project.  <s></s></p><p>In addition, with the support of DTT&amp;amp;S and TII, Donegal County Council was recently recommended for co-funding, under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Transport 2019 call for proposals, for its TEN-T Priority Route Improvement Project.

By the closing date, 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. This was the highest number of applications ever received.  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. 619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May. The final allocations for capital works were announced in the last week with a total of &euro;39.5m allocated to 1,009 projects.  This means that over &euro;56m was allocated to sports projects under this most recent round which I believe represents a very significant step in improving sports facilities right across the country. </p>  <p>  In view of the fact that the total amount sought by all applicants was &euro;162 million, clearly not all applicants could receive the funding they sought. In relation to how individual grants were decided, the full scoring system was published in advance of assessment work commencing. The main considerations in assessing applications included the level of disadvantage in the area, the likelihood of the project increasing participation, whether the facility would be shared with other organisations and the level of SCP funding previously received by the organisation.</p>  <p>  In relation to future assistance, Minister Ross and I will continue to make the case for enhanced investment in sport infrastructure in the years ahead to ensure that all of the objectives set out in the National Sports Policy are met.  My Department will now undertake a full review of the 2018 round of the SCP to consider any further improvements to the application and allocation process. This Review will also consider the timing and scale of the next round of the Programme but I fully expect that a new round will open for applications in the coming months. </p></reply>

I do not have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of public transport services.  </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally. It also has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of Local Link services funded under the Rural Transport Programme. </p>  <p>  Public transport in rural areas of the country is primarily provided by bus and coach services, as well as rail and small public service vehicles (SPSV) services, which include Taxi, Hackney and Local Area Hackney services.  </p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework commits to provide public transport infrastructure and services to meet the needs of smaller urban centres and rural areas.  It also commits to provide a quality nationwide community-based public transport system in rural Ireland which responds to local needs under the Rural Transport Network and similar initiatives.  </p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) was published alongside the National Planning Framework.  While the NDP is a capital investment plan, it recognises the importance of investment in public transport services outside of the cities and commits to continued investment in such services over the lifetime of the NDP.  Subject to the availability of operational funding support, it is intended to introduce new town bus services in certain large towns to enable their development growth and provide a public transport option for residents and visitors.</p>  <p>  Modal shift from the private car to sustainable means of transport remains central to the transport sector&rsquo;s response to climate change.  Investment in public transport resulted in 269 million passenger journeys across all public transport operators on PSO services in 2018.  That&rsquo;s an increase of 16.3 million, or 6.5% compared to 2017. </p>  <p>  The bus and coach services include Public Service Obligation (PSO) services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann and other operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway services, licensed services provided by commercial operators and Local Link services.  </p>  <p>  Local Link services comprise conventional fixed services with regular routes, stopping places and timetables and Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) services which respond to local demands and which constitute the vast majority of Local Link services.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of bus services in rural areas and that is why funding has been increased over the past number of years, for both PSO and Local Link services in rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Deputy has specifically asked about commuter services and the increased funding has enabled the introduction of over 66 new commuter services into the Local Link network, operating five, six or seven days per week, as well as demand-responsive services. Key features of these new services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages. </p>  <p>  The NTA is also continually working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide improvements on its contracted services. The scope and scale of the changes implemented recently, or planned to be introduced shortly, include improvements to its city and town services and non-urban networks. The changes being implemented on Stage Carriage services focus on delivering enhanced frequency throughout the day with earlier and/or later departures, more frequency and increased weekend services including on Sundays/Public Holidays. </p></reply>

The scheme is also contained in the National Transport Authority (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. </p><p>The bypass is intended to alleviate traffic congestion in the village and to reduce the potential for serious road traffic accidents due to the steep approaches to the very narrow Slane bridge and high number of commercial vehicles using the route. </p><p>The project is currently at Phase 2, route selection stage. Meath County Council has also commissioned a supplementary assessment of East-West options in relation to Slane to assess the N51 traffic implications. In that regard, Meath County Council held Public Consultation No. 3 (Emerging Preferred Option) for the scheme in Slane only last week (14 November 2019).  Following consideration of the Public Consultation on the emerging preferred option and the feedback and information gathered, the Options Selection process will be finalised. This process is well advanced and it is anticipated that the preferred route option will be selected later this year.  Once the preferred route is identified, the scheme will be progressed through planning and design.  A Business Case will then be prepared for the approval of both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform. In addition, the statutory documentation will be prepared, including the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR).  Meath County Council has indicated that the scheme is intended to be lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2021, post the adoption of the new County Development Plan. </p><p>TII has provided an allocation of &euro;1m to Meath County Council for the scheme this year. </p><p>The proposed N2 Rath Roundabout to Kilmoon Cross scheme is also included amongst a number of major national road schemes that were identified in the NDP for progression through pre-appraisal and early planning during 2018. In this regard, the Project Pre-Appraisal for the proposed scheme has been approved by my Department. </p><p>This approximately 6 km scheme will address the existing operational and safety problems on this section of the N2, which has an annual average daily traffic of circa 16,000 vehicles per day and experiences considerable peak time congestion.</p><p>Meath County Council has engaged the services of Technical Advisors to commence the planning and design of the scheme. This year, TII has provided an allocation to Meath Co. Co. of &euro;250,000 to progress the scheme. </p><p>I am advised that it typically takes three to five years from this point through Phases 1 &ndash; 4 of the Project Management Guidelines, in order to have a scheme ready to submit to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning approval. </p><p><b>Minor Schemes</b></p><p>The N51 Dunmoe Phase 2 scheme<b></b>comprises the construction of approximately 4 km of single carriageway and associated ancillary and consequential works, including the provision of side roads, accommodation works/roads, junctions, from the townland of Blackcastle Demesne to the townlands of Cruicetown and Pighill in County Meath. An Oral Hearing was held on 12<sup>th</sup>July 2018 and An Bord Pleanala confirmed the CPO for the scheme in October 2018. Meath Co Co are currently progressing the final design and tender documents and intend to go to tender for this scheme in 2020. TII has provided an allocation to Meath Co. Co. of &euro;150,000 for the scheme this year.</p><p>The proposed N52 Grange to Clontail improvement scheme involves the realignment of approximately 3 km section of the existing N52 route.  The scheme will commence at an appropriate tie-in point at the Townland of Grange to the west and extend to an appropriate tie-in point at the Townland of Clontail. The expected benefits fo the scheme are -</p><p>-  to reduce the occurrences of road collisions on the N52 by, for example, providing  increased lengths of overtaking opportunities;</p><p>-  to reduce journey times on the N52; and</p><p>-  to adequately cater for projected increase in traffic volumes.</p><p>The scheme is currently progressing through the early planning and design stage and this year, TII has provided an allocation to Meath Co.

I addressed an FTAI event on 29 August and emphasised the ongoing need for the transport and logistics sector to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department hosted a Brexit Freight Maritime Forum with key road transport and maritime stakeholders, including haulage industry representative bodies, in January of this year.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were also in attendance and addressed the Forum.  My Department was represented at a number of the Irish Retail Grocery and Distribution Sector Roundtable events to date in 2019 hosted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and engagement with this sector, including haulage industry representatives, is continuing.  </p>  <p>  In March, my Department issued a comprehensive Brexit communications notice to all Irish licensed international road haulage operators outlining the position on a range of transport issues that would arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This notice is published in my Department&rsquo;s area of www.gov.ie and the information available online will continue to be updated to keep industry stakeholders informed of Brexit developments.  An updated notice will be issued to the sector in the event of a potential no-deal Brexit on 31 January 2020. </p>  <p>  My Department has also advocated at EU level for contingency measures to assist hauliers in continuing to access the UK market if the UK exits the EU without an agreement in place. Regulation (EU) 2019/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted by the EU on 25 March 2019 to ensure the maintenance of basic road connectivity for road freight transport in the event of a no-deal Brexit, allowing UK road haulage operators to continue to access the EU on the basis that the UK gives reciprocal access to EU road haulage operators.  In October 2019, the period of application of this Regulation was extended to 31 July 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) study into the implications of Brexit on the use of the landbridge, published in November 2018, estimated that approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) travel between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge each year.  A cross-departmental Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was established in October 2017 and has been working on measures aimed at ensuring the ongoing effective and efficient use of the landbridge post-Brexit, including the key Dover-Calais route.  The Group continues to engage with our EU partners to find solutions to minimise the potential disruption to Irish hauliers&rsquo; access to and through the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  In liaison with my Department, the IMDO hosted a workshop on 4 September 2019 to discuss maritime connectivity in the context of Brexit, and the Irish Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association Ireland were invited to this event, along with shipping companies, ports authorities, and importers/exporters.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) has a range of supports available to business including the freight and logistic sector and details can be found on their website www.dbei.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  My Department, along with other Government Departments, has emphasised the importance of stakeholders taking all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations.  I would encourage road haulage operators to refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of road transport, the EU&rsquo;s basic road connectivity contingency Regulation and the section titled &ldquo;Brexit and Transport &ndash; What You Need to Know&rdquo; in my Department&rsquo;s area of www.gov.ie.</p></reply>

This represents a 40% increase in taxpayer support for the rail network as compared to the period 2014 to 2018 and is a hugely significant milestone.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 also provides additional funding for the rail network beyond the increased funding available under the IMMAC. </p>  <p>  Such funding includes the development of a new National Train Control Centre, that Government approved in the summer, and which will completely modernise and improve the management of the network and services across the country.  Its completion will support the expanded services planned under the DART Expansion Programme which will roughly double the capacity of the network in the Greater Dublin Area.  </p>  <p>  Again as I previously informed the Deputy, funding under the PSO programme increased by approximately 6% between 2016 and 2018.  This has supported increased services such as the 10-minute DART or greater utilisation of the Phoenix Park tunnel on the Kildare Line in recent years.  In order to support further passenger growth Government has very recently approved the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars and I expect those to start entering service in late 2021. </p>  <p>  The future potential for rail is also being examined at a metropolitan level through the development by the National Transport Authority of metropolitan area transport strategies for all cities, which will assist with the Department&rsquo;s approach toward the mid-term review of the current Project Ireland 2040 funding profiles envisaged in 2022, while an independent review of a potential extension of the Western Rail Corridor has just been submitted to my Department  My Department also plans to conduct an evaluation in 2020 of higher speeds on the network in line with the commitment given in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  So again, as the Deputy can see, there is a significant investment programme underway in relation to rail and I expect this to continue in the years ahead. </p></reply>

This proposals forms part of the DART Expansion Programme and I expect to receive a business case in relation to the overall programme next year.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the fact that at certain times of the day some rail services are currently crowded due to the level of demand. The Deputy can be assured that the safe operation of the rail network and services is the overriding priority at all times of both the company and, of course, the Commission for Railway Regulation, which is the independent, statutory body charged with overseeing the safety of our network.</p>  <p>  From late September to early December is the busiest commuter period of the year for all transport modes, given the return of third-level educational institutions. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann launched the website peaktime.ie on September 23rd.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that its intention in launching peaktime.ie was to equip those commuters who have flexibility in their travel times with information on demand levels on DARTs serving their stations, thus enabling them to decide their travel times based on the available options.  With one in six weekday DART journeys made between 8am and 9am, the morning peak is particularly concentrated. The information provided on peaktime.ie may enable some commuters to travel at a time when there is greater capacity, thus increasing overall the contribution of DART to providing sustainable transport options for a greater number of commuters and helping those commuters make the modal shift from private to public transport. </p></reply>

Transport has a key enabling role to play in delivering this strategy and PLUTO will help to ensure that transport investment is aligned with and supports the ten National Strategic Outcomes.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan, published in February 2018 at the launch of Project Ireland 2040, notes my Department&rsquo;s development of PLUTO and estimated that a draft report would go to public consultation in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the final report then to be published in 2019. This original timeline has been impacted by a number of factors. </p>  <p>  PLUTO is underpinned by an extensive evidence base comprising of 13 background papers carried out by officials in my Department. These papers consider a wide range of issues such as climate change, Brexit, technology, steady state maintenance, compact growth, rural accessibility, interurban connectivity and international connectivity. Undertaking and finalising this volume of analysis underpinning PLUTO, including associated review and engagement with the Steering Group, has taken longer than originally anticipated.</p>  <p>  To help guide future transport investment to support the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, a particular focus of PLUTO has been identifying potential constraints on the future land transport network. Using the transport models held by the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, this has involved scenario analysis based on National Planning Framework population projections and National Development Plan investment. Ensuring these scenarios were appropriately specified and provided robust evidence for PLUTO took considerable time. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Research and Analysis Division within my Department which is leading the development of PLUTO experienced some staff turnover and held a number of vacancies in the latter half of 2018 and into 2019. While the Division is now operating at capacity, staff moves as the project has developed have influenced the original timeline. </p>  <p>  I note that good progress has been made on PLUTO and I expect that the public consultation on the strategy will now launch in the first quarter of 2020. </p></reply>

Those increased services have been supported through increased PSO subvention which between 2016 and 2018 rose by 9% (including Local Link), as well as increased capital investment.</p>  <p>  In terms of bus, the Deputy is aware that the PSO fleet has increased in recent years with additional buses being added to existing fleets, as well as constant replacement of older, dirtier buses with newer, cleaner buses. That expanded bus fleet has supported expanded bus services with a 7% increase in annual operated vehicle kilometres across both Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath and Bus &Eacute;ireann over the period 2016 to 2018 for example.</p>  <p>  In relation to rail, increased services such as the 10-minute DART and expanded usage of the Phoenix Park Tunnel have facilitated increasing patronage, but I recognise that there are particular capacity pressures now being experienced on the rail network, and in particular on the Greater Dublin Area commuter network which carries approximately 70% of all journeys. In the summer I secured Government&rsquo;s approval for a new National Train Control Centre which will improve the overall management of the network, while more recently Government approved the expansion of the Intercity Railcar fleet through the purchase of 41 additional carriages, which will boost capacity by around 34% across the Maynooth, Kildare and Northern Lines. In addition to these initiatives, I will very shortly seek Government&rsquo;s approval for a &euro;1billion investment programme in our heavy rail network nationally which will provide the investment needed to maintain, renew and improve the network across the country.</p>  <p>  In light rail, the Deputy will likely have already noticed the first of the eventual 26 extensions to the existing Luas Green Line fleet has entered service with additional extensions entering service on a regular basis over the coming months. Next year the 8 additional trams will begin to arrive also which will significantly boost capacity on the Green Line.</p>  <p>  While in active travel my Department is providing increased funding to the NTA to allow it deliver the type of high-quality infrastructure required in our major cities to promote a shift to the active travel modes. </p>  <p>  Of course these are largely short and medium term measures and the Deputy is aware that the longer term substantial increases in the capacity of our public transport network will be brought about through BusConnects in all major cities, DART Expansion across the Greater Dublin Area and MetroLink, each of which is hugely significant in their own right.</p></reply>

This encompasses the National Development Plan 2018-2027 (NDP) which has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the National Planning Framework (NPF).  This provides the strategic and financial framework for TII&rsquo;s national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  </p><p><b>How projects are identified/selected</b></p><p>The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvement projects: &ndash; </p><p>-  The first category covers projects to advance to construction, subject to the satisfactory outcome of the project appraisal and development consent approval processes. </p><p>-  The second category relates to projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stage which are being assessed with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development.</p><p><b>The question of extending the M3 to Cavan town</b></p><p>While early stage assessment work was carried out a number of years ago on a potential road improvement scheme from the end of the M3 motorway, north of Kells to Cavan, this work was subsequently suspended due to funding constraints.</p><p>Therefore, in the context of what I have just outlined, this project is not included amongst the national road schemes that were identified for development during the period of the NDP 2018 - 2027 and the advancement of this scheme cannot, therefore, be accommodated in the national roads programme at present.</p><p><b>N3 Virginia Bypas</b>s</p><p>A bypass of Virginia town is, however, included amongst a number of schemes identified in the NDP for progression through pre-appraisal and early planning during 2018.</p><p>This scheme has been identified as a Strategic Investment Priority in the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.  </p><p><b>Current Status </b></p><p>This project has been subject to Pre-Appraisal in compliance with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Common Appraisal Framework (CAF) to establish if it should be progressed to Stages 1-4 of Planning and Design, in accordance with TII&rsquo;s Project Management Guidelines. The Project Appraisal Plan has been approved by my Department and Technical Advisors were appointed in September 2019 to progress the Scheme to planning, design and appraisal.</p><p><b>Expected Benefits of the Virginia Bypass</b></p><p>The proposed scheme will seek to remove the current inefficiencies of the existing road in terms of safety, capacity and travel times. It is envisaged that it would also have a number of important benefits including:</p><p>-  Improved road safety, by reducing frequency and severity of collisions;</p><p>-  It will support economic growth by increasing network capacity and reducing  travel times between Dublin and the Northwest; </p><p>-  Environmental improvements in noise, air and water quality for Virginia Town and  Lough Ramor, proposed Natural Heritage Area (NHA);</p><p>-  Improved access to the National Road network for the towns of Ballyjamesduff and Bailieborough.</p><p><b>East-West Link</b></p><p>Regarding the reference by the Deputy to the East-West Link,  as I have previously outlined to you on 9th July, 23rd July, and 17th October 2019, proposals to deliver an upgraded East-West route linking Dundalk to Sligo, taking in Cavan, involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible. Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo.</p><p>As regards regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p><p>My Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. </p><p>My Department has discussed the project with Cavan County Council and this year I gave an allocation of &euro;100,000 to the Council to enable it  to undertake a detailed appraisal, in line with the current requirements in the Public Spending Code and the Capital Appraisal Framework, of the Cavan to Dundalk section of the route.  The aim of the detailed appraisal would be to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it can be justified in terms of appraisal and advanced for further consideration in relation to schemes for future development.Preparation of the appraisal is the responsibility of the Council.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government provides for the aim to allocate sports capital grants on an annualised basis.</p>  <p>  The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on Friday 19th October 2018. By the closing date, 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. This was the highest number of applications ever received.  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. 619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May. The final allocations for capital works were announced in the last week with a total of &euro;39.5m allocated to 1,009 projects.  </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round were given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While this new measure did extend the overall timeframe for completing the assessment, the opportunity was well received by applicants and helped ensure the number of invalid applications under this round was the lowest ever.</p>  <p>  Now that all allocations under the Programme have been announced, my Department will shortly commence a full review of all aspects of the latest round. This review will consider, inter alia, if any further changes can be introduced to expedite the assessment process.</p>  <p>  In relation to successful applicants,  all grantees are informed at the time of allocation that they need to make progress in the drawdown of their grant or risk having it withdrawn. It can often take applicants a number of years to fully draw down their grants however, due to issues around legal requirements, delays in the planning process or delays with contractors. Given these genuine reasons for delays in drawing down grants I do not propose to make any changes to the requirements on applicants drawing down grants within a set timeframe at this stage. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  During the recession there were substantial cutbacks in the funding available for State grants for national, regional and local road programmes.  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take time to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. Grants in the three main grant categories (Restoration Improvement, Discretionary Grant and Restoration Maintenance) are allocated taking into account the length of regional and local roads within a local authority area and traffic factors. It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis. </p>  <p>  There is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes and any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget. </p>  <p>  I have been pleased to be able to allocate significantly increased grant funding to Meath County Council in respect of regional and local roads over the last two years. In this context grant allocations to Meath in 2019 total &euro;19,676,500 which is an increase of over 45% compared to the 2017 allocation.  </p>  <p>  Allocations for 2020 will be decided in line with the annual grant allocation process. Local Authorities will be notified of allocations in early 2020. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.147.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100053#WRC00400"><p>As the Deputy is aware, as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, which includes insurance.  In this regard, both I and my predecessor, Mr Michael Noonan T.D. as Ministers for Finance, have always recognised insurance reform as a key priority for this Government.  However, we have been consistently clear that there is no quick fix solution to the current problems in the Irish market.  This is in part due to the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  In addition, a further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied. </p><p>That said, my predecessor Minister Noonan recognised that the environment within which insurers operate could be improved and consequently established the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) in 2016, which was chaired initially by then Minister of State for Financial Services, Eoghan Murphy TD.  Its purpose was to examine the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and identifying what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.  I believe that the CIWG has made a lot of progress and it is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of both of its reports.  This progress is reflected in the fact that CSO figures show motor insurance costs have decreased by 27.1% since the peak in July 2016. </p><p>Much works remain to be done and in this regard the implementation of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) benchmarking report is critical, if we are to bring award levels more into line with other jurisdictions, and thus reduce the cost of insurance and increase its availability. As the Deputy is aware the groundwork for this has been laid through the enactment of the Judicial Council Bill and once operational it will be a matter for the Judiciary to put in place new guidelines which reflect amongst other things the PIC report. </p><p>In addition, I think it is worth noting that the Minister of State&rsquo;s title includes special responsibility for Financial Services and Insurance.  When An Taoiseach announced his decision to appoint Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy to this new portfolio in June 2017, I believe that the specific reference to insurance in his portfolio demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s belief that this issue needed to be tackled by a dedicated Minister of State within the Department of Finance.  In that respect, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has taken a lead role in relation to chairing the CIWG, and as part of that role, he has held numerous meetings with relevant stakeholders, including the insurance industry and its representatives.  I believe that this has been appropriate and remains so, in light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibilities.  However, I wish to emphasise that I, as the Minister for Finance, have and will continue to play an active role in ensuring that insurance reform remains a priority for the Government.</p><p>In conclusion, I do not believe that a measure of success for any Minister for Finance is the number of meetings held with any individual sector, instead it is the progress being made towards a stated objective, in this case lower insurance costs.  While accepting that much work remains to be done, I believe strongly that tangible results have been delivered on the insurance reform front to date. In addition, the necessary framework to enable the recalibration of personal injury award levels will soon be in place and I would expect this to have a significant impact on the cost and availability of insurance.  </p><p>I am happy to provide the information requested and would refer the Deputy to the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Meetings (Minister Noonan) </th>       <th>Date </th>       <th>Location </th>       <th>Purpose </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Hogan, Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Insurance, AIGSid Sankaran, Chief Financial officer, AIGDeclan O&rsquo;Rourke, Country Manager for Ireland, AIG</td>       <td>1/12/2016</td>       <td>Department of Finance</td>       <td>Meeting with AIG following request by IDA</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meetings (Minister Donohoe) </td>       <td>Date </td>       <td>Location </td>       <td>Purpose </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kevin Thompson, CEO (Insurance Ireland)Declan Jackson, Director of Government Affairs (Insurance Ireland)Aidan Holton, International Council Chair (Insurance Ireland) and CEO (SCOR Global) </td>       <td>28/03/2018 </td>       <td>Department of Finance </td>       <td>Discussion &ndash; Implications of US tax reforms </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

bodies in relation to the Budget and Finance Bill in various forms.

I should also point out that submissions may be received by the Department outside of the pre-budget process but would nonetheless be given due consideration. For example, responses to public consultations could be considered as part of the Budget/Finance Bill process as appropriate.  These would not necessarily be included in the lists above. </p><p>Finally, I should say that I have endeavoured to give as full and accurate an answer as possible but the Deputy will appreciate that given the sheer volume of pre-budget submissions and meetings at what is an extremely busy time for my Department, some items may not have been included. It is also possible that what an organisation may consider to be a pre-budget submission may not be categorised as such by the Department, nonetheless it would have received due consideration. </p></reply>

The definition of first time buyer in HTB is as follows:</p><p><i>'first-time purchaser' means an individual who, at the time of a claim under subsection (3) has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling; </i></p><p>The intention is to target the Help to Buy scheme on those who have not had the opportunity to build up equity in another property which could be used to purchase the second or subsequent property. </p><p>The definition complements that in the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules. It should be noted that the Bank is independent in the formulation of this policy. </p><p>I do not propose amending the definition of first time buyer in HTB. </p><p>The Central Bank has advised me that it defines a first time buyer as a borrower to whom no housing loan has ever before been advanced. (Also where the borrower under a housing loan is more than one person and one or more of those persons has previously been advanced a housing loan, none of those persons is a first-time buyer for the purposes of the lending rules). However, the Central Bank also advises me that it introduced proportionate limits in it mortgage lending framework specifically to allow flexibility by lenders when assessing individual cases, such as may be the case for separated or divorced persons. The Bank's view is that the proportionate limits mean that lenders are able to make decisions based on an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances up to a specific overall limit. Nevertheless, lenders will still be required to assess an individual borrower&rsquo;s affordability and lend prudently on a case by case basis, in line with the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code and other relevant regulations.</p></reply>

The remainder of the site remains available to visit however and, as an additional service to visitors during the 2019 season, full Guided tours were made available of the entire Loughcrew landscape as opposed to simply Cairn T alone, which had been the case before access was restricted. The response to this was strongly positive and it was considered that the move added considerably to the overall depth of the visitor experience. </p>  <p>  Prior to the closure of Cairn T, offseason visitor access (i.e. in the absence of Guides) was facilitated through a local keyholder who made the key available to visitors on request. Given the level of damage which has been noted at the site, it is not at this stage clear what the future position regarding offseason access will be following the remediation works and the level of unaccompanied access that will be feasible.

The purpose of this update is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved appraisal, cost estimation and management.  I anticipate that the revised central elements of the Public Spending Code relating to the appraisal and management of public capital projects will be published in the near future following consideration and approval by Government. Further technical guidance building upon these central elements will follow in 2020. </p>  <p>  In the context of updating the Public Spending Code, my Department has given consideration to the potential benefits of more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, focusing in particular on the robustness of planned delivery, accuracy of cost forecasts, and consideration of risk.  My Department is developing a new governance and assurance process for major projects with an estimated cost of over &euro;100 million. This new process is being informed by international best practice and will involve consultation with all major public sector stakeholders. It is likely to involve an independent external review of major projects at key stages, drawing from international best practice approaches, and the modalities of such an approach in an Irish context are currently receiving careful attention. The detail of the process and arrangements for implementation will be scoped and developed with a target operational date of mid-2020.</p></reply>

The existing distribution of financial processing across Public Service Bodies (PSBs) and systems does not support the automated consolidation of data at a central level. The continued use of legacy systems could not meet existing and emerging requirements without considerable duplication of effort and at a potentially significant cost/risk to the State.</p><p>The implementation of the single FMS, aligned with the standardisation of processes across central government, will provide the necessary supporting framework, and is an essential enabler, for the financial reporting reform outlined in the 2019 OECD Report on &quot;Financial Reporting in Ireland&quot;. A single best-in-class finance technology platform will provide greater flexibility and strategic capability to respond to new and emerging requirements in a more consistent, agile and cost effective manner, while future proofing the Government&rsquo;s Finance Function. It will also provide significantly improved financial information and data insights, on a real time accruals basis, which will strengthen informed decision making across PSBs and Central Government. </p><p>The original business case anticipated that the Programme would return cost savings of some &euro;15.4m per annum once fully operational. </p><p>In addition to the projected operational cost savings, it is also important to consider that the programme negates the costs of upgrading the existing 31 legacy systems which would be significant (benchmark estimates suggest a range of &euro;50m-&euro;80m), and would not deliver the reporting reforms or rich source of centralised data available from this single FMS programme.</p><p>With respect to timelines, a decision was made in mid-2018 to pause entry into user acceptance testing and review the design of the technology platform.</p><p>I<b></b>am informed by the National Shared Services Office (NSSO) that the design review of the new financial management technology platform was completed recently. This has highlighted a number of process and technical opportunities for improvement of the single finance platform for Government.  This will ensure that the quality of the solution implemented will support the reform of public finance management and reporting. Changes are not unusual in a programme of this scale and complexity that will replace and upgrade 31 existing different systems with one new finance system for Government. </p><p>As a result of the design review, and the work to realise the improvements identified by the review, the project will not be completed by 2021 as originally planned.  This is a large scale complex programme that will take longer than originally anticipated to deliver the new system for 48 Public Service Bodies over a number of years. The timeline will be worked through in consultation with the system implementation partner and each Public Service Body.</p><p>The original Business Case recognised the level of complexity in this Programme and envisaged that the costs to support a full deployment, taking account of potential delays that were liable to arise for a system of this complexity, could range from &euro;47.4m to &euro;62.25m excluding VAT. The total amount spent to date on the project is &euro;36.5m excluding VAT. </p><p>A project of this scale and complexity requires a wide range of skills and expertise from within and outside the Civil Service. I am informed by the NSSO of the following spending on consultants, recruited to provide advice on the development of the project to date: <table>    <tr>       <th>Consultant</th>       <th>Spend to date (ex VAT)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EY</td>       <td>&euro;814,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deloitte</td>       <td>&euro;4,461,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am informed that EY was engaged by the NSSO to provide expert advice on programme governance.  The work referred to by the Deputy included a confidential (not for publication) internal review of the governance arrangements for the Programme focused on making improvements and the recommendations have been implemented.  </p><p>I am updated on matters pertaining to expenditure, including in respect of a range of organisations such as the NSSO, on an ongoing basis. A revised timetable and cost for completion of the Programme will be finalised when the consultation referred to above is completed.</p></reply>

This new Model is being piloted in 75 schools in the Kildare/Wicklow/South Dublin region in the current school year. </p><p>Key features of the School Inclusion Model are:</p><p>- Development of a new frontloaded allocation model for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) in line with their profiled need, thus breaking the link with the requirement for an assessment.</p><p>- The expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to provide a more intensive support service for pilot schools. </p><p>- The development of a National Training Programme for special needs assistants, to provide them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with additional care needs arising from significant medical, physical, emotional/behavioural, sensory, communication and other significant difficulties that pose a barrier to participating in school life.</p><p>- The development of a national nursing service for children with complex medical needs in schools to complement current provision provided through community based services.</p><p>- Establishment, on a pilot basis, of a new Regional Support service under the National Council for Special Education to include specialists in speech and language; occupational therapy and behaviour practitioners.</p><p>- The continuation of the current in-school therapy project for another year. This involves 19 Speech and Language Therapists and 12 Occupational Therapists working with and within schools. </p><p>The School Inclusion Model aims to build schools&rsquo; capacity and to provide the right supports at the right time for students with additional needs.</p><p>A comprehensive independent evaluation of the pilot will be required to test its effectiveness and provide guidance on issues to consider in any potential mainstreaming of the School Inclusion Model. </p><p>There is a number of other recommendations in relation to the training of SNAs and the development of a nursing programme for children with the most complex needs being progressed.</p></reply>

NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with clearly identified and serious difficulties.  Consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions delivered in the school setting is also available.  When counselling is considered to be required a referral is made to an outside agency.  Schools are advised to have identified appropriate referral pathways in consultation with HSE and other mental health services in their local community. NEPS helps schools in the process of making referrals to external agencies as appropriate for students who require more specialised interventions. NEPS Guidelines for Schools on Responding to Critical Incidents provide advice for schools in handling critical incidents and also advises about prevention and early intervention strategies for students at risk.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills promotes a comprehensive and whole-school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health focusing on the entire school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified need.  </p>  <p>  School guidance counselling service plays a valuable role as an integral part of the school&rsquo;s pastoral care and student support structures to promote student wellbeing at whole-school level. Every post-primary school is required to publish a whole-school guidance plan in which the school outlines how students can be supported. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  It outlines a comprehensive, whole school approach to promoting wellbeing and positive mental health.

Of this cohort who were employed 18 months post-graduation -  70% of Level 6 &amp;amp; 7 graduates, 77% of Honours Bachelor Degree (L8) graduates and 84% of taught postgraduate graduates rated the area of study as relevant to their area of employment (somewhat relevant to very relevant).  </p><p>In relation to graduate supply, in 2017 there were a total of 48,931 graduates from the Higher Education system.  Of this number, a significant proportion were in key skills areas, 2,765 were in ICT, 5,729 in Engineering Manufacturing and Construction and 4,200 in Science and Maths.  </p><p>The National Employer Survey completed in Q2 2018, has shown that employers are very satisfied with graduate recruits across a range of personal and workplace attributes, including computer and technical literacy, working effectively with others and numeracy/processing numerical data. Overall satisfaction with higher education graduates was 86% and for further education and training graduates overall satisfaction was 84%. The satisfaction with the computer and technology literacy of graduates is very high (88% for Higher Education, 83% for Further Education and Training). </p><p>I recently launched the Human Capital Initiative, the primary objective of which is to underpin the provision of additional capacity across the Higher Education Sector to meet priority skill needs for enterprise. It represents an additional investment of &euro;300m (&euro;60m per annum from 2020 to 2024) from the surplus in the National Training Fund in line with the recommendation contained in the independent review of the National Training Fund. </p><p>The HCI will also incentivise continued reform and innovation in third level provision building on best practice nationally and internationally, strongly supporting innovation in programme design and delivery. It aims to future proof graduates and ensure that there is a greater focus across the whole spectrum of Higher Education course provision on promoting and embedding transversal skills. </p><p>Priority skills will be identified though the detailed and comprehensive framework now in place under the National Skills Council, including  publications from the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), the work of the Regional Skills For a, the NTF Advisory Group, and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, and direct involvement of employers.</p><p>Technology Skills 2022: Ireland&rsquo;s Third ICT Skills Action Plan which is a collaborative effort by Government, the higher and further education and training system and industry to meet Ireland&rsquo;s high level ICT skills needs<b></b>was recently published.  The plan has devised measures that will boost the supply of ICT graduates to meet the ambitious level of demand forecast for the coming years. By 2022, the interventions outlined in this plan aim to deliver up to an additional 5,000 graduates per annum through indigenous supply, with the remainder serviced by inward migration.</p><p>I am satisfied that these and other important elements of my Departments strategies, developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, will help ensure that we are well prepared to meet our skills needs on an ongoing basis and to support the long-term success of our economy.</p></reply>

The procedures recognise that a positive school culture and climate is key and set out a very practical way on what schools must do to both prevent bullying and to deal with bullying when it occurs.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the schools complaints procedures.</p>  <p>  Also in accordance with procedures, in the event that a parent has exhausted the schools complaints procedures and is still not satisfied, the school must advise the parents of their right to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures. A template policy is provided in the procedures to help facilitate schools in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Board of Management must ensure that the school has clear procedures for the formal noting and reporting of bullying behaviour and these must be documented in the schools&rsquo; anti-bullying policy.</p>  <p>  The procedures for schools include important oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti-bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, as part of its whole-school evaluation inspections of schools, specifically examines schools&rsquo; compliance with the anti-bullying procedures including the actions taken to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying. Typically, in the course of whole-school evaluations, inspectors review the school&rsquo;s code of behaviour and anti-bullying policy (including evidence of the principal&rsquo;s report to the board of management on incidents of bullying and evidence of an annual review of the policy.) Where inspectors encounter non-compliance with the anti-bullying procedures relevant findings are included in whole-school evaluation reports published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In the course of their whole-school inspection work, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate gathers information about how schools deal with bullying in a number of ways through:</p>  <p>  - Review of relevant school documentation, including the school&rsquo;s Code of Behaviour and Anti-Bullying policy;</p>  <p>  - Meetings with parents and student representatives at which there is an opportunity for parents and students to raise issues where relevant and</p>  <p>  - The inclusion of parent and student Questionnaires on items relating to bullying. </p>  <p>  Students and parents are also asked to respond to questions about how the school deals with bullying and discipline in the school and whether or not the school provides a safe environment for children. </p>  <p>  Where responses indicate that students and/or parent do not believe that bullying is dealt with effectively, inspectors raise this issue with school management who have ultimate responsibility for anti-bullying policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  Inspection models for evaluating SPHE and for whole-school evaluations (WSEs) have been adapted to include more evidence gathering concerning the effectiveness of the school's actions to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate has, since February 2019, been conducting in-depth inspections of the implementation of child protection procedures in schools.  During those Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections, inspectors check if the minutes of board of management meetings contain a record of a child protection oversight report being provided in line with the requirements of the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 and if, in the case of child protection concerns arising from alleged bullying behaviour amongst pupils, the board is provided with relevant documents for its consideration in line with the 2017 Procedures.</p></reply>

This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school  or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022) including a new 500 pupil post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Kilcock school planning area to be located in Enfield which, it is anticipated, will have the effect of reducing pressure on the existing post-primary school in Kilcock. </p>  <p>  This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.  </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040 may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  In relation to the school to which the Deputy refers I have approved a project under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme 2018.  This project will provide for 9 Mainstream classrooms, 9 WC's, 1 Assisted Users WC, 2 Science Labs and Prep Area, and 1 x 119m2 Arts &amp;amp; Crafts Room.</p>  <p>  This project has been devolved for delivery to the school authority. It is a matter for the Board of Management to advance this project in that context.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.

The FSD was extended in 2018 to cover students studying on a part-time basis;</p>  <p>  -  Students can also apply for financial support through the Student Assistance Fund (SAF); </p>  <p>  -  The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) has allocated a number of 1916 Bursaries to NAP target groups such as students with disabilities and students who wish to undertake their studies on a part-time basis.</p>  <p>  All eligible undergraduate students are covered by the Free Fees Initiative whereby the State provides funding towards tuition fees for students undertaking approved courses in eligible institutions. Under the rules of the initiative, tuition fees are not paid in respect of students undertaking a repeat year of study at the same level. However, this condition may be waived where there is evidence of exceptional circumstances, such as cases of certified serious illness. Decisions in such cases are made at a local level in each higher education institution in line with the criteria of the scheme. A similar approach applies in respect of grant support.  In this regard, SUSI cannot extend funding past the normal duration of the course which is set out by the institutions themselves, unless the applicant is repeating the same year of a course under exceptional circumstances.</p></reply>

Schools should examine their own assessment policies and must plan for the replacement of in-house examinations with Classroom-Based Assessments for students, where relevant.</p>  <p>  It has been longstanding SEC policy, and DES policy (prior to the establishment of the SEC), to provide sample papers in the autumn of the examination year for the programme in question.  </p>  <p>  This to allow the curricular changes, and the associated changes to teaching and learning to become embedded. This is supported by the programme of continuous professional development that is specifically focussed on the systemic curricular and pedagogical changes involved. </p>  <p>  To introduce the specifics of the final assessment at any earlier point in the process would distract from this fundamental requirement to focus on the teaching, learning processes, and content aspects of the curricular change.  The consequence of acceding to requests for earlier publication of sample papers would result in an examinations focus too early in the change process, rather than on the curriculum content, and critically on the teaching and learning processes. This is particularly important in the context of Junior Cycle Reform, which is promoting a very different approach to assessment and feedback to students to assist their learning over the course of Junior Cycle, away from the traditional focus on external terminal assessment through the state examinations. </p></reply>

The patron indicated significant parental interest in relation to enrolments for 2020.</p>  <p>  -  A new 8 classroom primary school to serve the Dunshaughlin school planning area - the patron of the new school advised that there are currently no enrolments for the 2019/20 school year and that the opening of the school has been deferred from September 2019.  The patron body expects enrolments from a new local housing development which has been delayed in the area and they have received significant interest for September 2020 enrolments for the new school.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with the patrons of these schools. In addition, in the context of further strengthening the demographic analysis process, the Department intends to have additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements.</p></reply>

This will provide increased choices for students, an enhanced student experience and greater access for potential students tackling educational disadvantage with TUs offering a broad range of teaching from apprenticeship to doctoral degrees. They will also support an increased intensity of research activity which will provide increased opportunities for collaboration with industry and deliver benefits for the economy and wider society. TUs will marry both an attractive physical multi-campus presence with state-of-the-art digital connectivity, providing new modes of learning where the student and learner is placed centre-stage and can access course content and avail of first-class tuition irrespective of location or circumstance. Each TU will serve as an anchor institution in the development and advancement of its region. Drawing frontier technological developments to regions through intensive collaboration, engagement with and connectedness to national and international researchers will be fundamental to TUs acting as regional knowledge hubs. These hubs will, in turn, act as major catalysts for further direct investment, research, innovation and employment growth.</p>  <p>  On 18 October I announced &euro;14.25 million in funding to Higher Education Institutions under the HEA 2019 call for submissions for higher education landscape restructuring, consolidation and collaborative projects. The majority of this investment, &euro;11.8 million, is aimed at progressing the creation and expansion of TUs. The Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA), comprising the Galway Mayo, Letterkenny and Sligo Institutes of Technology, was allocated &euro;2 million under this call bringing total Exchequer funding to date for their project to &euro;5.92 million. In total since 2013 some &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding has been invested in TU creation and development.</p>  <p>  Launched earlier this month, the report of the high level working group, the TU Research Network (TURN), entitled &lsquo;Technological Universities: Connectedness &amp;amp; Collaboration enabled by Connectivity&rsquo; sets out the case for a state change in higher education reform for the delivery of national strategic priorities such as are elaborated in Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland. This state change is to be achieved through the connectedness, particularly at regional level, collaboration and connectivity of TUs and their unique delivery of programmes across the full range of the National Framework of Qualifications. The report makes a series of 12 recommendations for outcomes that will provide TUs with a solid foundation for their development. These centre upon three thematic areas identified by TURN as the essential building blocks for successful TUs : - </p>  <p>  -  investment in integrated multi-campus digital infrastructure to provide regional cohesion and to facilitate new modes of learning and the prioritisation of capital investment in TUs; </p>  <p>  -  investment in research capacity building by developing researcher human capital, facilitating research activity and opportunities for existing academic staff and implementing a researcher career development and employment framework, addressing infrastructural deficits and prioritising research strategies within TUs, exploiting fully the mutually supporting roles of teaching and research; and</p>  <p>  -  re-alignment of the policy framework and funding for TUs including an expansion of institutional autonomy and reform through the implementation of TU-apposite career structures, the reform of the grant allocation model to accommodate TUs, the creation of a dedicated TU funding stream including in the post-establishment phase and the creation of a borrowing framework for TUs. </p>  <p>  The report recognises that relevant priority actions can only be achieved through a structured, system-wide, relevant and dynamic process that will ensure value for money, underpinned by a robust and evidence-based set of monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The TURN report can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website </p>  <p>  As announced during Budget 2020 and in response to the TURN report the Government is providing &euro;90 million over the next three years under a new TU Transformation Fund to support consortia such as CUA to achieve TU designation and to support the further advancement of established TUs. </p>  <p>  The TURN report and the ongoing work of the group, whose remit is being extended, will continue to be of considerable assistance and benefit to consortia such as the CUA towards achieving TU designation, as will access to the new TU Transformation Fund being developed currently in consultation with TURN. </p>  <p>  As such further TU creation, establishment and progression will be achieved by the relevant stakeholders delivering on the TURN report recommendations and the transformational multi-annual funding underpinning such delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department met with the Presidents and Chairs of the IoTs involved in the CUA in recent weeks in relation to TU related system-wide issues and to support and encourage the consortium in the progression of their TU development proposals. However, ultimately it remains a matter for a consortium to lead on the progression of their plans to seek TU designation under the Technological Universities Act 2018 and to ensure that they have a shared unitary vision and purpose for TU development and can demonstrate compliance with the relevant eligibility criteria and related legislative requirements prescribed in the 2018 Act. </p>  <p>  In this context it is understood from the recent discussion that an application by the consortium is anticipated to be made by CUA in the latter half of 2020.</p></reply>

The objective of the Working Group has been to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs.It has published two key reports with recommendations &ndash; one on the Cost of Motor Insurance (2017) and the other on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance (2018).  </p><p>To date and on foot of these reports the Government has taken a substantial number actions including: </p><p>-New Guidelines for the Reporting of Allegations of Fraudulent Insurance Claims to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were published on 1 October 2018.</p><p>-A new insurance claim fraud category on the Garda PULSE system went live on 2 November 2018, enabling the production of better statistics. </p><p>-The Personal Injuries Commission was established in January 2017 and presented two reports of its own over an 18-month work programme. </p><p>-The Personal Injuries Commission recommended that the future Judicial Council be assigned the function of compiling guidelines for general damages for personal injury.

This new operating model has been implemented in the Department to create a better platform for the professional delivery of services. </p>  <p>  My Department's work was previously structured by subject areas relating to different parts of the Justice and Equality sector. Cosc - The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence was an example of this.  By contrast, the Department is now divided into two pillars- Criminal Justice and Civil Justice and Equality. Within these pillars, the Department is divided into structured into four functional areas:  Policy development, Governance, Legislation, Operations &amp;amp; Service Delivery.  Support is provided across the pillars by Corporate and Transparency.</p>  <p>  In terms of the work previously carried out by Cosc, the reorganised Department model means that specialist teams will now focus on specific functions relating to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The work that was carried out by Cosc will be distributed under the new model in the following way: </p>  <p>  Policy Function (Community Safety) will take over many of the responsibilities Cosc previously held. This Division will be the contact point for NGOs for issues such as the monitoring and implementation of the second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence. This Division will be engaged with the development of Policy to determine requirements and challenges facing the domestic, sexual and gender based violence sector. </p>  <p>  Governance Function will be responsible for overseeing the actions of criminal justice agencies in implementing the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Legislation Function will be responsible for actions such as any proposed amendments to the Domestic Violence Act 2018.</p>  <p>  Operations and Service Delivery Function will make decisions on funding, through a centralised Funding Administration team, to support best practice and centralised oversight of NGO funding.</p>  <p>  Transparency will be responsible for actions such as the national awareness raising campaign under the second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence.</p>  <p>  My Department has had a number of meetings with NGOs who work in the area, bilaterally and in larger groups, to discuss the Transformation programme. This has been done to ensure that they are appraised of the changes, personally are introduced to the new points of contact for individual functions and to ensure that a seamless customer service is provided.</p>  <p>  The benefits of the new model include that the Department is in a better position to deliver on its strategic objectives.  More clearly defined roles and responsibilities will mean improved accountability and services will be delivered in a better, streamlined way. Information will be shared with stakeholders and the public in a proactive way, through the dedicated Transparency function. </p>  <p>  I am confident that with these changes, my Department has embarked on building a new and better model for the Civil Service and that the important issues within our responsibility, including in relation to tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, will be handled in an even better way in future. </p></reply>

I would point out however that my actions in relation to the O'Farrell case are and must be carried out in accordance with the law.</p><p>The terms of reference for the scoping exercise were focused, as required by the law in particular the line of jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court in <i>Shatter v Guerin</i>, to reduce the risk of legal challenge to its recommendations. The judgment requires the terms of reference of a scoping exercise to be as specific as possible to remove potential ambiguity and focused enough to promote a timely outcome to ensure fairness to all parties. However they still allow for review of the issues intended.  </p><p>Further, Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendation he sees fit in his final report, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry. It is also the case that the O&rsquo;Farrell family is free to make any representations they wish to Judge Haughton in relation to any matter they wish to see inquired into, in any future inquiry. Should Judge Haughton recommend an inquiry, of whatever type, he has been asked to provide draft terms of reference for such an inquiry.</p><p>I welcome the fact that the O&rsquo;Farrell family has decided to work with Judge Haughton and to supply him with the documentation they have. </p><p>While the process has taken some time, a clear process is now in place and it should be permitted to continue in accordance with the law and without the delay or additional risk of confusion which would arise if there were interference with the ongoing work of Judge Haughton. </p><p>Judge Haughton has submitted his initial report to me and this has been shared with the O'Farrell family. I intend to publish that initial report shortly, following consultation with the Attorney General.</p><p>Judge Haughton has committed to producing his final report in the coming months and the O&rsquo;Farrell family is working with his scoping exercise to ensure that all the facts are fully considered and that recommendations are made to address this tragic case.  I would ask Deputies to appreciate that I cannot and should not prejudge Judge Haughton&rsquo;s report or change his terms of reference in a way that doesn&rsquo;t comply with the law. </p></reply>

For the purposes of Irish law, the mother of a child is the person who gives birth to the child or a female adopter of the child. In general, the father is the person identified as the genetic father of the child or a male adopter.</p>  <p>  Section 7, of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended addresses citizenship by descent and provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen. However, an additional requirement of registration is imposed in respect of children born outside the State of Ireland where the Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and specifically the passport service, is tasked with processing passport applications in line with the requirements of the Passports Act 2008. The Passport Act 2008, sets out the legislative framework within which the passport service processes all applications for passports. Pursuant to section 7 of the Passport Act 2008, a passport cannot be issued unless the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is satisfied the person is an Irish citizen and is also satisfied as to the identity of the person. </p>  <p>  Therefore, under the current Irish law, Section 7, of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 does not apply, where the Irish citizen is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father or neither the male nor female adopter of the child. Consequently, the child does not qualify for Irish citizenship by descent and therefore does not qualify for the granting of an Irish passport.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which provide for parentage of children born through donor-assisted human reproduction, will come into operation on 4 May 2020, as provided for by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Parts 2 and 3) (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. No. 541 of 2019) recently made by the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  Where a child is born in the State through donor-assisted human reproduction prior to the commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act, depending on the particular circumstances, it may be possible after Parts 2 and 3 come into operation for a couple to seek a declaration under section 21 of the Act that the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the birth mother is the other parent of the child (with all of the parental responsibilities that entails), and ultimately to have a new birth certificate issued reflecting that legal parentage.  However, it is important to note that Parts 2 and 3 of the Act will only apply to children born in the State.</p>  <p>  In light of the evolving situation relating to recognition of domestic births, and noting the very complex legal matters involved, I have asked my officials to consult with colleagues in other relevant Departments with the view to seeking an appropriate solution in relation to births that take place abroad. </p></reply>

This process has involved my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTAS), Housing, Planning and Local Government and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of local authorities.  </p>  <p>  On foot of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, it was agreed by all attendees at the last formal meeting of the group in March 2019 that, in the main, current legislative provisions appeared to be sufficient. Nonetheless it was also agreed that the group would remain open to considering workable legislative solutions to any specific legislative gaps specifically identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  My officials wrote to the Garda Commissioner to seek his formal views on the matter. A response was received on 28 June and has since been shared with DTTAS, as a primary contributor to the work of the cross-agency group. The response from the Office of the Garda Commissioner does suggest potential legislative changes which the organisation believes could assist in improving policing in this area. </p>  <p>  These proposals are receiving detailed consideration in my Department, and have been shared with our colleagues in DTTAS who have responsibility for road traffic legislation.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently in the process of reconvening the cross-agency group &ndash; proposed for early December &ndash; where the Garda proposals will be further scrutinised to ascertain whether they can be progressed alongside targeted enforcement measures, awareness raising and youth engagement, which are key to success in combatting this behaviour.</p>  <p>  However I would stress that work and engagement on these issues continues on an ongoing basis between the relevant Departments and officials, between formal meetings.</p></reply>

In Ireland's case, this is an increase on 44% in 2016.</p><p>28% of Ireland's population meanwhile have above basic digital skills, a figure that also refers to 2017, and which compares to an EU average of 31%. For Ireland this is also an increase on the 2016 level of 25%.</p><p>The importance of digital skills to the future of Ireland's workforce is recognised in the Government's <i>Future Jobs Ireland</i>, which aims to help prepare Ireland for the economy of tomorrow. Technological advances and the transition to the low carbon economy present challenges but also numerous opportunities as our businesses and workers learn to operate in a changed economy. </p><p>In addition to support from Government to exploit these opportunities, investment by enterprises to innovate is required and our people will also need to learn new skills. The enhancement of digital skills will be core to the vision set out in <i>Future Jobs Ireland</i>, which includes efforts to embrace innovation and technological change and the improvement of SME productivity.</p><p>One of the key targets set out in <i>Future Jobs Ireland </i>is to increase the share of the population with basic or above basic digital skills from its 2017 baseline of 48%, to equal or greater than the EU average by 2025. This is complemented by an ambition to double Ireland's lifelong learning rate from a 2017 baseline of 8.9% to 18% by 2025.</p><p>The means by which these targets will be realised are set out under pillar 3 of <i>Future Jobs</i>, on enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent- the majority of these initiatives will be progressed by the Department of Education and Skills and its agencies. </p><p>These include the development of digital literacy curricula at school level, the implementation of Upskilling Pathways- New Opportunities for Adults, the Skills to Advance and EXPLORE upskilling programmes for lower skilled workers, the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship offerings, Springboard+ courses in new technologies, Skillnet Ireland training provision in digital skills development and emerging technologies, and the roll out of the new Human Capital Initiative within the Higher Education sector.</p><p>These initiatives are in turn being supported through reforms to the National Training Fund, to align it more directly with the changing skills requirements of the Irish labour force. </p><p>Other commitments in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 complement these initiatives and recognise the role that employers have in supporting the upskilling of employees. Future Jobs Ireland 2020 will build on these commitments and introduce additional actions which will result in further progress in this area.</p></reply>

Appointments in respect of new or vacant GMS posts are made through open competition following advertisement and competitive interview. Periodically, challenges can be experienced in regard to the permanent filling of some GP posts. In areas where this challenge is experienced, every effort is made by local HSE management to ensure the provision of GP services to all GMS patients. </p>  <p>  The HSE has repeatedly advertised the GMS list of 380 patients in an effort to put in place a permanent GP to serve the practice.  However, the financial viability of a practice of this size is a challenge for GPs and it has not been possible to find a replacement.</p>  <p>   As a result of this, the HSE wrote to the GMS patients served by this practice in early November 2019 advising them that the practice would close in December 2019 and providing them with information on how to find an alternative GP.</p>  <p>  In light of the community reaction to this announcement, Cork Kerry Community Healthcare held a meeting with the local community and public representatives on Monday November 18 to listen to local concerns and to discuss any possible additional measures that could be taken to attract a GP to the GMS contract in Milltown.  Cork Kerry Community Healthcare has also postponed the closure of the practice to early 2020 to provide time to the local community to work on possible additional measures.</p></reply>

It is use administered for the treatment of known or suspected narcotic overdose.</p>  <p>  However, under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended (S.I. No. 540 of 2003), trained, non-medical persons, employed or engaged by a listed organisation, are enabled to administer certain prescription&ndash;only medicines to a person, without a prescription, for the purpose of saving their life or reducing severe distress in an emergency situation. The specific emergency medicines are listed in the Tenth Schedule to the Regulations and include intra-muscular and intranasal naloxone preparations following amendments introduced in 2018.</p>  <p>  Listed organisations can include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Fire Service, prisons, schools, sports clubs and community groups. In order for an organisation to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, members of that organisation must complete an approved course of training regarding the administration of such medicines and the management of any adverse reaction. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) has established a framework for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer these medicines to those urgently requiring care. </p>  <p>  While PHECC approve these training courses, the decision to undertake the training lies solely with the organisation that wishes to gain approval under the Regulations to administer one of the scheduled medicines.</p>  <p>  It is important to note however that notwithstanding the above, there is an existing and long-standing practice whereby any person may administer or assist in the administration of a person&rsquo;s personally prescribed medicine for the purpose of saving their life or reducing severe distress in an emergency situation. If a person has been prescribed a medicine, but is unable to administer it to themselves, such as in the case of an overdose, there is no legal impediment to another person administering that medicine to the patient.</p></reply>

The National Maternity Strategy, published in January 2016, reaffirms this commitment. In this context, the Rotunda Hospital will be relocated to the Connolly Hospital campus. Co-location will facilitate the provision of an appropriate environment within all our maternity hospitals and units to enable the delivery of a modern, safe, quality service where the woman&rsquo;s need for privacy and dignity is respected. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the new children's hospital was originally planned for the Mater site and it was proposed, as recommended in the KPMG report (Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin Area) 2008,  to redevelop the Rotunda Hospital on the Mater site. However, following the Government decision in 2012 to locate the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the St James&rsquo;s campus, it was necessary to revisit the earlier decisions regarding the relocation of both the Rotunda and the Coombe Women and Infants University hospitals.  </p>  <p>  A detailed review was undertaken by my Department, which considered a number of potential host sites for both hospitals, examining demographics, a range of clinical criteria as well as planning risks and site capacity. The Department engaged with a number of divisions within the HSE and with the Masters of both the Rotunda and the Coombe as part of the review process.  In June 2015 Government decided that the Coombe would be relocated to the St James's Hospital campus, while the Rotunda would be redeveloped on the Connolly Hospital campus.</p>  <p>  More recently I have also engaged with the Master of the Rotunda, the RCSI Hospital Group and the HSE in relation to the relocation of the Rotunda to Connolly, including meeting with these parties in July of this year. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including funding to support implementation of the National Maternity Strategy. The relocation of the Rotunda Hospital to the Connolly campus is one of the key infrastructure projects which will be funded under Project Ireland 2040. It is important that we carefully plan all projects to meet population health needs and achieve value for money. This work is ongoing.  While I am not in position to outline the year on year provisions for any individual maternity hospital project at this stage, this will be considered through the process of the determination of service priorities and in the context of Health capital planning.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Rotunda relocation project is at an early stage and will be required to progress through appraisal, planning, design and tender before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. However, the Project Briefs for the relocation of the three stand alone maternity hospitals, namely the Rotunda, the Coombe and University Maternity Hospital Limerick, to acute hospital campuses, in line with the National Maternity Review will be progressed in 2020.</p></reply>

The Minister met with Prof Malone and other representatives from the Rotunda Hospital, the RCSI Hospital Group, as well as the HSE in July 2019 to discuss potential interim works at the hospital. </p>  <p>  The Minister asked that further consideration be given to the scope of the works necessary to address the infrastructural challenges, having regard to the plan to relocate the Rotunda to the Connolly Hospital campus. It was agreed that further engagement on a proposal was required across the HSE, and with the Rotunda. A revised and evaluated proposal is awaited from the HSE. </p>  <p>  While the Minister recognises that some infrastructural development will be necessary at the Rotunda Hospital in the interim period, as Deputies will be aware, in line with Government policy to co-locate maternity services with acute adult services, the Rotunda Hospital will be relocated to Connolly Hospital. Co-location is considered international best practice and will best facilitate the provision of an appropriate environment within all our maternity hospitals and units. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country. The relocation of the Rotunda Hospital to the Connolly campus is one of the key infrastructure projects which will be funded under Project Ireland 2040. In addition, the recently published HSE Capital Plan 2019 provides that the project brief for the redevelopment of the Rotunda will be progressed.  </p>  <p>  In a letter from mid-May 2019 relating to the infrastructural challenges at the Rotunda Hospital, Prof. Malone notified the Minister of an infectious outbreak involving ESBL-producing Klebsiella (a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics) and the risk to infants at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). </p>  <p>  Upon being notified of this outbreak, the Department of Health&rsquo;s immediate priority was for the welfare of the infants affected by the outbreak and the safe care of all infants at the Rotunda NICU. Consequently, the Department immediately sought assurances from the Hospital that safe and appropriate care was being provided to infants cared for at the NICU. In addition, the Department sought information regarding the immediate and medium-term actions being taken by the Hospital and Hospital Group to address the outbreak.</p>  <p>  The hospital assured the Department that international best practice for managing infectious outbreaks has been followed by the hospital. The hospital also stated that an extensive action plan including both clinical and operational measures has been implemented to address the outbreak situation. </p>  <p>   Antimicrobial resistance and the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections continue to be a significant priority for the Government of Ireland. Indeed, significant progress has already been made in implementing Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (known as iNAP) and this work continues.</p></reply>

The Agreement will see an increase in expenditure of &euro;210 million annually by 2023 on GP services, with specific increases in supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.

Notwithstanding the fact that consultant numbers in Ireland are low by international standards they continue to increase each year. At the end of September 2019 there were 3,190 whole time equivalent consultants working in the public health services. The number has increased by 125 in the 12 months to the end of September and by over 550 in the past 5 years. While it is not ideal, the majority of consultant posts not filled on a permanent basis are filled by locums or temporary staff to support the delivery of essential services. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware that there are difficulties in filling certain consultant posts, particularly in smaller hospitals and in certain specialties, as identified by the Public Sector Pay Commission. The Commission in its Report published in September 2018 identified difficulties in attracting consultant applications for many posts at present and acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this. The Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential. </p>  <p>   More recently, I published the Report of the De Buitl&eacute;ir Group in August.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system.  The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.Application 2 is for the use of ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 25 September 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.</p>  <p>  On 14 November 2019, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product siponimod (Mayzent), intended for the treatment of adult patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) with active disease. The EMA's decision on whether to grant marketing authorisation for siponimod will take into account CHMP's recommendation.</p>  <p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner. My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p>  <p>  I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p></reply>

My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE this year to identify mitigating actions to bring down trolley numbers and waiting times in the ED in the face of growing demand.</p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan was launched on Thursday 14 November. The aim of the Winter Plan is to ensure that service providers are prepared for the additional external pressures associated with the winter period, including the prolonged holiday period, severe winter weather, seasonal influenza, and the spread of norovirus and other healthcare associated infections.</p>  <p>  Nine Winter Action Teams, each aligned to a Community Healthcare Organisation and associated acute hospitals and Hospital Groups, have prepared Integrated Winter Plans. These plans focus on demand management and reduction, staffing availability, timely access to the most appropriate care pathway for patients, and appropriate timely discharge from acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Integrated Winter Plan for Sligo University Hospital will be delivered by Winter Action Team 1 (WAT 1), whose membership includes the CEO of the Saolta University Health Care Group, the Chief Officer of CHO 1, and the CEO of Sligo University Hospital. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan is supported by an additional &euro;26m in winter funding nationally. This winter funding will support access to the Fair Deal scheme, and will provide additional home support and transitional care to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion in EDs over the winter period.</p>  <p>  Specific funding has been allocated to the Winter Action Teams to support initiatives at local level. The initiatives for WAT 1 include:  </p>  <p>  - added Medical Registrar for improved medical cover; </p>  <p>  - rapid flu testing to reduce turnaround time to 2 hours; </p>  <p>  - additional cleaning services to improve bed turnaround time out-of-hours; </p>  <p>  - a reablement programme to decrease presentations and admissions; </p>  <p>  - additional aids and appliances to facilitate timely discharge; and </p>  <p>  - hospital avoidance measures to reduce the number of patients admitted for assessment.</p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects and has advised that preliminary design work and site investigations have been carried out for the proposed new ward block development and additional bed capacity at Sligo University Hospital. Planning approval was granted in July 2019 and the project is currently at the detailed design stage. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, including detailed appraisal, planning, design and procurement, before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established. The final decision to proceed with the construction of a project cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal delivers value for money and remains affordable, and that sufficient funding is available to fund the project to completion, including equipping and commissioning costs. The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.</p></reply>

A successful and well attended stakeholder consultation was held in November 2018. The Health Research Board - Collaboration in Ireland for Clinical Effectiveness Reviews (HRB-CICER) has completed an Evidence Review of Specialist Cardiac Services looking at (i) international standards for PCI centres (ii) international models that might be applicable to the Irish Healthcare system and (iii) the relationship between volume and patient outcomes for PCI. The Evidence Review has provided important guidance for the Steering Group thus far and arising from discussions at the Steering Group they have been asked to complete one additional evidence review question which they have now completed and submitted to the National Review for comments and observations.  Site visits to Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) centres  around Ireland commenced earlier this year and an international site visit to Glasgow is currently being organised. These site visits have included meetings with stakeholders in clinical, administrative, nursing and allied health professional roles. A visit to Northern Ireland was also undertaken to  review the work of the Belfast Hospital Trust. </p>  <p>  An additional workstream is being undertaken by the Health Intelligence Unit of the HSE with regards to Geospatial analysis and mapping of networks of cardiac services from a national perspective and a draft has been submitted to the National Review for comment and observations. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on preparation of the National Review and the Chair is hoping to have the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services completed as soon as all streams of work have been completed. </p></reply>

The original proposals from the EU Commission were quite severe and would have had a significant negative impact on Irish farmers. The original draft proposals included:</p>  <p>  - 12 month minimum TB restriction period</p>  <p>  - Prohibition on any inward/outward movement in restricted herds</p>  <p>  - Derestriction only to occur following two clear tests 6 months apart</p>  <p>  - Compulsory 30-day pre/post movement test in ALL cases</p>  <p>  During the negotiation of the legal text, my officials engaged intensively with Commission counterparts and experts from other Member States on this issue. Ireland was successful in achieving considerable changes to the draft TB regulations to the benefit of Irish farmers in negotiations on all points but one - which though modified did not fully meet our requests. </p>  <p>  The current draft text retains the 30 day pre/post movement test requirement, however only where the animal and the herd of origin have not been tested in the last 6 months. My officials had proposed the introduction of risk-based pre/post movement testing, supported by peer-reviewed scientific research undertaken in Ireland. Our analysis shows that this approach would be more effective than across-the-board pre/post movement testing. There has been very limited support from other Member States for our position. </p>  <p>  Ireland has approximately 2.2 million movements (counting farm-to-farm and farm-to-mart-to-farm each as one movement for these purposes) per year - not all of these existing movements would have been affected by the proposed measures. The new rule would mean that these movements would have to either take place within 6 months of the herd test, or the herdowner (buyer or seller) would have to have a pre/post movement test carried out</p></reply>

Part of the remit of the Strategy Group was to consider the case for a possible re-opening of the Organic Farming Scheme. They recommended that it should be re-opened but on a targeted basis. The areas targeted were areas for which there is a clear market demand, and which are critical to the further development of the Organic Sector, namely horticulture, cereals and dairy.  This recommendation acknowledged that the budget was very limited given the success of the current scheme and the overall spending within the RDP.</p><p>The targeted Organic Farming Scheme re-opened on the 19 November 2018 and closed for applications on 19 December 2018.

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. </p>  <p>  One important element is the new delivery model, which originally required Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan covering Pillar I and Pillar II expenditure to the Commission for approval before 1 January 2020. However, given the typically challenging nature of the discussions on the CAP and the EU Budget post-2020, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals. </p>  <p>  As a result, the European Commission has recently published its proposals for transitional measures to allow for continuity between programming periods of 2014-2020 and 2021-2027 for CAP payments. The draft proposals provide for an additional, transitional year before starting the new CAP, which would require Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plans to the Commission for approval by 1 January 2021. The proposals will be discussed by Member States over the coming months, and my officials are currently assessing their content.  </p>  <p>  I am open to working with the new delivery model and welcome the move to a more strategic, performance-based approach.  However, this new framework must be based on a system which provides simplification for all.   </p>  <p>  The development of the draft CAP Strategic Plan will be a complex process, involving a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design, an ex-ante evaluation including a Strategic Environmental Assessment, and an Appropriate Assessment. </p>  <p>  A key element of the development of the Plan is regular stakeholder and public consultation.  My Department has held a series of external stakeholder events, public consultations and public meetings since January 2018.  In addition, in May 2019, I established a national CAP Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which meets regularly as the CAP negotiations evolve. In September, I launched a public consultation on the SWOT analysis, and as part of this process, my Department hosted a series of &lsquo;townhall&rsquo; events in Mitchelstown, Sligo and Portlaoise, as well as a stakeholder workshop in Tullamore. The next stage of formal consultation is under consideration and its timing will be related to the progress of the discussions on the proposals.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will continue to engage with relevant stakeholders and interest groups through existing forums and structures to update them on the progress of discussions and to hear their views.</p></reply>

It is proposed that EU payments will be subject to a common baseline of conditionality with a number of requirements for good agriculture and environmental conditions for land.  In Pillar I, an eco scheme, which would be mandatory for Member States to offer, but voluntary for farmers, is provided for.  I support the provision of eco schemes.  However, at this stage, it is too early to say how such a scheme, or other environmental schemes, might be configured. </p>  <p>  The Commission proposals require 40% of the total CAP budget, at EU level, to be dedicated to environmental and climate actions.  Member States must ensure that 30% of Pillar II funding - excluding funding for Areas of Natural Constraint - will be devoted to the environment and climate change.  </p>  <p>  I firmly support the principle that there must be a high level of environmental ambition in the CAP post-2020. I believe that the economic development of the agri-food sector goes hand-in-hand with the need for environmental sustainability.  However, it is essential that the proposed new environmental conditionality is implemented effectively, with common standards that are relevant and effective. It is also important that the overall level of the budget acknowledges the public goods being delivered by farmers. </p>  <p>  My key priority remains to continue to press for agreement on the CAP reform proposals and on the maintenance of the CAP budget as part of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2020 period. I will continue to work at building consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe in this regard. </p></reply>

Both tests are employed to maximise the efficacy of the TB eradication scheme. As in testing for any disease in any animal, there are a wide range of factors that impact on tests. These include duration of infection, level of immune response, age of animal, virulence of infection, settings of test, etc. Individual infected animals will react to various different tests in slightly different ways. This is normal and to be expected. </p><p>Less than 1 in 5,000 skin reactors are false reactors. Being able to see, with the naked eye, evidence of infection in animals after death is typically possible in approximately one third of reactors. This is not a verification of the skin test as it is a poorer test than the skin test.  </p><p>My Department has produced leaflets and videos to explain how the tests work and what to expect from them.  These are available on my Departments website at .</p></reply>

Suckler farmers also benefit, of course, from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p><p>In 2019, a further &euro;20 million of exchequer funding was made available through the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme, to encourage farmers to measure the weaning efficiency of their suckler cows.  <b></b></p><p>And, of course, the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) has provided temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. </p><p>BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty. Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of almost &euro;78 million.</p><p>In recognition of the important income support role played by the ANC scheme, the total allocation for the scheme has been increased by &euro;48m over the last two budgets (&euro;25m in Budget 2018 and &euro;23m in Budget 2019). In both 2018 and 2019, payment rates in the scheme were increased, with a targeting of increases corresponding to the different level of constraint in the different categories of land in the scheme.</p><p>In Budget 2020, I have provided almost &euro;85 million in targeted schemes to support sustainable beef farming. This includes almost &euro;45 million for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), and a further &euro;40 million for targeted supports. I intend to consult with stakeholders as to the use of these funds.  </p><p>In addition, in the event of a No-Deal Brexit, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed in Budget 2020 that a Brexit contingency fund of &euro;650 million will be available to support our most vulnerable sectors, to be activated in tranches as the full impacts emerge. &euro;110 million will be made available through my Department in the first tranche, of which &euro;85 million will be provided in immediate supports for beef farmers. This will, of course, be supplemented by any exceptional aid provided from the EU under the CMO regulation. </p></reply>

Afforestation;</p><p>2. Forest road works;</p><p>3. Aerial fertilisation;</p><p>4. Tree felling.</p><p>Applications for the first three operations must be made through a registered forester.  Applicants do not require a forester to apply for a tree felling licence.  My Department uses an online application system, to which foresters have access.  The system contains extensive mapping layers enabling the location for the proposed site, along with other spatial information.</p><p><i>Reference Material and Guidelines</i></p><p>The application process is underpinned by various reference documents, which combined with information circulars are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The main document is the <i>Forestry Standards Manual</i>.  This manual complements, and should be read in conjunction with, <i>Land Types for Afforestation</i>, <i>Environmental Requirements for Afforestation</i>, <i>Irish National Forest Standard</i>, the <i>Code of Best Forest Practice &ndash; Ireland, Standards for Felling and Reforestation</i>and other guidance published by my Department.  </p><p><i>Required Documentation</i></p><p>Certain documentation, depending on the licence required, must be submitted with the application.  An application form, site location map, certified species map and biodiversity maps are <i>inter alia</i>required for afforestation.  Other documents will be required, registered foresters will be familiar with the requirements for the application.</p><p><i>Procedures</i></p><p>The application is submitted, and administrative officials will check to ensure it is complete.  The application will be advertised on my Department&rsquo;s website and submissions from interested parties invited.  At the same time, it is forwarded to a Forestry District Inspector and where required, the application is referred to certain prescribed bodies.  The prescribed bodies include statutory consultees such as the local authority, National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), Inland Fisheries Ireland and/or An Taisce.  30 days is provided for public consultation and no decision may issue before that time.  Where NPWS is consulted, that time is extended to a minimum of eight weeks. </p><p>If built heritage or archaeological monuments are recorded or found within or proximate to a proposed site, the application will be referred to my Department&rsquo;s Archaeologists so that the site can be assessed in conjunction with the National Monuments Service.  </p><p>Upon receiving the application, the District Inspector may decide that further information such as revised maps, submission of a Natura Impact Assessment, hydrological report or a soil report is required.  The applicant and their registered forester will be advised by letter of what information is being sought.</p><p>The District Inspector will desk assess the application and may carry out a field assessment where risk analysis selects the application or where the inspector&rsquo;s own knowledge will deem a field inspection necessary.  All forestry licence applications undergo Appropriate Assessment (AA) screening.  </p><p>I  acknowledge that changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP) has resulted in delays to many files.  These are beyond my Department&rsquo;s control as we are obliged to implement changes to AAP that were required following important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee and others. </p><p>Currently, we are amending the AA procedure in order to introduce a robust and workable system which will address the issues now faced.  Introducing this system involves the recruitment of additional ecological expertise and changes in procedures for the forestry inspectorate.  My Department recently advertised for additional ecologists and we also have access to external ecological support, which will be supplemented in due course.  Inspectors have already undergone training and will receive appropriate support in delivering these new procedures.  A categorisation of files affected by these requirements is also underway in order to best assess further action needed and by whom.</p><p>Notwithstanding that this has led to a temporary disruption in issuing afforestation licences, the Deputy should be aware that the sector has approximately 3,200 hectares of approvals issued this year which are shovel-ready and yet to be planted.  </p><p>If the site is greater than 50ha, or 2km for a forest road, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be required.  This will enable an Environmental Impact Assessment to be carried out.  Where an application is less than these areas/lengths, that is sub-threshold, an EIS may also be required.  This will be in situations where the proposed development is likely to have a significant environmental impact.</p><p>When the inspector is satisfied with the assessment of the application, recommendations will be provided.  These recommendations will form part of the decision on the application, which will be issued to the applicant and their registered forester.  The decision will also issue to any individual who made a submission on the application.  The decision provides for 28 days in which to make an appeal, to the independent Forestry Appeals Committee.  During that time, no forestry operations may take place.</p><p><i>Other Considerations</i></p><p>Apart from possible environmental impacts, the application will be assessed against other criteria, such as silvicultural requirements, the social impacts of the application and the local landscape.  The application, where appropriate, must meet certain silvicultural standards.  Tree felling licences may require a harvest plan and the application must consider the careful management of harvesting operations to minimise the potential effect on the surrounding area.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.535.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100059#WRJ04600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 190 to 196, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) has been debated extensively in the D&aacute;il, as recently as 23 October 2019. As a State intervention, the NBP must comply with the requirements scheduling of the European Commission&rsquo;s Guidelines on the application of State aid rules for broadband networks. The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention D&aacute;il business is required. </p>  <p>  Since July 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive process of mapping broadband availability in Ireland in order to identify premises requiring State intervention. The mapping exercise has been supported by a number of public consultations which have elicited significant response from industry and the public. The most significant changes to the NBP Map took place in 2017. The Department added a further 84,500 premises to the Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department had failed to materialise. The update also removed 300,000 premises from the intervention area on the basis of what was then a planned infrastructure build, that eir entered into a Commitment Agreement in respect of. </p>  <p>  Having consulted with industry on an ongoing basis, my Department recently conducted a final public consultation to close the mapping exercise in advance of the award of the NBP contract. Over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public. </p>  <p>  Following evaluation of the submissions and receipt of a positive State aid decision on 15 November, responses have been issued to the submissions from the commercial operators. Having evaluated the submissions received, approximately 38,000 premises were removed from the intervention area as commercial operators provided evidence that these premises can now access a high speed broadband service from an existing network. These premises relate to network deployment detailed in submissions received from eir and SIRO, that were evaluated as meeting the assessment criteria published by the Department. </p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 37,000 premises originally identified as being served by commercial operators have now been included in the intervention area matter for the NBP, as commercial operators plans to serve these premises have not materialised. The map has also been updated for approximately an additional 2,000 premises identified in the latest Ordinance Survey Ireland data. The final Intervention Area now covers 537,596 premises.</p>  <p>  The NBP contract, which was signed on 18 November, provides that the future proofed high speed broadband network to be deployed by National Broadband Ireland will also pass and connect new premises built in the intervention area over the next 25 years. While a download speed threshold of 30Mbps applied in the mapping process as a requirement, the tender submitted by National Broadband Ireland committed to a network that will initially provide services of 150Mbps to the majority of homes and up to 1Gbps to heavy data users and Small and Medium size Enterprises. There will be an upgrade pathway for the 150Mbps broadband product for consumers to 300Mbps by year 6 of the rollout and to 500Mbps by year 10. The 1Gbps product for businesses will also upgrade to 2Gbps by year 11. </p>  <p>  These commitments are reflected in the NBP contract and will ensure that people living and working in rural areas, will have access to a similar quality of broadband service to people living and working in urban areas. The maximum possible investment by the State under the National Broadband Plan is capped at &euro;2.977 billion over 25 years. This includes &euro;480m for contingency costs and &euro;354m in VAT.</p></reply>

The Government has also agreed that an amendment to give effect to this decision be introduced at the Committee stage of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill, 2019. That legislation completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in October 2019.    The contract for TV licence collection will be for a period of 5 years in order to make it feasible for the successful tenderer to invest in the database and collection improvements. At the end of the contract period, the licence fee will be replaced by a device-independent charge to support public service content.</p></reply>

These actions include developing the charging network to stay sufficiently ahead of demand.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 96 fast chargers (the majority of which are operated by the ESB) in Ireland. A real-time map showing the ESB charge point locations, including the status and availability of these charge points, is available on the ESB's website at www.esb.ie/ecars.</p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million which will support the ESB to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with the ESB also investing &euro;10 million. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. </p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by the ESB and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided &euro;36 million in funding to my Department to support the uptake of electric vehicles and supporting charging infrastructure. In August, I announced funding to support the rollout of on-street public charge points for electric vehicles. A total of &euro;2 million has been provided in Budget 2020 to support the installation of up to 400 on-street chargers in 2020. All Local Authorities can now apply for funding to the SEAI for this support to develop on-street charging infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Businesses can already avail of accelerated capital allowances for the purchase and installation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This enables businesses to invest in energy efficient equipment, including electric charging infrastructure, and deduct the full cost of such equipment in the year of purchase rather than over 8 years. </p></reply>

This project will include Variable Speed Limits, referred to as VSLs and Lane Control Signalling.</p><p><b>[Variable Speed Limits (VSLs)]</b></p><p>The VSL regime on the M50 is intended to improve the operational efficiency of the motorway by</p><p>- smoothing traffic flow,</p><p>- improving journey time reliability, and</p><p>- reducing the number of traffic collisions.</p><p>As I mentioned, lane control signalling will also be installed as part of the project which will allow the rapid closing off of lanes.</p><p><b>Status of the project.</b></p><p>With regard to the status of the EMOS project, my Department is progressing the legislative arrangements to provide TII with the powers to operate VSLs.  The legislative proposals will be contained in the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  A General Scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government for formal drafting, subject to two items  being examined further.  </p><p>These two items - for graduated speeding penalties and the carrying of driving licences - have now been examined in detail at Cabinet Committee and I shall be referring them back to Government shortly.  In the meantime, work on drafting the other provisions of the Bill is under way in the Office for the Attorney General.  I hope to publish the Bill before the end of the year.  </p><p>I am also advised that, in order to progress this important measure, TII is extending the motorway traffic control centre at Dublin Tunnel to cater for the additional workload from introduction of VSLs.  Phase 1, which includes the new Control Room, is expected to be handed over before the end of this month (November 2019). Tender competitions to procure the management systems and hardware for the operation and roll-out of VSLs for the M50 are progressing. Tenders for the software were returned at the end of last month (October 2019) and the tenders for the hardware are due back this week.</p><p>All the preparatory technical and logistical frameworks will need to be put in place by TII before VSLs can be introduced and become operational.  As I have just explained, this work is ongoing and I  expect that the first phase will be completed in mid-2020.</p><p><b>Public Transport Role</b></p><p>In addition, Project Ireland 2040 identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme. These will be delivered by the National Transport Authority (NTA) progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network that will match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade, all of which will have a positive effect on the M50.</p><p><b>Funding allocated and amount drawn down to date.</b></p><p>In 2019, TII provided an allocation of &euro;16.75m to progress this project.</p><p>Approximately &euro;12m has been drawn down to-date in 2019.</p><p>I very much support this project and look forward to its introduction. </p></reply>

A programme of work is underway to streamline this process involving my Department, the RSA and the Courts Service.</p>  <p>  Primarily this programme will automate the current manual process for sending notification of driver disqualifications by the Court Services. Automation of this process will reduce the time taken to update my Departments National Vehicle Driver File (NVDF) with details of driver disqualifications. This reduction in time will reduce the risk of disqualified drivers obtaining licences because the National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) were unaware of a disqualification. It will also help reduce any errors due to manual updating of disqualification notifications and driver records.</p>  <p>  The programme of work involved is to be undertaken in two Phases. Phase I will automate records of disqualified drivers where a driver number has been captured while Phase II will cover all remaining records. Phase I is expected to be complete by the end of this year while Phase II will commence in 2020. </p>  <p>  The average time for uploading a Court Notice taking account of the of its transmission from the Courts Service and uploading on the NVDF is 6 weeks, this includes the period of 14 days which is allowed for a driver to appeal the disqualification.</p></reply>

Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. As regards regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  My Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) with over &euro;2m in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design. </p>  <p>  My Department has discussed the project with Cavan County Council and this year I gave an allocation of &euro;100,000 to the Council to enable it  to undertake a detailed appraisal, in line with the current requirements in the Public Spending Code and the Capital Appraisal Framework, of the Cavan to Dundalk section of the route.  The aim of the detailed appraisal would be to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it can be justified in terms of appraisal and advanced for further consideration in relation to schemes for future development.   Preparation of the appraisal is the responsibility of the Council.</p>  <p>  As regards investment in rural roads more generally, Exchequer funding of &euro;483 million has been made available this year to assist local authorities.  Grant allocations for 2020 will be announced in January/February next year.</p>  <p>   In relation to the national road element of the east- west route, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, construction and operation of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. I have, therefore, referred your Question to TII for direct reply. If you do not receive a reply within 10 working days please advise my Office.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.599.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100061#WRL00400"><p>Improving public transport services and infrastructure, including national bus, taxi and other public service vehicles (PSV) networks, is central to providing an alternative to private car travel.  In <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>, the government has indicatively allocated &euro;8.6 billion over the period 2018 to 2027 towards the delivery of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. Furthermore, I have made clear my intent, and that of the Government, to drive the transition from fossil-fuelled vehicles towards greener fuels and technologies. </p><p>While the public transport network, including buses, taxis and trains accounts for only a little over 4% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall transport emissions, moving to low-emission alternatives for public transport is important in order to promote and normalise the use of lower emitting fuels and technologies. Such technologies offer significant benefits in reducing carbon and other harmful air pollutant emissions, and also play a strong leadership role in addressing the effects of climate change.</p><p>A Green Public Transport Fund operates at a national level to support the piloting and uptake of energy-efficient and alternatively-fuelled technologies for Public Service Obligation (PSO) operations within the bus fleet and the Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSV) sector. It also helps vehicle purchasers to bridge the price differential between such technologies and conventionally-fuelled vehicles.  </p><p>Under the Fund, I established the national Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme in 2018, as part of a range of other incentives to support electric vehicles. The SPSVs supported under the scheme include taxis, hackneys and limousines. The scheme currently provides grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. </p><p>This initiative has resulted in the registration of 70 electric SPSVs to date. I understand that, to date, one such grant was issued to an SPSV driver resident in Co. Sligo. The scheme will be continued and expanded in 2020 and is open to applicants across the country. Recognising the important role that the SPSV sector can play in demonstrating electric vehicle (EV) technology to a wider audience I have also agreed, under the <i>Climate Action Plan,</i>to improve the value of the eSPSV grant to those transitioning to wheelchair accessible electric SPSVs. This will help to make electric vehicles available to a greater number of our citizens. Furthermore, I have secured &euro;1.5m of funding in 2020 to install dedicated fast charging infrastructure for the SPSV sector.  </p><p>In the Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) sector, e.g. buses and trucks, electric technology is not quite as advanced as it is for smaller vehicles.  To assist the transition of the bus and truck fleets to low emission vehicles, I intend to introduce a new Alternative Fuels Heavy Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant scheme in 2020. Under this scheme, which will operate at a national level, it is envisaged that grants of up to 30% of the cost differential between a traditional fossil-fuelled HDV and an equivalent alternatively-fuelled vehicle will be available. Complementary supports such as introduction of a new reduced tolling incentive regime for alternatively-fuelled Heavy Duty Vehicles will also be introduced.</p></reply>

For this reason, I am interpreting the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;sporting tourism&rdquo; in this question as referring to tourism based on sport and recreation leisure activities, or &ldquo;activity tourism&rdquo; (rather than to tourism relating to major sporting events).</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Tourism Action Plan 2019-2021 commits to developing and enhancing tourism experiences within the framework of Project Ireland 2040.  In this regard, the Deputy will be pleased to note that investment in activity-based tourism is one of the priority areas for tourism capital investment under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 in order to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking. In terms of cooperation with relevant organisations, I can assure the Deputy that my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland take a consultative and collaborative approach to activity tourism-related projects and initiatives with which we are involved.</p>  <p>  With regard to Greenways, submissions received during the public consultation phase of the development of my Department&rsquo;s Strategy for the Future Development of National and Regional Greenways included ones from Sport Ireland and from several cycling groups, including Cyclist.ie (the representative body for everyday cyclists).  These views were taken into account as part of the finalisation of the Strategy.  Sport Ireland also formed part of the assessment panel that looked at applications for funding under the recent funding call where &euro;40m was allocated to 10 Greenway projects around the country.</p>  <p>  In terms of other aspects of our overall activity tourism offering, F&aacute;ilte Ireland works closely with other relevant parties, including Sport Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  One key collaboration is F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s partnership with the Department of Rural and Community Development on its Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, to support the development of new and enhanced outdoor recreation infrastructure and amenities throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  In order to help ensure alignment of efforts across all relevant Government Departments and State agencies, the Deputy will be pleased to note that officials from my Department and from F&aacute;ilte Ireland participate in the National Outdoor Recreation Group, which comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht - a cross-organisational group of public service recreational infrastructure providers, which aims to coordinate the approach to outdoor recreation across State-owned lands and waterways.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also a member of Comhairle na Tuaithe (under the responsibility of the Minister for Rural and Community Development) which was, earlier this year, given a strengthened mandate with regard to the sustainable development of the outdoor recreation sector in Ireland. </p></reply>

In addition, the media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I am very supportive of the work of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs and benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides financial assistance, subject to eligibility criteria, to applicants who are proposing to bid to host international events (including sporting events) in Ireland that would attract significant numbers of international visitors.  When an event with international tourism appeal is confirmed for Ireland, Tourism Ireland would then promote it in relevant markets overseas.  </p>  <p>  In terms of forthcoming sporting events, Ireland will host four games as part of the UEFA EURO 2020 football tournament in June 2020 - three group games and one round of 16 game.  The bid to host was a collaborative effort between the Football Association of Ireland, Dublin City Council and my Department.  In the sport of golf, the return of the Ryder Cup to Ireland in 2026 was announced in July of this year.  This major event will take place in Adare, Co Limerick, and officials in the Department and the State agencies will be working closely with the event organisers in relation to the planning and organisation of the event. </p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I also support efforts to explore possibilities to host other major sporting events.  With regard to soccer, we welcomed the announcement by the FAI and IFA of their intention to submit a joint bid to host the UEFA European Under 21 Championships in 2023.  In addition, the national football associations of the United Kingdom and Ireland are in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup.  This consideration is at an early stage.  </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have both supported the bid to host the European Cross-Country Championship, which was successful and now will be hosted in Dublin in December 2020.  </p></reply>

Overseas visitor data released by the CSO for the first half of 2019 show that spending in Ireland by overseas visitors was &euro;2,276 million, up 0.3% on the same period in 2018. F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that the overall tourism employment figure is now greater than 260,000. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, I secured an allocation of &euro;186 million for tourism, up 10% (over &euro;17m) on the 2019 allocation, which puts the sector in a strong position to grow next year. The additional resources in 2020 are primarily directed at tourism product development, including Greenways, and build on the &euro;35 million increase in 2019. Furthermore, &euro;7 million is being provided in a 2019 supplementary budget, to support accelerated tourism marketing initiatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of Brexit. Budget 2020 also provided for an additional &euro;40 million contingency fund in the event of a No-Deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently unveiled its plans for 2020 which focus on helping to sustain and support the tourism industry region by region.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland will launch its 2020 marketing plans in early December. These plans will be consistent with the tourism commitments under the Government's Global Ireland Strategy. Under this Strategy, we are committed to developing tourism from new and emerging tourism markets with potential for Ireland. In Budget 2019, I provided almost &euro;4 million in additional funding to Tourism Ireland to enable it to commence the implementation of strategies for growth in these new and emerging markets.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in July of this year, the Government adopted new Tourism targets out to 2025. The headline target is revenue from overseas tourists of &euro;6.5 billion (in real terms) by 2025.  Secondary targets have also been set and they are: employment in the sector increasing to 310,000; and 11.6 million overseas tourist visits by 2025.</p></reply>

Second, as  life expectancy increases, to help maintain the sustainability of our pensions system.  In order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, legislation passed in 2011 provides for an increase in the State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  Many other EU/OECD countries are making similar provisions. The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy. </p>  <p>  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.   </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person ceases their employment before reaching State pension age, they may if they do not find alternative employment apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.   </p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement age of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It allows up to 20 years (since 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or for an incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions and credits, and for homemaker credits to be awarded for homemaking periods of less than a full contribution year.  </p>  <p>  In January 2018, HomeCaring Periods were introduced as part of the interim total contributions approach (TCA) to the calculation of pension entitlement for those state pension (contributory) customers born on or after 1 September 1946 and in receipt of pension on post-2012 Budget rates.  The TCA provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods in that pension entitlement calculation for applicants who took time out of the workplace for parenting or caring duties.  I am advised that it is unknown how many on pre 2012 reduced rates would qualify for a higher rate under the TCA. These claims were not reviewed as they were not affected by the 2012 Budget changes. </p>  <p>  According to the most recent records of my Department, 39,557 women are in receipt of state pension (contributory) under the pre-Budget 2012 rate bands at less than the maximum rate of pension. Of these, 707 women could not have benefited from the Homemakers Scheme as they were pension age before the introduction of the scheme in 1994.  The provisions of the Homemakers Scheme would have been applied in processing the remaining claims if the persons concerned had advised of their caring duties in their application.  It should be noted, however, that while a person&rsquo;s yearly average may increase under the provisions of the Homemakers Scheme, it may still remain within the same rate band and thus may not result in an increase in pension.  </p>  <p>  The 23,833 women on the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) are those who have been assessed with a yearly average of 48 contributions or over.  The 10,808 who were in receipt of Invalidity Pension at maximum rate prior to their 66th birthday and who automatically transferred to the maximum rate of State pension (contributory) on reaching pension age are not included in the figure of 23,833.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commission made its recommendation on the basis of an orderly Brexit. In developing its recommendation on the National Minimum Wage, the Low Pay Commission assessed various economic indicators such as changes in earnings, exchange rates, employment, unemployment, productivity, international minimum wage comparisons, the need for job creation and the likely impact of the National Minimum Wage changes on levels of employment, cost of living, and national competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  Although there is still optimism of a Brexit deal being ratified, the possibility of a disorderly Brexit is still present and therefore the economic circumstances which will apply in 2020 continue to be very uncertain.  Nevertheless, the Government has accepted in full the recommendation of the Commission, but has decided to defer a decision on when the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation will commence until the outcome of Brexit becomes clearer.</p>  <p>  I intend to make provision in the Social Welfare Budget Bill to allow me to set the National Minimum Wage for 2020 in line with the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, once the situation in respect of Brexit is clarified.</p></reply>

The rate of the levy has increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards and in respect of which site owners will become liable to with effect from January 2020.</p>  <p>  The primary objective of the levy is to act as a mechanism to incentivise the development of vacant and underutilised sites in urban areas for both the provision of housing and the development and renewal of land, thereby facilitating the most efficient use of such land and sites and enabling them to be brought into beneficial use rather than allowing them to remain dormant and undeveloped.  It is not intended that the levy be a revenue generating measure. The proceeds of the levy do not accrue to the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  The proceeds of the levy raised on vacant sites by individual planning authorities will be used by them for the provision of housing and regeneration development in the local area in which vacant sites are located.  For example, the levy proceeds may be spent on:</p>  <p>  - the provision of housing, the preservation/protection of structures of special architectural, historical, cultural interest etc.,</p>  <p>  - the provision or improvement of services or facilities for the local community i.e. education, training, recreational, cultural facilities,</p>  <p>  - the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities, including recreational amenities, on the land, civic improvements, and </p>  <p>  - projects/works for the benefit of urban streets in the area including the improvement of streets/ footpaths in local shopping streets and business areas and the removal of graffiti.  </p>  <p>  No more than 10% of the levy monies received by planning authorities may be used on their administration costs.  </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The 2015 Regulations governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities. Under the terms of the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme 2016, Part V homes regardless of when they were tenanted are excluded to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been completed and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations.  </p>  <p>  I intend to bring a comprehensive package of social housing reform measures to Government in the near future and the review of the Tenant Purchase Scheme will be published as part of that process.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-21a.746.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112100063#WRN03100"><p>I assume the Question is referring to a development in Boherboy Road, Mayfield, Cork City, that I launched with An Taoiseach on 16 November 2019.  From the outset, I would like to clarify that this development comprises homes that will be made available for purchase under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements rather than being made available for rental.</p><p>In line with the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland to support the delivery of more affordable homes to buy or rent, this Government has allocated &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), from 2019 to 2021, to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes on local authority lands.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites. </p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will see the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.  One of the 35 approved projects, is the aforementioned Boherboy Road development in Cork City Council.</p><p>This site at Boherboy is local authority owned lands and has received approval for SSF funding of almost &euro;5m for infrastructure that will support the delivery of 116 affordable homes.  In addition, 37 further homes will be made available on the site for social housing.  The homes made available for affordable purchase will be a mix of detached, semi-detached and terraced with a variety of house types and designs.  Cork City Council have indicated to my Department that this project will be delivered in five different phases, with the first phase to be available in Q3 of 2020. </p><p>Cork City Council has provided a breakdown of the house type, the number of affordable homes, the anticipated starting price of the affordable homes and the floor area. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>House Type </div></th>       <th><div>Number of Units </div></th>       <th><div>Pricing (From) </div></th>       <th><div>Approx. Floor Areas (m&sup2;)</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 Bedroom House </td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>&euro;198,000 </td>       <td>70m&sup2; </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 Bedroom House </td>       <td>92 </td>       <td>&euro; 223,000 </td>       <td>92m&sup2; </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It should be noted that the above-mentioned prices take into account the maximum discount of &euro;20,000 that is available to purchasers through the Help to Buy Scheme.  Therefore the prices quoted above are the minimum sales prices to eligible purchasers and based on their individual applicable discounts.</p><p>Homes delivered under the SSF are subject to the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which was commenced in June 2018.  This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  I can confirm that Cork City Council submitted their Scheme of Priority to my Department on 3<sup></sup>May 2019, which I subsequently approved on 28 June 2019.</p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of the programme is &euro;75.6m comprising &euro;42m exchequer funding and &euro;33.6m through private sector development.  My Department has committed &euro;20m funding for a physical and social programme of works and it is open to the Council to pursue funding from other Government Departments to achieve the &euro;42m exchequer spend.  </p>  <p>  A key element of the regeneration programme is the upgrading of the housing stock in the Cranmore Estate at an estimated cost of &euro;8.6m. The first tranche involving works to 96 homes received funding approval in October 2019, at a cost of &euro;4.4m. Sligo County Council aim to be on site in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Alongside this, the upgrade works to the junction of Devins Drive/Cranmore Road, the provision of Pedestrian/Bicycle Link to Chapel Hill and the refurbishment of void properties are among the elements of the Physical Regeneration programme, as is the construction of a new Community Centre.

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural heritage is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. </p>  <p>  Malahide Estuary SAC is situated immediately north of Malahide and east of Swords and has been selected for designation for a number of habitats. The site is also important ornithologically, holding an internationally important population of Brent Goose and attracting migrant species such as Ruff, Curlew Sandpiper, Spotted Redshank and Little Stint. </p>  <p>  My Department do not own or manage any part of this SAC. Monitoring of SACs are carried out by my Department on a cyclical basis, typically every three years. There are no plans to undertake further scientific surveys in the Malahide Estuary SAC at this time.</p></reply>

The internationally recognised practice of heritage-led regeneration shows that heritage can be used to create a desirable place where people can live, visit and do business. Heritage-led regeneration brings economic benefits enabling our historic towns to prosper through increased visitor numbers and decreased numbers of vacant buildings and commercial premises. This initiative is presently targeted at towns with an indicative minimum population level of 1,500 people.</p><p>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme, however, operated by my colleague, Michael Ring, TD, Minister for Rural and Community Development has a category of funding which includes towns and villages with a population under 1,500 people. It is a key part of this Government's Action Plan for Rural Development and is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout Ireland.  Further details are available on that Department&rsquo;s website - .  </p><p>In my own Department, I recently launched a &euro;4.3m fund for conservation and repair of Ireland&rsquo;s protected historic structures through 2 grant schemes, the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund, both of which are administered through the local authorities. These schemes are provided by my Department to assist the owners of protected buildings and structures with meeting their obligations to care for and safeguard our built heritage. Applications can be made to Local Authorities until 31 January 2020 and both schemes are open to applications for projects across the Country, including in towns with a population of under 1,500.  Further details are available on my Departments website and on all local authority websites. </p></reply>
