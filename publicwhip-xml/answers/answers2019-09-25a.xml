It is not possible to accurately categorise pension recipients into either single persons living alone or couples.</p>  <p>  Both state pension (contributory) and (non-contributory) recipients may claim an increase for qualified adult where their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is being wholly or mainly maintained by them and where that qualified adult&rsquo;s means are below a weekly means test limit.  Over 60,000 state pension contributory recipients and over 3,000 state pension non-contributory recipients are getting an increase for qualified adult payment.  </p>  <p>  In the case of state pension non-contributory, qualified adult increases are only paid in respect of dependants under pension age, as once they reach pension age they are entitled to claim pension in their own right. </p>  <p>  For both pension types, a couple can comprise of  two people in receipt of their individual personal pensions.  It is not possible to provide statistics on the status of these relationships, or where any change of status occurs such as separation, divorce or widowhood.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This is the first step in reaching an in-depth understanding of this complex issue.  I hope that  this research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities from a whole-of-Government perspective.</p><p>Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by the Department to carry out this research into the cost of disability.  This work is currently under way.</p><p>The research will look at three main items.  Firstly, the conceptual underpinnings of a &ldquo;cost of disability&rdquo; will be examined.  Secondly, it will analyse what would be a reasonable estimate of a &ldquo;cost of disability&rdquo; in varying circumstances for people living in Ireland.  Thirdly, the implications for public policy and service delivery will be teased out.</p><p>It is envisaged that the research will provide quantitative estimates of the cost of disability using a number of approaches.  This will include data based on the direct experience of people with disabilities.  </p><p>This is an important piece of work which I understand is progressing well and I look forward to the completed report in due course.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-25a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500062#WRA01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 19 together.</p>  <p>  The Public Services Card (PSC) was provided for in legislation in 1998 when it was introduced alongside the PPSN to replace the previous Revenue and Social Insurance number (RSI) and the Social Service Card (SSC).</p>  <p>  The clear and stated objective as articulated in Oireachtas at that time was that the Public Services Card was not to be confined to welfare services but to act as an identifier for access to a broad range of public services.  Successive Governments have reaffirmed this policy both in Government decisions and through legislation.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office advises that the legislation is clear and provides a strong basis for the existing and continued use of the PSC across the public service.</p>  <p>  The PSC provides citizens with the convenience of only have to submit information to verify their identity once.  As an example about 70,000 people use the PSC to apply for passports each year; we pay over 600,000 people approximately &euro;150m through our post offices each week using the PSC as the identifier in each case; 600,000 free travel journeys are made using the PSC each week, about 400,000 PSC users use the MyGovID service to access online services with Revenue, SUSI, the National Driving Licence Service, Welfare and, shortly, the NCS.</p>  <p>  The PSC has strong public support &ndash; approaching 90% of the adult population hold a PSC and research indicates they overwhelmingly value the card, are fully aware of and agree to the sharing of data required to enable its use across the public service, believe that they have more than enough information about the purposes of the card and understand why, and do not object to, their data being retained.</p>  <p>  In October 2017 the DPC commenced an investigation into the SAFE / PSC process and delivered its final report to the Department on 15 August 2019.  On 17th September, the Department published the report of the DPC together with a summary of its own response to the findings of the report, and related correspondence between it and the DPC. </p>  <p>  As stated earlier this month, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Paschal Donohoe T.D. and I informed Government that we are satisfied that the processing of personal data related to the PSC does in fact have a strong legal basis, the retention of data is lawful and that the information provided to users does satisfy the requirements of transparency.  This opinion was arrived at following very careful consideration both of the report and of the strong legal advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. </p>  <p>  The DPC had requested that the Department implement a number of actions on foot of the publication of their statement on Friday 16th August, within a very short time frame.  However, based on the strong legal advice received, we believe that it would be inappropriate, and potentially unlawful, to withdraw or modify the use of the PSC or the data processes that underpin it, as has been requested by the DPC.</p>  <p>  The Department sought to meet with the DPC on two occasions since receipt of the report with a view to outlining the basis for its conclusions and seeking to clarify a number of matters of concern relating to inconsistencies between both within the DPC's Report and between the report and the accompanying letter from the DPC.  The request for a meeting was declined on both occasions.</p>  <p>  The Department wrote to the DPC to advise it of the decisions now taken and understands that the DPC is now in the process of preparing an enforcement notice.  To date, the DPC has not issued an Enforcement Notice.  On receipt, the Department will consider the scope and terms of the enforcement notice and respond appropriately at that time.  It should be noted that the findings in the DPC report do not have the force of law until such time as they are formalised in an enforcement notice.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime the Department will continue to conduct SAFE registration and issue the PSCs.  It will also retain the supporting documentation collected as part of the SAFE process.  The reason for this is that it is not sufficient, in the case of a dispute over any decision, to simply record that decision was taken it is also necessary to produce the documentation on which the decision was grounded.  Other bodies, for example credit unions, public utilities and banks, similarly retain documentation submitted in support of applications for their services for as long as the person concerned is a customer of their organisation. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that data relating to individuals is securely held and used only for relevant business purposes.  The Department&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding data is reflected in its use of advanced data processing and storage technology hosted in secure, State owned and operated, data centres and is reinforced by a range of legislative and administrative provisions that are designed to protect the rights and interests of individuals. </p>  <p>  Neither the PSC, nor the underlying Public Service Identity dataset, contains any information relating to the holder&rsquo;s use of public services. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) restricts the sharing and use of the Public Service Identity (PSI) data to a number of specified bodies set out in Schedule 5 of that Act and only in relation to a transaction a person has with that specified body.  It is important to note, contrary to statements by some commentators, that the sharing of the PSI dataset does not involve sharing information regarding use of public services.</p></reply>

It acts as an income support for those who cannot work due to their caring responsibilities.  The means test is one of the most generous in the social welfare system, especially in respect of spouse&rsquo;s income.  The income disregard is &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate.  A half-rate Carer's Allowance may be payable with other welfare payments. </p>  <p>  The means test has a critical role in determining whether or not there is an income need for a payment and that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  Any changes to qualifying criteria for schemes, including income disregards, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Decisions on claims are made by Deciding Officers of the Department in line with provisions set out in legislation.  This ensures that rules are applied consistently and transparently to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The processing times for all claims is constantly monitored, with steps taken to improve processing times within existing resource allocations when though necessary.  These measures may include the assignment of additional staff, where available, and reviewing business processes to ensure the efficient processing of applications.  The average processing time for the award of a Carer&rsquo;s Allowance between January and August 2019 was 14 weeks.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-25a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500062#WRA02100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 26 together.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Social welfare schemes such Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA), with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process.  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to CA, evidence must be provided in respect of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer's means.  It is also the case that in order to register their claim and establish an early entitlement claim date many people submit a claim without first securing all of the necessary supporting documentation.  While this does ensure that people will be paid with arrears from an early "effective" date it does mean that the time taken to subsequently submit, receive and then assess this additional information is also reflected in the processing times.  </p>  <p>  The average processing time for the award of a Carer's Allowance claim from January 2019 to August 2019 was 14 weeks.  I wish to reassure the Deputy that claim processing is kept under active review, with all possible steps taken to improve processing times.  This includes the assignment of additional resources, where available, and the review of business processes, to ensure the efficient processing of applications.  As an example, additional staff have been temporarily assigned to the Carer's Allowance area to work on claims processing and changes have been made to the operational processes to maximise processing capability and assist in improving processing times.  As the Deputy points out, in the event of need, supplementary welfare allowance is always available to avoid hardship. </p>  <p>  I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  Various disregards apply across the schemes, reducing the amount of means assessed.</p>  <p>  In this regard, for most social assistance schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is fully disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  The first &euro;50,000 of capital is disregarded in the disability allowance means test.</p>  <p>  The assessment of capital reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital or to realise the value of property to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment.  The family home is not assessed.</p>  <p>  Any proposals to change the capital means assessment for means-tested social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

We have also increase the payments to qualified children for the first time since 2010 and provided for higher payments to children aged 12 years and over.</p>  <p>  In addition, we restored the Christmas Bonus to 100%.  This is paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients to assist people with the extra expenses incurred over the Christmas period. </p>  <p>  Recent budgetary changes have resulted in real increases to the rates of payment.  Increasing the standard rates of payment is, however, only one approach the Government has taken to improve the living standards of social welfare recipients.  We have also introduced measures which target those most at risk of poverty such as increasing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, extending the fuel allowance season, increasing funding for school meals, increasing income disregards for lone parents and low income families and strengthening the provision of employment supports.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget preparations, as well as assessing developments in the economic environment, my Department examines the impact of potential Budget measures on income and poverty rates and a social impact assessment is carried out.  This is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely distributive effects of changes on household income using the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model. </p>  <p>  Discussions are ongoing in relation to the Budget on October 8th. </p></reply>

This scheme will provide a social insurance contribution based benefit to the self-employed who lose their self-employment and consequently are not engaged in self-employment. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Bill 2019 introducing the new scheme on a statutory basis was published on the 28th of June and has completed second stage in the Seanad. Once it has completed all stages in the Seanad it will be introduced to the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  I have also announced the introduction of a parent's benefit scheme to be introduced later this year.  This support will also be available to the self-employed and will provide both parents with 2 weeks paid leave from employment to care for their children during their first year.   </p>  <p>  The addition of these new schemes builds on other significant improvements for self-employed people in recent years such as access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits in 2017.  Access to invalidity pension provides the self-employed access to a safety-net of income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of a long-term illness or disability without a means test. </p>  <p>  These improvements are part of the Government's stated aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to both employees and self-employed people.  Any further extensions of social insurance benefits to the self-employed would have to considered in a budgetary context having regard to the funding of the Social Insurance Fund. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted by my Department to deliver the service.  </p>  <p>  The JobPath employment service commenced in 2015 and, under the terms of the contracts signed with the providers was to run for at least six years comprising two consecutive phases: phase one entailed four years&rsquo; of client referrals, while phase two entailed a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients were to be referred.  Therefore client referrals were due to cease on 31st December 2019.  The contract included an option to extend the term of referrals for a period no greater than two years.</p>  <p>  This extension is important as it will ensure that the Government retains the necessary labour activation capacity to deal with any labour market uncertainty that arises as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition, it provides my Department with the opportunity review all contracted public employment services and to design and develop a comprehensive model that will incorporate various models of response and be fit for purpose for the Irish labour market from 2021 onwards.  </p>  <p>  As per the econometric review, JobPath has been and continues to be a successful service in providing a comprehensive and value for money activation service for the long-term unemployed.  On this basis, my Department triggered the extension provisions of the existing contracts with the JobPath providers and secured agreement on the extension of these contracts on existing terms and conditions for a further twelve months.  </p>  <p>  This is not a renewal of the JobPath contracts but the execution of the extension clauses of the existing contracts.</p>  <p>  In order to assist my Department in designing and developing an appropriate  contracted public employment service model, external consultants are to be engaged and this procurement process is currently underway. </p></reply>

This report was sponsored by the Pensions Council, which is a statutory body which has been set up to provide advice to me in relation to pensions matters.</p><p>At the outset it is very important to note that the ESRI's research found no consistent evidence of a gender gap in the payment of state pensions.  Measures regarding homecaring periods that I introduced last year and intend to continue in the announced reform of the State pension will ensure that this continues into the future.  </p><p>Men and women have different experiences in the labour market.  My Department has a range of supports for those who wish to re-enter the labour force including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment and the Working Family Payment.</p><p>Furthermore, I launched the Irish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023&quot; in February 2018.  The Roadmap provides for major reform of State, occupational, private and public service pensions.  One of the key proposals is the introduction of an automatic enrolment pensions savings scheme.  It is now widely accepted that reform of the current, purely voluntary approach to retirement saving is required to improve coverage to a desired level.  A report on auto-enrolment will be brought to Government for consideration in the near future to facilitate the next steps for implementation of the scheme in 2022 as planned.</p><p>I share the Deputies' wish that the pension gender gap be eliminated completely and look forward to their continued support for policy initiatives aimed at achieving this result.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

Both schemes are administered through my Department's network of Intreo Centres and Social Welfare Branch Offices throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Payment of Jobseekers Benefit and Assistance is contingent on a person satisfying the qualifying conditions.  A principal requirement for entitlement to Jobseekers Benefit or Assistance is that an individual must be able to demonstrate his or her availability for full-time employment.  In consideration of this condition, any factor which would place an unreasonable restriction on the acceptance of an offer of suitable employment would lead to the claim being disallowed.  </p>  <p>  Deciding Officers have been advised that non-EU nationals who are employed under work permits issued by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and who are in a situation of involuntary unemployment due to the on-going effects of meat factory protests are considered to be available for employment. </p>  <p>  My Department is advising all affected meat factory employees to make a claim for a jobseekers payment regardless of their work / employment permit status.  Each claim will be decided in light of the facts of the situation and the particular circumstances of each individual.  If they have not done so already, affected employees should contact their local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office. Dedicated arrangements have been made to ensure that claims are processed in a timely manner once all supporting documentation is available.  To date approximately 1,700 claims have been received. Of these 1,080 have been decided with only 8 claims having been disallowed.</p>  <p>  Customers on non-EU work permits who satisfy the other conditions for receipt of Jobseekers Benefits, including having a satisfactory contribution record, can be paid Jobseekers Benefit.</p>  <p>  Customers who do not have enough PRSI contributions can apply for Jobseekers Allowance where other conditions apply, including Habitual Residence and satisfying a means test.  Any claim for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance in the case of involuntary short-term lay-offs represents a transient need for support and will be treated as such.</p>  <p>  In the absence of entitlement to Jobseekers Allowance, supports may also be available under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope that clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In that regard I am currently reallocating resources to this issue to understand, measure and quantify better the prevalence of false self-employment and obtain a sectoral analysis of its level of incidence. </p>  <p>  My Department is already focussed on increasing the number of employer inspections it conducts nationwide.  Based on experience from these inspections, and recognising that there is a particular challenge when dealing with large companies or companies with complex legal structures, I also established in August a dedicated team to work strategically in this area.  This team has commenced its work, in parallel with other Inspectors across the country. </p>  <p>  My officials work in cooperation with the inspectorates of the Workplace Relations Commission and Revenue Commissioners as necessary and strong liaisons have been established with those organisations to focus strategically on tackling false self-employment.</p>  <p>  In addition to more rigorous policing of existing law, I intend to introduce a number of new legislative measures to further strengthen our powers.  These measures include putting the 'Guidance on Determining Employment Status' &ndash; which is a revision of the former Code of Practice in this area &ndash; on a statutory footing.  This, in addition to a new offence of misclassifying an employee as self-employed, will both be included in the Social Welfare Budget Bill, which I expect to be enacted by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  I also will bring forward new provisions to address the potential victimisation of workers who seek a determination on their employment status.  These latter provisions will likely mirror similar provisions I brought into law earlier this year via the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.  While the drafting of this legislation is complex, its timely introduction to the Oireachtas remains a priority.</p>  <p>  I am advised that it is not possible to provide figures on money recouped on the sole basis of false self-employment cases alone.  However, as an indication of the level of work going on in relation to PRSI inspections generally, a total of 1,931 employer inspections have been carried out across the country by my Inspectors this year up to the end of last month.  However, savings achieved so far this year from PRSI inspections carried out comes to a total of &euro;1.184m.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

In general, social welfare schemes which involve medical or caring conditionality take the longest time to process.</p>  <p>  These cases have a number of complex qualifying conditions that can take longer to process.  As an example, before a decision can be made on entitlement to Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA), evidence must be provided and examined in respect of the additional care needs of the child.  Similarly, before a decision can be made on entitlement to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (CA), evidence must be provided in respect of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the caree's means.  In considering applications for disability allowance (DA), evidence must be provided in respect of the person&rsquo;s medical condition, the extent to which it restricts them from taking up employment, their means and their habitual residency.  </p>  <p>  It is also the case that in order to register their claim and establish an early entitlement or claim date many people submit a claim without first securing all of the necessary supporting documentation.  While this does ensure that people will be paid with arrears from an early "effective" date it does mean that claims take longer to process. </p>  <p>  My Department is continually working to achieve processing times target which at time we deviate from.  When this happens we continually renew our focus to rectify the matter. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Carlos Holmes Trujillo Garc&iacute;a, to Dublin last month. This visit was a demonstration of the excellent bilateral relations between Ireland and Colombia, which have been going from strength to strength since the recent opening of our respective Embassies in Bogot&aacute; and Dublin. Foreign Minister Trujillo also had an opportunity to meet with members of this House during an appearance before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>  <p>  My meeting with Foreign Minister Trujillo was an opportunity to take stock of this important relationship and to discuss priorities moving forward. There is significant cooperation between our two countries in a number of areas, as demonstrated by the visits last month of a number of Colombian state agencies to Ireland. We discussed this cooperation and the areas on which we will continue to focus, such as trade, investment, agriculture, science, research, innovation and cooperation at the multilateral level. </p>  <p>  I also underlined the ongoing support of Ireland to Colombia in the implementation of its peace agreement, including dealing with setbacks arising from violence. I assured Minister Trujillo that we see our partnership with Colombia in sharing experience of peace-building as a long term commitment. We agreed that we had much to learn from each other as we strive to build and maintain peace in our two countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed more than &euro;14 million in support of the peace process in Colombia since 2007, mainly channelled through the United Nations, and Colombian and international NGOs focusing on human rights, conflict prevention, peace-building and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. </p>  <p>  We will continue to provide support to the Colombian peace process through funding to international organisations, but also through lesson sharing programmes between Ireland and Colombia, based on our own experience of peace building on this island.   </p>  <p>  My Department supported the travel of three experts from Northern Ireland to Colombia in June to engage with the Government on key elements of the peace agreement and its implementation. Officials at my Department in Dublin were also pleased to meet last month with Dr. Emilio Archila, Presidential Counsellor for Stabilisation and Consolidation of Colombia, who is responsible for the implementation of the peace accords.   </p>  <p>  The peace process is fundamental to improving the human rights situation in the country, which I am aware is difficult for many human rights defenders across Colombia, including those in La Guajira region protesting the practices of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine. Officials at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; are due to travel to La Guajira region this week to meet with relevant stakeholders, including human rights defenders, civil society organisations, and representatives of the private sector in the area, including the Cerrej&oacute;n mine. I look forward to receiving the report of this visit. I have also written to the CEO of the ESB requesting further information on their dealings with Cerrej&oacute;n.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace accords in Colombia to ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians. We will continue to work with the Government of Colombia and with our EU partners to ensure a coordinated and effective approach that best supports the peace process.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p>  <p>  The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, T.D. However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. </p>  <p>  Further, I have been advised by Revenue that, from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners at this time.  This is because married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status and it would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.</p>  <p>  Therefore, any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p></reply>

An ambulance must be type approved under the type-approval framework directive, Directive 2007/46/EC, and must meet the technical criteria in Annex XI of that directive to come within the scope of the registration provisions.  This includes criteria that must be met under the provisions of CEN 1789:2007, the European standard specifying requirements for the design and equipping of ambulances used for the transport and care of patients.  A vehicle that is declared as an ambulance will only be registered as a VRT category D vehicle (at a zero rate of VRT) if it has the requisite type approval.  More detailed information is available on the Revenue website at the following link: .</p><p>I am further informed by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exempt from VAT.  The supply of an ambulance is not included in any of those categories. However, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme provides for a refund of VAT and VRT on the purchase of an ambulance for transport of a disabled person or persons within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations. The scheme is open to organisations who fall within the definition of &ldquo;qualifying organisations&rdquo; where their purpose is to provide services to persons with a disability (within the meaning of the Disability Act 2005) and is engaged in the care and transport of a person or persons with a disability. </p><p>Under the Charities VAT Compensation Scheme, charities which are registered with the Charities Regulator can claim for VAT on any expenditure incurred in relation to their charitable activities, except where the charity is already entitled to a refund, deduction, relief or repayment of that VAT. Under this scheme the applicant is entitled to claim a proportion of their VAT costs based on the level of non-public funding they receive.  For example, if 70% of their income comes from non-public funds they may claim back 70% of the eligible VAT incurred.  However, as there is a capped amount of funding available annually under the scheme, charities will be paid on a pro-rata basis where the total amount of claims received exceeds the cap. The scheme has closed for this year and will re-open in January 2020 in respect of expenditure incurred in 2019.</p></reply>

correlative relief claim can arise where an overseas tax authority imposes a transfer pricing adjustment on one party to an intercompany transaction and taxes profits that have already been taxed in Ireland. In order to avoid double taxation, the Irish party to the transaction may have the option to approach Revenue for a repayment of tax on a unilateral basis under the provisions of a double taxation treaty (that is, without involvement of the overseas tax authority). Given the nature of correlative relief claims, Revenue has advised that it is not possible to provide an estimate of claims which may arise in the future. Revenue will only consider the merits of a claim for correlative adjustment when all the necessary information and documentation required to be submitted with a request for a correlative adjustment is provided.  </p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that claim numbers and amount of tax relief granted as a result of corresponding adjustments agreed between Revenue and tax authorities of other countries under the Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAP) provided for in Double Tax Treaties are not included in the above figures. </p></reply>

It allows losses incurred in the course of business or trade to be accounted for when calculating the same business&rsquo; tax liabilities. The purpose of this approach is to recognise that fluctuations in the business cycle may run over several years and that it would be unbalanced to tax profits earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. </p><p>The treatment of losses in Ireland is a long standing feature of our tax system and is a standard feature of the tax systems in all OECD countries. There are therefore no plans to amend the current system, including to time limit the use of losses forward.</p><p>Deputies may be aware that my Department provided a technical note to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in 2018 setting out many of the technical considerations relevant to corporation tax loss relief, and many of these considerations would apply also in respect of income tax loss relief.

I am advised by Revenue that its criterion to be considered a HWI and to therefore come within the remit of the HWI branches of its Large Cases &ndash; High Wealth Individuals Division (LC-HWID) is individuals with net assets of &euro;20 million and over.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that as there is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of their net worth on returns of income it is not possible to estimate the number of individuals with a net worth within the thresholds requested by the Deputy.</p><p>Revenue has had a focus on HWIs over a long period. HWIs have been managed by dedicated units within its Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003. Revenue split its Large Cases Division into two divisions in 2018, one of which, LC-HWID, has a focus on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. As reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), the new Division reviewed the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs it manages.  This review has been published on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie, and provides more detail on the criteria used by Revenue to identify taxpayers with net assets falling within the revised threshold. </p><p>The allocation of resources is a matter for Revenue but I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment, of which the setting up of the LC-HWID was a part, was supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base.  The number of staff currently assigned to the HWI branches is c.60.  I also understand that Revenue established a new Division, the Medium Enterprises Division, to manage the affairs of the tier of cases, both corporate and individuals below that of the Large Cases Divisions. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the HWI case base is adjusted periodically but not necessarily on an annual basis. The following Table provides the number of cases in the HWI case base for the years indicated:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number of HWIs</th></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>571</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>955</td></tr></table></p><p>I am satisfied that the structural realignment by Revenue combined with the risk focused approach to compliance management, will continue to deliver an outcome where HWIs pay the appropriate tax in accordance with the legislation. I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to estimate additional audit yield related to cases recently coming within the responsibility of LC-HWID. There is a presumption of honesty by taxpayers who pay on a self-assessment basis and no category of taxpayer would be regarded, in advance of a case appraisal, as likely to give rise to audit yield. All taxpayers are subject to risk evaluation and intervention as appropriate so bringing a particular category of taxpayers within the remit of the LC-HWID would not, of itself, be a determinant of an increased audit yield.  Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following appraisal of the risk factors in each case.</p><p>Finally, I would like to say to the Deputy that over the last number of Budgets I supported the business case put forward by Revenue in relation to additional resources, both personnel and ICT, and I will continue to examine any proposal put forward by Revenue in the future.</p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment and in consultation with the NCSE.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs. This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where the NCSE identifies need.</p>  <p>  The NCSE works with families and schools to ensure that advance planning is in place so that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p>  <p>  Where there is no suitable placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, Home Tuition Grant funding to provide a compensatory educational service for their child. The availability of a suitable school placement is assessed by the NCSE having regard to, although not limited to, the relevant diagnosis and relevant professional reports.</p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular child, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for personnel matters.  As Minister I have no direct role in these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the allocation and transfer of Garda personnel, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute;, is determined by a number of factors including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, and operational strategies. I am further informed that when the allocation of resources to a Division is being considered, comprehensive consultation is carried out with local Garda management, during which all factors are taken into consideration.</p><p>I would remind Deputies that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete, before they receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations with the required training and development structures and resources in place, for example trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant, who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that while not all Garda Stations are training stations, the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute; to a Divisional training station facilitates the reassignment of Garda&iacute; to other stations within the Division, if required, by the Divisional Officer.</p><p>Finally, the Deputy may also wish to be aware that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We currently have over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,700 Garda staff and we are on track to achieve the Government&rsquo;s plan of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.</p><p>The information as requested by the Deputy in relation to the allocation of Garda recruits since reopening of the Garda College is attached. </p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;Garda Allocations&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p></reply>

The role of the Immigration Service of my Department is to provide immigration mechanisms by which non-EEA medical personnel may be recruited to fill temporary vacancies in the health sector as and when required. I am further advised that in recent months the Immigration Service has consulted closely with the HSE to determine if the terms of the Scheme require any amendments.  My Department remains committed to ongoing stakeholder engagement to ensure the smooth operating of the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) with regards to locum GP&rsquo;s.</p>  <p>  Under current arrangements, which have been in place since 2015, doctors undertaking locum work in the Primary Care (GP) sector may be granted a &lsquo;block&rsquo; 90-day permission for the duration of their 90-day contract. Exit from and re-entry into the State is not permitted during this 90-day period, except in exceptional circumstances.  The terms of the AWS also provide that at least one month must elapse from the expiry date of the 90 day permission before a new application may be made. The rationale for this approach, which applies to all such permissions, is rooted in the principle that an atypical permission is not a substitute for the replacement of full time labour (either sourced within Ireland or the EU or through the Non EEA employment permit regime). Therefore, a person granted such permission cannot automatically roll over their atypical permission.  These conditions have applied to permissions granted under the Scheme since its inception. </p>  <p>  Atypical immigration permissions are specifically designed to cover short term employments in the State and there are alternative options available for longer term employment through the employment permit regime of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  The possibility of establishing a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.  </p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  There have been 33 applications to the scheme and to date, 21 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;540,000.  </p><p>The location of the CCTV schemes which have been approved for funding are as follows: </p><p>- Carrick on Shannon, Co Leitrim</p><p>- Cranmore, Co Sligo</p><p>- Arklow, Co Wicklow</p><p>- Courttown/Riverchapel, Gorey and Wexford Town, Co Wexford </p><p>- Abbeyfeale, Adare, Askeaton, Caherconlish, Cappamore, Castleconnell, Croom, Foynes, Kilmallock, Newcastlewest, Pallasgreen, Patrickswell, Murroe and Rathkeale, County Limerick. </p><p>-  Monaghan Town, Co. Monaghan</p><p>I can confirm that the grant aid scheme remains open for applications from interested groups in 2019 and that all fully completed applications received before the end of 2019 will be considered. </p><p>Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have recently expanded the grant aid scheme to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie </p></reply>

All 38 accommodation centres plus the reception centre at Balseskin, have Friends of the Centre Groups.</p>  <p>  The purpose of a Friends of the Centre Group is to facilitate links between the residents of accommodation centres and local community, voluntary and sporting groups.  It is a contractual obligation for our contractors to provide for Friends of the Centre Groups. The operation of the group is facilitated by staff from the accommodation centre.  For example, the operator of the centre must make a room available to facilitate meetings.  The composition of each group varies from centre to centre but will include staff members, residents and volunteers from the local community.  Officials from the Department will occasionally attend meetings particularly if invited by the group to do so.  All aspects of the accommodation system for international protection applicants is kept under continuous review.</p>  <p>  The scope of and the types of activities engaged in by the group vary from centre to centre.  They reflect the type of residents being accommodated in a centre and also the voluntary groups that are active in a particular locality.  For example, the activities engaged in by a group based in a centre that accommodates only single adults will be different to those engaged in by a group based on a centre accommodating families.  Examples of groups that have engaged with Friends of the Centre include local Tidy Towns committees, sports clubs, men&rsquo;s sheds and Mother and Baby clubs. Activities in the centres are eligible to apply for funding under the Communities Integration Fund (CIF). The Friends of The Centre in Ballaghaderreen have received &euro;5,000 funding on 17 September under the Communities Integration Fund for 2019.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that national security is outside the competence of the EU, so ongoing day-to-day cooperation in this area with the UK will continue following Brexit, whatever form it ultimately takes. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, considerable planning and preparation across the criminal justice area has been ongoing to take account of the potential impact of Brexit, including in relation to ensuring the continuance of effective extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. This is necessary because of Britain&rsquo;s proposed departure from the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system. While the EAW will cease to apply when Brexit occurs, the High Court in the meantime is continuing to deal with outstanding UK EAW cases. </p>  <p>  Following examination of the options available for extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the fall-back solution is to apply the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, to which both Ireland and the UK are party, to extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Convention are given effect to by Part II of the Extradition Act 1965. The 1965 Act has been amended by Part 13 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, which can be commenced when Brexit occurs, in order to ensure that this is a workable solution.  </p>  <p>  As such, I can confirm for the Deputy that should the UK leave the EU without a deal, the UK will as a consequence lose access to the European Arrest Warrant mechanism and will be treated as a third state for extradition purposes. However extradition would be possible between Ireland and the UK under the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, as is the case for other third states. </p>  <p>  EAW cases still active on the date of the departure of the UK from the EU would cease to have effect.  As the Deputy will appreciate, what would happen in any particular case will depend on the individual circumstances of that case. However and in general, if an EAW request ceases to have effect, a new request under the Council of Europe Convention on Extradition would have to be issued before the matter could be considered further.  I can assure the Deputy that this issue has been factored into contingency planning on these matters.</p></reply>

Kildare for accommodation and ancillary services for international protection applicants.  </p>  <p>  Successful bidders were required to undertake mobilisation works to provide for cooking facilities for residents, a foodhall (where residents can procure ingredients and food items as well as toiletries and household items through a points system) and to provide designated living space for families outside of the bedrooms.  A period of 12 weeks was permitted for the completion of any required mobilisation works prior to the inspection of the premises by staff of the International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department (formerly known as the Reception and Integration Agency).

The owner of the premises was advised that the 12 week mobilisation period commenced on 11 April 2019, which required all works to be complete by the 4 July 2019.  The contractor subsequently advised that they were not in a position to commence mobilisation as they had focused resources on the mobilisation works required at other accommodation centres, which had also been placed on the framework. My Department is continuing to engage with the provider to establish a commencement date for the mobilisation works.  </p>  <p>  I should also inform the Deputy that, due to increases in the number of people seeking protection in the State, the Immigration Service in my Department has since commenced a national procurement programme for additional accommodation centres.

No. 14 of 2011. The Directive places the onus on all economic operators (ie manufacturers, distributors, importers) to ensure that only safe toys are placed on the market. If economic operators become aware that toys on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including a recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any such action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant market surveillance authority, ie the CCPC. Where the CCPC finds unsafe toys on the Irish market, it will act to ensure that the responsible economic operators remove the toys from the market until they are in compliance with the legislation. </p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe toys. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I can confirm that the CCPC is aware of the recent survey by the British Toy and Hobby Association. The CCPC has also informed me that the issues raised by the survey are familiar to the CCPC and these issues have also been found during the CCPC&rsquo;s routine market surveillance activities. For the period between January 2016 and July 2019, the CCPC investigated 259,218 toys to check if they were compliant with S.I. No. 14 of 2011 and approximately 28% were found to be non-compliant. Where the relevant economic operator was not able to bring these products into compliance they were then removed from the market.</p>  <p>  The CCPC has also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Customs Service in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, which will provide for greater cooperation between the two bodies and improve the market surveillance of products entering the Irish market. The CCPC is also currently increasing the number of trained staff in its Product Safety Unit and expects the level of both proactive and reactive market surveillance activity to increase in the future.</p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission has recently agreed and published a new Regulation (Regulation 2019/1020 on the Market Surveillance and Compliance of Products) that will give extra powers to market surveillance authorities, such as the CCPC, to regulate products (including toys) sold online. The Regulation will also ensure closer cooperation between market surveillance authorities and customs services in the EU to address the issue of unsafe products (including toys) being imported from third countries. The Regulation will apply from the 16th July 2021 throughout the EU and officials from my Department are currently engaged in preparing implementing legislation to give full effect to all safety and co-operation aspects of the Regulation.</p>  <p>  With regard to ensuring that products sold by online marketplaces meet Irish and EU standards, I can inform the Deputy that all products placed on the EU market must be safe.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-25a.255.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500067#WRF04200"><p>I welcome the adoption of Convention 190 Concerning the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work and the accompanying Recommendation 206 at the 108th Session of the International Labour Conference (ILC) last June.  The Irish tripartite delegation to the ILC played a very active role in the Standard Setting Committee in which the Convention and Recommendation were drawn up.  It should be noted that conventions are legally binding international treaties that may be ratified by ILO member States and recommendations are non-binding guidelines.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work.  Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the world of work and has recently ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention)  </p>  <p>  The issue of ratification by Ireland of Convention 190 is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments. Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.   </p>  <p>  To this end, my officials have already commenced work on a detailed article-by-article examination of the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements enunciated in each article, as well as the extent to which any legislative amendments will be required.  Following consultation with Departments within whose remit elements of the Convention fall, and with the Social Partners, this examination will be sent to the Attorney General for their consideration.  When the Attorney General has indicated that Ireland is in a position to ratify Convention 190 there will be a wider stakeholder consultation to seek views on the ratification of the Convention.   </p>  <p>  In view of the process outlined in the preceding paragraph, you will appreciate that it is not possible at this stage to put a timeframe on ratification of Convention 190.  However, I can assure you of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to work towards being amongst the first ILO member States to ratify Convention 190.  </p></reply>

The impact of certain conduct on the health and well- being of staff within the NMBI was one of the issues raised.  However the Protected Disclosure did not detail a complaint under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, in any event health and welfare issues were subject to the subsequent review under the Protected Disclosure Act 2014.  </p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosure was subject to external review and, on foot of that review two reports were commissioned. One was an organisational review carried out by Crowe Horwath the other by BDO reviewed Remuneration and Contract Management of Non -Permanent Employees. BDO and Crowe Horwath reported in November 2015.  Both reports were accepted in full by the Board on the NMBI and they moved to fully implement the recommendations. This has resulted in a comprehensive change to the governance and management arrangements in NMBI.  </p>  <p>  The matter of the payment of legal fees by the NMBI was addressed in previous PQ replies.  I am advised by my officials that this matter was not raised in the original Protected Disclosure. The NMBI advised that "the protected disclosure took place over a period of almost two years. Persons who are subject to protected disclosures are entitled to due process. NMBI did pay towards the legal costs of a person whose actions were the subject of a protected disclosure."</p>  <p>  I am advised by the NMBI that a payment of &euro;17,318.15 in respect of legal fees was made to the person named in the Protected Disclosure. </p></reply>

The policy objectives in putting in place a scheme to meet the needs of people with disability arising from vaccination are to provide fair and just compensation for those who may have been injured by a vaccine, to reduce the costs to the State by providing an alternative to litigation and to maintaining public confidence in immunisation.  </p><p>My Department asked the Health Research Board to carry out an evidence review on vaccine injury redress programmes in other jurisdictions.  The review has been completed and can now be found on the HRB website.  This matter is under consideration by my Department with a view to developing a proposal regarding a vaccine damage scheme based on evidence concerning vaccine damage schemes, legal advices and consultation with other Government bodies.  </p><p>In June 2018, the Government agreed to the establishment of an Expert Group to review the law of torts and the current systems for the management of clinical negligence claims.  It was agreed that High Court Justice Charles Meenan would Chair the Group which would advise on whether there are alternative mechanisms to the current court process for resolving clinical negligence and personal injury claims.</p><p>Judge Meenan's Expert Group is examining the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively yet more sensitively with certain cases.  In this process the Group is also looking at the impact of tort legislation on the overall patient safety culture and open disclosure.  </p><p>I am informed that submissions were invited by the Group with 39 submissions received in total.  The Expert Group commenced its work in September 2018 and has met on a monthly basis since its first meeting.  Judge Meenan submitted an Interim Report to myself and the Minister for Justice and Equality on the 9th of January.  The Final Report is expected in November. </p></reply>

The first PCI list was adopted in 2013 and the Shannon LNG project has been designated a PCI on each list since that date.</p>  <p>  The fourth list of PCIs is currently under evaluation by the European Commission and it is expected to be adopted in October 2019. The inclusion of the Shannon LNG project on the list continues to have the support of Government.</p>  <p>  As a private commercial project, final investment decisions on whether this project will proceed are matters for the project promoter.</p>  <p>  I intend to carry out a security of supply review which will consider what fossil fuels are required, and how they are sourced, during the transition to a low carbon economy. This is required particularly as coal and peat are removed from electricity generation, and as we move from 30% renewable electricity to 70% renewable electricity. When we go from 30% renewable electricity today to 70% renewable electricity in 2030, we will need backup electricity generation when the wind isn&rsquo;t blowing or the sun isn&rsquo;t shining. For example, in a recent 30 day period, 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was provided by wind generation. However, over this same period, one day had only 4% of our electricity provided by wind and on another day it provided 62% of our electricity. </p></reply>

Ireland welcomes the benefits that the enhanced connectivity and technology will bring.  </p><p>It is expected that 5G will be commercialised over the next few years. Rollout in Ireland is primarily a matter for private mobile network operators, operating on a commercial basis. I have no role or function in this.</p><p>However, as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have policy responsibility for matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation. Irish policy in this area is informed by a substantial volume of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence. This includes the guidelines set down by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the ICNIRP. </p><p>These guidelines provide scientifically-based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure from electromagnetic fields (EMF), including 5G. ICNIRP guidelines apply up to a frequency of 300 gigahertz (GHz), well above the maximum frequencies being considered for 5G. ComReg, the independent telecoms regulatory authority, ensures that licensed mobile operators comply with their licence conditions and do not exceed ICNIRP guidelines. </p><p>In 2015, the Irish Government commissioned a report by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM). This was published in 2016 and is entitled <i>&ldquo;Electromagnetic Fields in the Irish Context&rdquo;</i>. It examined and synthesised existing peer-reviewed research into clear findings, with particular focus on the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields arising from high voltage power lines, and electromagnetic fields from base stations for mobile communication. This report reaffirms the overall conclusion of an earlier 2007 report, <i>&ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;</i>, that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects. </p><p>This is an area that is kept under review and earlier this year I assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency to provide general information to the public on matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionising radiation, to monitor international scientific developments and provide independent advice to my Department in this area.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific or Strategic Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the recession meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take time. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to local authorities to fund works on these roads from its own resources. It is also open to the local authorities to undertake rehabilitation works on these roads under their Restoration Improvement Grant programmes.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. </p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your questions to TII for a direct reply.

In Action 97 Government has committed to revise transport infrastructure programmes to achieve at least 10% expenditure on facilitating cycling by Q4 2020.  My Department is currently examining the Action and its implementation in line with that timeline.</p><p>Currently, funding for active travel, including cycling, is provided under many programmes across both my Department and indeed wider Government.</p><p>My Department supports cycling through several programmes &ndash;</p><p>-  The Cycling/Walking programme, administered by the National Transport Authority (NTA);</p><p>-  The Sustainable Urban Transport programme, administered by the NTA;</p><p>-  BusConnects, administered by the NTA; </p><p>-  The Greenways Strategy, administered by my Department; and</p><p>-  The Roads programme, administered by my Department and by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.</p><p>Funding allocated in 2019 under the cycling/walking and the sustainable urban transport programmes alone is around &euro;48 million (almost 18% of the NTA's proposed capital investment programme for the year). In 2018, funding for these two programmes equated to approximately 15% of the NTA's capital investment programme.</p><p>Across the wider Government area there are three important funding programmes available to support a wide range of initiatives including active travel, and/or leisure orientated walking and cycling, -</p><p>-  Project Ireland 2040&rsquo;s Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government;</p><p>-  Project Ireland 2040&rsquo;s Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development; and</p><p>-  The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development with supplementary supports available through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, an agency under the aegis of my Department.</p><p>In addition funding is also available at a European level through the European Structural and Investment Funds Programme and the INTERREG programme which complement funding made available under the national programmes referred to above.</p><p>Cycling is also supported through the fiscal incentives available under the Cycle to Work Scheme which has proven very successful.</p><p>My Department will be examining the totality of all this taxpayer support for active travel, as part of our implementation of Action 97 of the Climate Action Plan 2019.</p><p>The Deputy has asked for data on percentages for cycling expenditure by my Department in recent years. Owing to the nature of the funding programmes under which cycling has been supported, it is not possible to specifically isolate the cycling element of the various investments that benefit cycling. </p><p>Therefore, the table below indicates the percentage of the capital investment under the Transport, Tourism and Sport Vote which was for the Sustainable Transport Measures Grants Programme, Regional Cities Programme, Smarter Travel/Sustainable Urban Transport Programme, Cycling &amp;amp; Walking Programme and Greenways, where relevant over the 5 year period. Spend in this area relates mainly to capital, accordingly current spend is not included. Variances to the percentage figures may occur from year to year due to the time various programmes cease or commence, along with changes to the overall Department budget, in particular at times when significant infrastructural projects are underway. </p><p><table><tr><th><b>2014</b></th><th><b>2015</b></th><th><b>2016</b></th><th><b>2017</b></th><th><b>2018</b></th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4.4</td><td>6.0 </td><td>3.8 </td><td>2.2 </td><td>3.1 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Any new routes would have to be considered and approved by the ECF.  It is worth noting however, that, as the Eurovelo concept is for a pan-European network of linear routes, it does not include circular national routes, which the extension of EV1 from Rosslare to Larne would create.  Eurovelo 1 - Atlantic Coast Route &ndash; starts in Norway and traverses Scotland and Northern Ireland before entering this State, it then traverses Wales, England, France and Spain before terminating in Portugal.</p>  <p>  My Department has funded the identification of Eurovelo 1 which is mostly on-road, with some sections of Greenway, from Donegal to Rosslare. It is expected that this route, which will be fully mapped by year-end, will be sign-posted in 2020. Some sections of EV1 may, in time, become Greenways or the route may alter to include newly completed Greenways.</p>  <p>  With regard to Eurovelo Route 2, the Capitals Route, the section from Maynooth to Athlone is now complete comprising the Royal Canal Greenway to Mullingar and the Old Rail Trail Greenway from Mullingar to Athlone.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-25a.379.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092500070#WRJ03700"><p>The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance.  A half-rate Carer's Allowance is also payable with other welfare payments. </p>  <p>  The conditions attached to payments of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.  This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn an income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  The continued application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  </p>  <p>  Deductions included for Carer's Allowance include PRSI, union dues, superannuation (pension contributions) and travel expenses. This is in line with most social assistance payments.  The proposal by the Deputy to assess means on net disposable income minus family expenses could potentially include taking account of  costs such as mortgage repayments, dependent children, college fees, Fair Deal contributions, medical costs, etc. Any such change to include other costs and deductions in the calculation of income would have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes. It would also significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment and inevitably prolong the assessment process. </p>  <p>  The formula for assessing means from capital (savings, shares and property) for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance whereby the first &euro;20,000 of capital is disregarded is line with most social assistance schemes.  The assessment of capital reflects an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital, or to realise the value of the property, to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment.</p>  <p>  The matter of making the payment exempt from tax is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  </p>  <p>  In assessing weekly family income for Working Family Payment (WFP) purposes, most weekly social welfare payments are assessed.  Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments. Moreover, while this measure reduced a person&rsquo;s secondary payment (WFP) it did so without affecting their primary payment, in this case Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, therefore targeting available resources at those in most need.</p>  <p>  For Working Family Payment purposes, any combination of hours that reaches 38 hours each fortnight is acceptable. A person can combine their weekly hours with their spouse, civil partner, cohabitant's hours to meet the condition.  Therefore a carer&rsquo;s working hours can be taken into account for WFP purposes.  To take into account the hours worked by a carer for WFP purposes and to not assess the income into the household generated by those hours would be inequitable in terms of how income from all other earnings is assessed.    </p>  <p>  Finally, as of end of July 2019, there were 82,015 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million. Any changes to qualifying criteria for these schemes, including income disregards, would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As of end of July 2019, there were 82,015 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The projected expenditure on Carer's Allowance in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million. </p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  However, in order to support a carers continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 15-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2006,the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  </p>  <p>  Any further changes to this condition would need to be considered in a budgetary context and would also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the requirement to provide full-time care for the care recipient and the needs of the carer.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main purpose of these Agreements is to protect the pension rights of people who have worked and paid social security contributions in Ireland and the countries with which Ireland has such agreements. This is achieved by allowing reckonable social security contributions paid in one or more of these countries to be aggregated with Irish full-rate social insurance contributions for the purposes of qualifying for certain contributory payments in Ireland or in these countries. The Agreements also deal with the social security status of workers who are sent on temporary assignments from one country to the other.</p>  <p>  The Bilateral Agreements with Austria and the Swiss Confederation have subsequently been superseded by the EU Regulations on the Coordination of Social Security Systems following Austria&rsquo;s accession to the EU and the application of those Regulations to the Swiss Confederation.</p>  <p>  The EU provides common rules to protect social security rights when a person moves within the EU, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.  There are four main principles involved in these rules &ndash;</p>  <p>  1. A person can only be covered by the legislation of one country at a  time, so that they are required only to pay contributions in one country.    </p>  <p>  2. Persons moving from one EU country to another have the same rights and obligations as nationals of the country that they moves to (known as the principle of equal treatment or non-discrimination).</p>  <p>  3. In the case of persons who have moved from one EU country to another and who claim a benefit, their previous periods of insurance, work or residence in other countries are taken into account if necessary (known as the principle of aggregation).</p>  <p>  4. Persons who are entitled to a cash benefit from one EU country may generally receive this benefit even if they are living in a different country (known as the principle of exportability).</p></reply>

The letter confirming this initial support also outlined agreement in principle to further URDF support for this project.</p><p>While there is agreement in principle to provide further URDF support for the overall project, its complexity means that its proposed composition, costs and sequencing must be refined and further examined so that the precise level of URDF support can be established, and apportioned to the various individual project components.  This includes consideration of any funding commitment to the project that may go beyond the current capital funding envelope for the URDF under the National Development Plan.  In that context, it is worth noting that Project Ireland 2040 has provided for a &euro;2 billion URDF programme operating on a multi-annual basis over the period to 2027.  </p></reply>

Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.</p>  <p>  The full terms and conditions of the scheme are being finalised, again in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process will take account of the engagement that my Department is currently having with both Donegal and Mayo County Councils. In this regard, officials from my Department continue to meet with both local authority teams to discuss implementation arrangements for the scheme and further engagement will take place over the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  On completion of this work, it is intended to revert to Government on the matter. The aim will be to complete the outstanding work without delay in order to ensure that the scheme can get underway as early as possible.</p>  <p>  In regard to the issue of personnel hired by the local authority to facilitate the implementation process, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is the Chief Executive of the Council who is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority.  Consequently, the information requested is not available in my Department and is a matter for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

Accordingly, under existing arrangements, a household that applies, for example, to Dublin City Council can, if qualified for support and should they choose to do so, be entered on the waiting list of three of the four local authorities in Dublin city and county.</p>  <p>  All four Dublin authorities have provisions in their allocation schemes for inter authority/mutual transfers for sitting tenants whereby the authority is prepared to accommodate applications for inter authority/mutual transfers provided certain criteria are met. All four Dublin authorities also make provision in their allocation schemes for households wishing to move to a home more suitable to their household needs. However, decisions on all applications are entirely a matter for the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, a commitment has been given to examine the possibility of introducing a &ldquo;housing passport&rdquo;. The basic premise is that households in receipt of, or qualified for, social housing support in one local authority area could potentially transfer to, or be allocated, social housing in another local authority area. This will offer more flexibility and choice to social housing applicants and tenants on a national basis. I am currently finalising proposals in relation to this matter. It is my intention to bring forward any proposed changes needed to implement the housing passport proposal to Government as part of a comprehensive social housing reform package of measures in the near future. A key aim of the package will be to ensure that social housing supports are more responsive and flexible to the varying needs that exist at different stages of the life cycle of a social housing tenant. The issue raised by the Deputy in respect of tenants wishing to right-size clearly falls within this broader policy objective.</p>  <p>  In the context of older people, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, published a joint policy statement, Housing Options for our Ageing Population, on 27 February 2019, which builds on policy as outlined in Rebuilding Ireland and the National Planning Framework 2040. The statement sets out forty actions which the two Departments want to progress with a view to developing new models of housing and supports for older people.  These include options in relation to rightsizing in both public and private housing.  An independently chaired implementation group is working to drive progress on the actions and to ensure that there is an integrated approach to their development over the timescales set out in the statement.</p></reply>

The right of local authorities to set and collect rents on their dwellings is laid down in section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. The making or amending of such schemes is an executive function and is subject to broad principles laid down by my Department including that &ndash;</p>  <p>  - the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households;</p>  <p>  - provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and</p>  <p>  - appropriate local factors should be taken into account including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has its own separate differential rent scheme or schemes in operation. As rent is calculated using each local authority&rsquo;s own formula, the schemes do vary in a number of ways from each other.  This is particularly the case when it comes to what may or may not be considered as reckonable/assessable income for rent purposes e.g., disability allowance and carer's allowance. However, all local authority rent schemes would include the employment income of the tenant and most would do so based on net income, that is income net of income tax, Universal Social Charge and PRSI. </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides for the Minister to introduce a national rents framework for social housing tenants. Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft of such a framework, which has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.  </p>  <p>  This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes. I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>
