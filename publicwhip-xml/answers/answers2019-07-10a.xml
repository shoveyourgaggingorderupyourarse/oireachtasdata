Our discussions focused on the high-level appointments, although we also exchanged views on other EU and international issues. I also had a bilateral meeting with the new Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, and spoke by phone with President Anastasiades of Cyprus, who was unable to attend the meeting. </p><p>I spoke with Prime Minister Michel following the meeting, and congratulated him on his election as the next President of the European Council. </p><p>The other candidates for the high-level appointments were not present at the meeting. However, I look forward to working very closely with them over the period ahead.</p></reply>

Hon David Lidington MP  on Friday 28 June.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Richard Bruton TD.    </p>  <p>  First Ministers from Scotland, Wales along with Heads of Administration from the Crown Dependencies also attended the summit meeting. </p>  <p>  The discussion at the summit covered key political developments for Administrations since the last summit in November.  The discussion focused largely on the implications of Brexit, particularly for relationships across the islands.  The Council also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and I again reiterated my regret that Northern Ireland, until the Executive is restored, continues to be without political representation in this important forum.  </p>  <p>  Building on the shared goal of decarbonising our economies, Minister Bruton took part in a thematic discussion to explore how best we can facilitate the transition by smartening our energy systems.  Ministers explored policy approaches to enabling this transition, the facilitation of key technologies, smart energy at a local scale and funding for innovation.</p>  <p>  The Council also received an update on the BIC Marine Litter event held in Glasgow in February.</p>  <p>  I took the opportunity to have bilateral discussions with Rt. Hon David Lidington, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and with First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford who was attending his first summit meeting.  In all meetings we exchanged views on issues of mutual interest and continued co-operation with discussions focusing mainly on Brexit and its impacts on business and citizens. We also spoke on developments in Westminster and Brussels. </p>  <p>  At my meeting with FM Sturgeon we also discussed developments in relation to Rockall and agreed that  our shared aim is to resolve differences in a way which benefit both countries, and to develop further an already strong bilateral relationship.</p>  <p>  Following the summit I officially opened the new ESB energy offices in Manchester where I attended  Enterprise Ireland's first Business CEO Roundtable with Irish companies operating in the UK's &ldquo;Northern Powerhouse&rdquo; region.  I also met with the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham and visited the Sisk development at Circle Square.</p></reply>

Tusla is one of many employers of social workers in Ireland and it is competing with other employments that are often perceived as less challenging.</p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s new Strategic Workforce Planning Model will be accompanied by a renewed focus on retention of social workers and other key staff.  This approach should ensure better outcomes for children and for Tusla&rsquo;s recruitment work.</p><p>In 2019, Tusla Recruit, its dedicated in-house recruitment function, has managed 16 social work specific campaigns such as:</p><p>- the Social Work Graduate Programme designed to recruit new graduates,</p><p>- the rolling campaign for Professionally Qualified Social Workers (PQSW),</p><p>- Social Work Team Lead,</p><p>- Senior Social Work Practitioner, and </p><p>- Principal Social Worker. </p><p>These campaigns have attracted approximately 550 applications from internal and external applicants to date. As at 31<sup>st</sup>May, 2019, Tusla was ahead of its 2019 social work recruitment schedule,  with 114 new starter social workers appointed.</p><p>59 social workers resigned or retired during the same period, resulting in a net gain of 63 whole time equivalent social workers since the start of 2019.</p><p>In addition to Tusla&rsquo;s Social Work Graduate Programme and its annual calendar of college campus visits, Tusla held its first Social Work Recruitment Open Day on the 14<sup>th</sup>of June. The Open Day provided an opportunity for potential applicants to learn about a career with Tusla from experienced frontline staff.</p><p>I also welcome the news that Tusla Recruit expects to launch online interviews from autumn 2019 to accommodate applicants, in particular those who may be abroad.</p><p>I understand Tusla has also established a Retention Steering Group to plan and implement an integrated approach to retention throughout the organisation via Tusla&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing and Employee Assistance Programme. The Group will:</p><p>- review current retention initiatives;</p><p>- identify opportunities and barriers to successfully retaining talent;</p><p>- act upon the findings of the Tusla's Staff Retention Survey;</p><p>- harness insights and ideas from across the organisation to incorporate into policies and working practices; and</p><p>- consider successful initiatives developed by other Agencies. </p><p>The work of the Retention Steering Group will be an important input for the implementation of Tusla&rsquo;s Strategic Workforce Planning Model.I note that the turnover rate for social workers at 31 May, 2019 is 7.17% compared to 8.44% for the same period in 2018. Hopefully this is an indication that Tusla is already reaping benefits from its actions in this area.</p><p>My Department has also taken the initiative to establish the Social Work Education Group, which is intended to provide a forum for Tusla and other stakeholders to raise issues and act upon possible actions to influence the future supply of social workers.</p><p>The first priority identified by the Group is the streamlining of student placements and I am pleased to confirm work has commenced on this.</p></reply>

I have pushed for investment to address affordability and access for parents, but also quality for children and the 26,000 staff working in centred based childcare. </p>  <p>  Current pay rates, and the availability of only part-time / part-year contracts for many who work in the sector, do not reflect the level of responsibility that early learning and care professionals hold, nor the value of their work. We have a long way to go to rectify this situation, but I can assure the Deputy that I am doing everything in my power. </p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions. I have instead repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is underway. </p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions.  </p>  <p>  These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for School-Age Childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.  </p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5. This strategy commits to a Workforce Development Plan, to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group for the Workforce Development Plan met for the first time on 30th May, and the Stakeholder Group held its first meeting earlier this week. First 5 also commits to develop a new funding model for the sector, which may open up new mechanisms to influence pay and conditions.  </p></reply>

Tusla's funding has increased from &euro;609m in 2014, a rise of some 29.3% over five years. </p><p>In common with many other public agencies, Tusla faces challenges in delivery of a quality service for children and families within a finite budget. In its Business Plan for 2019, Tusla identified a number of challenges, relating to the increasing cost of some services, and the continuing shortage of social workers and other professionals in the labour market. </p><p>Among the key drivers of costs for Tusla is in the area of residential services for our most vulnerable  young people - those whose needs can only be met in a residential environment rather than with a foster family. </p><p>Another key driver relates to the increasing number of child protection and welfare referrals. For example in April, 2019, Tusla received 4,903 child protection and welfare referrals which is an increase of 852 (21%) since  January 2019. This reflects a pattern of increasing referrals over time, which Tusla is dealing with.  </p><p>The monthly average number of referrals in 2019 to date is some 5% higher than the monthly average in 2018. </p><p>Tusla is working with my Department to ensure that it provides a full range of services within budget. </p><p>In relation to staffing, Tusla continues its work to recruit sufficient numbers of staff including social workers. In this context, it is important to note that  all necessary funding has been provided for social worker and social care worker posts.  </p><p>The challenge in this area lies in the ability to recruit and retain staff rather than the availability of resources to fund them. </p><p>My Department will continue  to work closely with Tusla in relation to service and  funding issues throughout the current year. </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, good progress has been made in this regard, with an increase in investment in this area of 117% over the past four budgets (increasing from &euro;260m in 2015 to nearly &euro;574m in Budget 2019).  </p><p>Within these four budgets, a significant amount of exchequer funding was made available for childcare providers, whether private or community / not for profit organisations, to apply for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare capital grants. Capital funding is aimed at increasing the capacity of existing services, creating new services, and maintaining and improving existing services. </p><p>Each year my Department reviews the capital programmes as a whole and determines the priorities for Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital grants. This consideration necessarily has regard to many factors, including the financial resources available. </p><p>In 2019, my Department focused the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare Capital programme on the expansion of early learning and care places for 0-3 year olds, and school age childcare places where this is most needed.</p><p>The capital strands have been made available to achieve the strategic priorities for 2019 as determined by my Department, having regard to the funding available. These were developed using analysis of the current state of the childcare sector, learnings from previous capital programmes and feedback and input from stakeholders, including childcare providers and Pobal.</p><p>The approved Early Learning and School Age Capital funding for 2019 was made available to childcare centres, cr&egrave;ches and other childcare facilities across three strands, as follows:</p><p><b>Strand A (Early Learning and Care): New places for 0-3 year olds</b></p><p><b>- &euro;3.7m</b>total approved (&euro;50k max. grant)</p><p><b>- 87</b>applications approved for funding</p><p><b>- 1,321</b>new 0-3 places to be created: <b>205 0-1</b>places, <b>1,116</b><b>1-3 </b>places</p><p><b>Strand B</b><b>(Early Learning and Care): Fire safety improvements (community only)</b></p><p><b>- &euro;0.3m</b>total approved (&euro;15k max. grant)</p><p><b>- 33 </b>applications approved for funding</p><p><b>Strand C</b><b>(School Age): New places for school age children</b></p><p><b>- &euro;2.2m</b>total approved (&euro;20k max. grant)</p><p><b>- 118 </b>applications approved for funding</p><p><b>- 2,308 </b>new school age places to be created.</p><p>The capital funding has been awarded following the completion of a very competitive application and appraisal process. </p><p>Pobal have notified all applicants of the outcomes of the Capital decisions. </p><p>In addition to the annual capital programme, I negotiated that childcare be identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan (2018-2027). &euro;250m in capital funding was secured for childcare under the Plan. This represents the kind of large scale investment in the sector by the State that has not been seen since the  National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) that concluded in 2010.</p><p>This investment will be essential to respond to the increased capacity we expect as the new National Childcare Scheme is introduced. The NCS will radically change how this country supports the cost to parents of early learning and care and school age childcare.</p><p>Research is on-going to determine areas of specific need that the NDP funding will address when it comes on stream in the coming years. The exact shape and priorities of this funding is currently being developed and information will be made publicas it becomes available.</p></reply>

DCYA funds 30 Childcare Committees across the country to support providers and parents. The local childcare Committee is an important source of expertise and information for providers and their local knowledge often proves helpful in addressing challenges. </p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal in cooperation with the local Childcare Committee.  A dedicated team assess services facing sustainability challenges, and may be able to offer advice and non-financial support in respect of the specific circumstances reported by these services. I would therefore recommend that the services in question also contact Pobal. However, I do note that while my Department does provide funding to assist childcare providers through specific challenges to their sustainability, such as emergency relocations, these supports are currently only available to community not for profit services. </p>  <p>  In the event that the services are unable to remain open while renovations are carried out, the local Childcare Committee will offer assistance to parents in finding alternative places for their children should this be required.</p></reply>

This will support the growing demand for childcare.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan will enable parents who use childminders to benefit from subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme.

This is an increase of &euro;8.5m from the youth funding provided in 2016. This level of funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the youth work sector.  The additional funding will be used to support programmes in areas where there are disadvantaged young people and where there is a pressing need for targeted services to meet the needs of young people. </p>  <p>  The Targeted Youth Funding Scheme has been allocated &euro;35.18 million for 2019 to provide out of school supports to young people in their local communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential by strengthening their personal and social competencies.

Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State as well as an Area Profiling, Needs Assessment and a Service Requirement tool which was designed in collaboration with the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector and was officially launched in January 2019.

In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to make work pay for parents. Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive.</p><p>By making this shift and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.</p><p>The Scheme has already been enhanced to expand the benefits for working families. As part of Budget 2019, the income thresholds used for assessing the level of subsidy to which a parent may be entitled were raised.</p><p>The significant increase in the Scheme's maximum <b>net income </b>threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000 per annum enables some families with a gross income of &euro;100,000 to qualify for income-related subsidies.  It means that an estimated 7,500 more children will benefit from the scheme relative to the original proposals.  Over 40,000 other children, already eligible, will see increases to their subsidies.</p><p>I am also very pleased that I have managed to adjust the lower income threshold, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a <b>net</b>annual income of up to &euro;26,000 (up from &euro;22,700).  This &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme. It will also make work pay for parents in employment or training as they will now be able to avail of help with their childcare costs.</p><p>Over the last four budgets, investment in childcare has risen by nearly 117%.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution.  The new National Childcare Scheme will establish a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come.  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.</p></reply>

As of 31 December 2018, the total funding provided to the ABC Programme was &euro;38.7m. Of this, &euro;23.85m was provided by DCYA and &euro;14.85m by The Atlantic Philanthropies. With the closure of The Atlantic Philanthropies operations in Ireland, DCYA is now the sole funder of the ABC Programme. </p>  <p>  In November 2017, my Department initiated a process, in consultation with key ABC Programme stakeholders, to consider options for sustaining the work of the ABC Programme within a new vision for a community based prevention and early intervention programme from 2019 and beyond. Following these consultations, the decision was taken to transfer the current ABC Programme to Tusla from September 2019 as part of the national Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (PPFS). For 2019, a budget of &euro;9.5m has been allocated to the ABC and PPFS Programmes.  &euro;8.2m has been ring-fenced for the ABC Programme in 2019. A further &euro;1.3m has been allocated for the PPFS Programme which will include two new national roles to support the ABC Programme.</p>  <p>  The Development and Mainstreaming Programme for Prevention, Partnership and Family Support (PPFS) is a programme of action being undertaken by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as part of its National Service Delivery Framework. The programme seeks to strengthen and develop Tusla&rsquo;s prevention, early intervention and family support services. </p>  <p>  PPFS was subject to an evaluation study by the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre at NUI Galway, published in September 2018. The evaluation found that Tusla is developing a greater focus on prevention and that the agency&rsquo;s organisational culture is increasingly inclusive of families, in line with the vision for PPFS. PPFS is currently undertaking a review process to ensure it delivers the best possible prevention and early intervention programme for children, young people and their families in the future, and to enhance the connectivity and alignment with the ABC programme as it completes its transition into Tusla.</p>  <p>  In addition, a working group was established in May 2018 to support the transition into this new national structure that can build on the achievements to date in both the ABC and PPFS Programmes, and strengthen Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention operations. This working group held its eighth meeting on 25 June 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of this national structure, the ABC Programme will take a renewed focus on addressing child poverty and inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives, improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland. In recognition of the need to further develop this mandate, research is being led locally and nationally by the Child and Family Research Centre to explore the potential of the ABC programme operation into the future in the context of the new organisational structure and the expectation that the programme will renew its emphasis on tackling child poverty. The outputs from this will include a document to inform the longer-term development of the ABC programme and a set of local area reports to guide future operation of the ABCs locally within their new organisational context.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that AIM - the Access and Inclusion Model - provides both universal and targeted supports for the meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE pre-school programme. The third year of AIM's operation is just ending, and work on a 3-year evaluation of AIM will shortly commence. A review at the end of the first year of AIM, conducted by external consultants, was very positive, and indeed AIM has won a number of national awards.</p><p>The Government made a commitment in <i>First 5 </i>to consider enhancements to, or extension of, AIM to other groups of children. Such an extension might involve younger children (such as under-3s) or children attending school-age childcare services, or it might involve children with additional needs other than a disability. However, any decisions on extension or reform of AIM will depend on the findings of the 3-year evaluation, other relevant developments, and the securing of necessary resources.</p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that on 21st May I launched a public consultation on the future regulation and quality standards for school-age childcare, and this consultation ended last week. The consultation included an open call for submissions, an online survey, a focus group session with school-age service providers, and an Open Policy Debate with a wide range of stakeholders. The consultation has provided rich information for consideration by my Department, and the findings may provide additional input into consideration of future supports for accessing school-age childcare.</p></reply>

Many of the major elements are now in place in preparation for the Scheme&rsquo;s opening in October 2019.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Childcare Support Act 2018, detailed secondary legislation and policy guidelines are now being finalised for my approval and signature. </p><p>I have formally appointed Pobal as Scheme Administrator under section 3 of the Act.  This has enabled Pobal to open a Parent Phoneline.  The phoneline is now available to assist parents or guardians with any queries on the new National Childcare Scheme.</p><p>Providers have been invited to sign-up for the Scheme and I am delighted that, to date, over 2,300 have done so.</p><p>A national communications campaign is underway.  As part of this, my Department launched a dedicated website, which has received over 185,000 hits, and distributed over 60,000 parent information booklets nationwide.  It also delivered a nationwide training programme to over 3,500 Early Years professionals. </p><p>In September and October, my Department will undertake further training for providers and will run a large multimedia information campaign to ensure parents are aware of their potential entitlements. </p><p>Of course the development of the Scheme is highly complex and has thrown up challenges.  This would be expected with a scheme of this size which will benefit so many families across Ireland.</p><p>We are designing a highly innovative supporting IT system for the Scheme so that we have the option of a user-friendly, paperless, automated assessment process for parents.  While the main IT system to deal with online applications is largely built, work is continuing on the supporting structures to deal with postal applications. With this in mind the experts overseeing development of the Scheme have recommended a phased launch approach.  </p><p>In accordance with the expert advice, we are working towards delivery online, on time, in October.  The paper based system will be available in January for those who do not wish to apply online. </p><p>I believe that this is the best way to proceed, so that the maximum number of parents can benefit from the new scheme at the earliest possible date.  </p><p>The Deputy has also asked about supporting low income parents.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to incentivise work and training or education for those parents who can engage in same.  </p><p>Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive. For example, a family with a child aged two in full-time care (40 hours) and currently benefiting from the maximum subsidy of &euro;145 per week under CCS Band A, would see their subsidy increase to &euro;174 per week, an additional subsidisation of &euro;1,500 per annum. </p><p>I have also worked to poverty-proof the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme. Indeed, international reports have stated that the Scheme will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11<sup>th</sup>position.</p><p>Finally, arrangements are also in place to ensure that no one loses out in the initial transition to the new Scheme.  Once the National Childcare Scheme launches, families can choose to switch over to the new Scheme or can continue to access their current targeted supports (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until the end of August 2020. My Department has committed to a review of the scheme one year after its commencement,and again at three years, but we will be closely monitoring the scheme and its impact on families from day one.</p></reply>

These policies seek to support children&rsquo;s optimal development, to support families, and to ensure that families can choose options to best suit their needs and preferences. </p>  <p>  All children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school, without cost.  Almost 108,000 children are currently participating, many of whom are children of stay-at-home parents. </p>  <p>  Current targeted ELC and SAC subsidy schemes are available to families where parents are in receipt of certain social welfare payments, medical cards, or GP Visit cards, many of whom are stay-at-home parents. </p>  <p>  A universal subsidy is available to all parents of children from six months until their child becomes eligible for universal pre-school, regardless of whether parents are working outside the home or not. The National Childcare Scheme which will be open for applications later this year will make subsidies available on the basis of family income and will also be available to stay-at-home parents. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents participate.  449 groups were supported in 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new model of parenting services covering key stages of child development and taking account of parents and children in a range of contexts and parenting relationships. </p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children. Budget 2019 announced an increase to the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,500 per year. </p>  <p>  There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.  Budget 2019 announced the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme which will be available to both fathers and mothers from later this year.   </p>  <p>  First 5, a Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, published in November 2018, includes over 150 actions including a broad a range of measures to support families given their fundamental importance in shaping children&rsquo;s experiences and outcomes. The First 5 Implementation Plan, published in May, sets out how these actions, many of which will benefit stay-at-home parents, will be progressed in the coming three years.   </p></reply>

As such, and following collaboration with Minister Daly, who has responsibility for this brief, both departments established a Working Group in 2018 to scope connectivity in the area of youth mental health. </p>  <p>  The group is made up of senior officials from both Departments with representatives from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency and the Health Service Executive.</p>  <p>  The key objective of the working group is to examine psychological and mental health services for children and young people with the aim of agreeing a clearer continuum of provision and strengthening alignment between providers. </p>  <p>  In order to secure the best possible output it is essential to establish complete and up-to-date information on current provision. My officials have been working with Tusla to establish greater clarity around existing service availability and provision, with a view to ensuring that all respective inputs from the agencies provide a comprehensive overview of provision in this area. Under the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013 Tusla has responsibility for services relating to the psychological welfare of children and families but not for more acute services focusing on complex developmental issues and disabilities and more severe mental health problems. Community-based psychological services are delivered by the HSE with financial support from Tusla. Tusla also deliver specific psychological services through the Assessment Consultation Therapy Service (ACTS). ACTS provides multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla and the HSE have in place both a Memorandum of Understanding and a Joint Protocol for inter-agency collaboration among the two organisations. Discussions are ongoing between the two organisations to ensure collaboration is effective and sustained.</p>  <p>  A key initiative that will inform the further advancement of the work of the group is the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project, being led by the Department of Health. The operationalisation and resourcing of this Pathfinder Project is, I understand, currently under consideration by the Department of Expenditure and Reform. As this project represents the key development to ensure and enhance a robust response to support youth mental health, it is important that the work of the Working Group and indeed our respective departments align with this initiative. It is anticipated that the work advanced to date by the Working Group will directly inform the work of the Pathfinder Project and its programme of work. Centralising the work in this way will provide a clear overview of existing provision and proposed plans from across the relevant departments and agencies so as to identify gaps in provision, areas of alignment and areas for further development. </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and with colleagues in our respective agencies, will continue to support efforts in addressing this crucial issue in a strategic and collaborative response, with the key aim of ensuring aligned and accessible youth mental health policy and service provision.</p></reply>

In April 2019 this amounted to  370 young people.  Individual residential settings care for  small numbers of children, often no more than two or three. </p>  <p>  All centres are inspected against the relevant standards and regulations and  the majority of inspections show evidence of positive relationships between staff and young people, and that the needs of the young people being met.  In addition, Tulsa registers private centres and conditions are placed on the registration of private centres who fall below the standards expected, for instance the number of children in the centre.  Centres that are struggling to meet standards do not survive in such a regulated environment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asks about staffing and resourcing in residential centres. I have been concerned to learn that in some centres there is a high turnover of staff and a dependency on agency staff. I am also aware of injuries sustained by some staff in the course of their work and the impact this has on stability in the centre.</p>  <p>  Residential care is a small, but vital part of our care system and the basis for successful outcomes for the young people who live in residential settings relies on the experience, quality and resilience of the management and staff group in each centre. </p>  <p>  My officials have been engaged with Tusla on the challenges posed in residential care and work is ongoing to provide a greater level of assessment and therapeutic input to the centres from the ACTS Team (Assessment, Counselling, Therapy and Support Team).</p>  <p>   I also welcome CORU's upcoming accreditation of Social Care Courses and registration of Social Care Workers, as I believe this will lead to the enhancement of professional social care as the lead profession in working with troubled young people. </p></reply>

If the Deputy has a specific case in mind I would encourage them to send any relevant correspondence on to me. </p>  <p>  I am aware that there are cases where natural parents have concerns about invasion of privacy in the context of an adopted person seeking contact. In particular I am conscious of cases where natural mothers fear that they will have no say as to whether they could be contacted.  </p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is concerned with individual&rsquo;s access to information, rather than establishing contact between people. Notwithstanding this, the Adoption (information and Tracing) Bill 2016 recognises that there can be a conflict between the right to privacy of one party, and the right to information on the part of another. The Bill seeks to balance these rights. I have engaged at length with the Attorney General on this very issue.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I recently informed the Seanad that the legal advice available to me is that the natural parent&rsquo;s constitutional right to privacy must be reflected in the legislation. I am currently engaging with members of the Oireachtas and with stakeholder groups to reach a consensus on balancing these rights which will allow the legislation to progress.  </p>  <p>  Pending the outcome of these engagements, I hope to be in a position to bring the Bill back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the autumn.</p></reply>

In July 2018 I brought the high-level scheme outline to Government for Information; this outline was arrived at following detailed consultation with the sector and young people, relevant evidence review and a sampling process. The outline stated that young people aged 10 to 24 years of age who are described in the National Youth Strategy (NYS) as marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable will be the primary target group for services available through the TYFS.</p>  <p>  This outline has since provided the basis for further development of the scheme, the final drafting process of which is currently underway. In addition to development of the new scheme, significant other changes have been introduced including; in January of this year, four funding streams were successfully collapsed in to one scheme in advance of the introduction of the new scheme in 2020. In April 2019, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) was signed between my Department and each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) and the process of transferring funds to their functional ETB area began on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Throughout this reform my Department has been engaging proactively with the stakeholders and sample services in relation to various component of the new scheme. In 2018, 6 ETBs participated in a trial and co-design of the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement Tool (APNARS). The tool is designed to enable Education and Training Boards (ETB), who have a mid-level governance role in the new youth funding scheme, to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their ETB functional area to enable better targeting of services for young people. Based on the information gathered, the ETB analyse the needs of young people in the area and consider the extent to which these needs are being met within existing youth service provision. Completing the tool provides ETBs with a systematic and evidence-informed assessment of needs to inform judgements about priorities for service provision. It also ensures that youth services/projects funded under the new scheme are focused on working to meet the identified needs and key issues in the area in line with the stated objectives of the new scheme. The tool also provides a standardised national template for producing an area profile, needs assessment and Service Requirement document across all ETBs. The tool is a critical component in an evidence-informed approach to providing well targeted services to young people. Service Requirement documents will issue from ETBs to services/projects who are applying for funding through the grant application process on the targeted groups and key issues that are priority. </p></reply>

Recruitment to the AR and NSR is continuing. I am advised by the military authorities that as of 30 June 2019, a total of 66 new recruits have been inducted into the RDF in 2019. Of these, 57 (3 female) have been inducted into the AR and 9 (2 female) have been inducted into the NSR. A total of 129 new recruits were inducted to the AR and NSR in 2018.</p><p>Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members.

In the lead up to the 29 March deadline, the European Union adopted 18 primary legislative measures on a unilateral temporary basis to mitigate the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit, in a range of areas, from transport, fisheries, social security and PEACE/INTERREG funding, to education (Erasmus), mobility and trade.</p>  <p>  At a national level, we continue to advance our extensive and detailed Brexit contingency work, including with our EU partners, to make sure Ireland is ready to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  This work is set out in detail in the updated Contingency Action Plan published yesterday. The Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update reflects the extensive work which has taken place on a whole-of-Government basis to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, and the work that will take place between now and 31 October. The Action Plan shows that while extensive mitigation work has taken place, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit will still be profound. This is an exercise in damage limitation.</p>  <p>  Key areas for continued work will include preparing for Budget 2020, additional infrastructure for ports and airports, a new phase of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit communications including an intensified engagement focussed on individual businesses.</p></reply>

Staffing of the elections desk is proportionate to its budget and that of the Division as a whole, whose purpose is to deliver on the objectives set out in <i>A Better World</i>, the Government's policy for international development published in February 2019.  A review of the management of the election roster will be conducted by the Department's independent Evaluation and Audit Unit later this year.</p><p>The budget of the Irish Aid programme (known as Vote 27: International Cooperation) of my Department from 2013 to 2019 is set out in the following table.  The table also includes the election observation budget.  A new five-year roster was established in January 2019 and will run its course. The increase in the budget for election observation in 2018 was in part to offset the costs of the mustering exercise which allowed the establishment of that new five-year roster.  A mid-year review of the election observation budget is carried out each year and, if necessary, prudent and proportionate to other calls on the international development budget, additional funds may be allocated.</p><p>As the security vetting of the persons short-listed to the new roster continues, the position regarding the disclosure of the list of names of the new roster remains as stated in the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 73 of 29 May and 117 of 25 June 2019.  Roster members are only circulated with information on election observation missions once they have completed National Vetting Bureau, or equivalent, procedures.</p><p>The issue of reasonable accommodation has been addressed in the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 60 of 23 January, 153 of 5 February, 65 of 6 February, 58 of 7 February, 124 of 12 February, 100 and 105 of 26 February, 117 and 119 of 5 March, 74, 76 and 81 of 6 March, 68 of 12 March, 157 of 26 March, 115 of 16 April, 73 of 29 May 2019 and 119 of 25 June 2019, and in the Information Note attached to this response.</p><p>A characteristic of the Irish roster has been the broad base of expertise which Irish volunteers have brought in its different iterations since it was first established.  Each new mustering is an opportunity to refresh the roster, and to extend the opportunity to volunteer to a range of new potential observers of differing backgrounds.  Election observers who have been elected to national office bring unique perspectives into observation missions, which can enhance their quality and credibility.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Vote 27<br /><br />International Cooperation Budget<br /><br />(in &euro; million)</th><th>Election Observation Budget<br /><br />(in &euro; million)</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>497.08</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>479.16</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>476.62</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>486.43</td><td>0.18</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>486.61</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>500.13</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>544.93</td><td>0.18</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is further compelling evidence of the urgent need to get the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland in place again. Budgetary and other decisions in relation to the delivery of public services and the full range of devolved policy issues need to be made by the power-sharing Executive and Assembly, elected by and accountable to all of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  While the specifics of a budget for Northern Ireland are not for the Government to engage on, I have had extensive discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the difficulties raised by the continuing absence of the devolved institutions and on how both Governments can continue to work together and do everything possible to secure an agreement that will get all institutions of the Agreement working again.</p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively with that objective in the talks at Stormont over the last number of weeks. Progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue between the party leaders. The two largest parties have a particular responsibility to reach an accommodation to secure the formation of a new power-sharing Executive.</p>  <p>  The two Governments have called on the parties to continue to participate in this dialogue with each other towards a sustainable accommodation for all. The Governments and the leads of the Working Groups will also continue to engage with all the parties in discussions on the outstanding issues. The Governments will have to make an assessment before long on whether it is possible to move quickly in this period to final agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p></reply>

In advance of the fourth and most recent session in October 2018, Ecuador circulated the zero draft of a legally binding instrument.  The next session of the Group will take place in October 2019 and Ireland will work with our EU partners to look at how we might actively and constructively engage in the negotiation process, notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which the work of the Group has been conducted to date.  While we are open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty, we believe that all economic operators should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. The draft treaty that has currently been circulated focuses on transnational corporations and it is Ireland's view that any new treaty should cover both companies engaged in purely domestic operations as well as transnational corporations.</p>  <p>  We would wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point, I would note that of the 21 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost &euro;65m in each of 2016 and 2017, rising to &euro;70m in 2018. This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>I understand and fully sympathise with any person who suffers from a serious physical disability and can&rsquo;t access the scheme under the current criteria. However, given the scope and scale of the scheme, any possible changes to it can only be made after careful consideration, taking into account the existing and prospective cost of the scheme as well as the availability of other schemes which seek to help with the mobility of disabled persons, and the interaction between each of these schemes.  </p><p>Accordingly, I have no plans to amend the qualifying medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme at this time. </p><p>Finally, I would like to point out that legislation is being brought forward by the Minister for Health to replace the closed Motorised Transport Grant. </p></reply>

In the absence of discretionary policy intervention, the fixed level of welfare payments, for example, means that the welfare system stimulates aggregate demand within the economy relatively more during a downturn than during a period of expansion. This effect is what is known as an &lsquo;automatic stabiliser&rsquo;, where the tax or welfare system effectively &lsquo;leans against the wind&rsquo; in a counter-cyclical manner. In this regard, it is worth noting that linking welfare payments to wage developments in the economy could represent a pro-cyclical policy action, serving to reduce the operation of automatic stabilisers. This is because the level of payments would rise in line with income increases, i.e. in an upturn, and decrease as incomes fall, i.e. in a downturn.  </p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that, as Minister for Finance, I continue to have the discretion to respond to cyclical changes in the economy.  A commitment to wage indexation of this nature would significantly curtail this discretion, as it would absorb substantial budgetary resources. In fact, the ESRI has examined the impact of indexing both the tax and welfare system to wage inflation, with a recently published report estimating that this would cost the Exchequer some &euro;1.2 billion annually.</p>  <p>  For these reasons, whilst the Roadmap for Pensions Reform includes a commitment specifically in relation to the indexation of State Pension payments, indexation is not being considered as an across the board measure to support the operation of automatic stabilisers.</p></reply>

Each lender will also have its own individual credit lending policies and lenders will also make their lending decisions in the context of such policies.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-07-10a.231.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019071000084#WRF01600"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I  nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided either to consumers or businesses. </p><p>However, I acknowledge the general problems faced by many consumers, businesses, community and voluntary groups, in relation to the cost and availability of insurance.  I also appreciate that there is some frustration about the perceived pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance. </p><p>However, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government.  The Deputy will be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses, including hoteliers.  As part of this exercise, there has been extensive interaction with interested stakeholders, including the body mentioned in the details supplied, and the insurance industry and its representative bodies.</p><p>The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017 and makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  In January 2018, the Working Group also published the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  This Report makes a further 15 Recommendations with 29 associated actions.  There has been significant work to date in implementing the recommendations of the two reports, including the following:</p><p>- the progression of the Judicial Council Bill in order to implement recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission regarding award levels in this country, including a judicial recalibration of the existing Book of Quantum guidelines;</p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance;</p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;</p><p>- commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,</p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses. </p><p>With regard to the urgency of setting up the Judicial Council, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has worked closely with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD to progress the Judicial Council Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas as a matter of priority.  I am therefore pleased that the Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 July, and I expect it will be signed into law by the President shortly. Now that the Bill has been passed, it will be a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to establish the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly by targeting an end of year completion date for an initial set of guidelines, which take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report.</p><p>With regard to a zero tolerance approach to fraud, I believe that one of the key achievements of the CIWG is increased coordination and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry with regard to tackling fraud.  This includes the reporting of suspected fraud, as well as to how that fraud is recorded on the PULSE system.  In addition, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has decided for operational reasons to investigate insurance fraud at the divisional level, rather than establish a centralised insurance investigation unit, which may not be in a position to investigate incidents at a local level to the same extent.  I understand that this approach is aligned with a general divisional-focused Garda model and that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.  I believe it is important to accept the expert view of the Garda Commissioner in this matter and I understand that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided further detail on their approach at the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 9 July.  I am confident that this marks a key turning point in how insurance fraud will be investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the future.  There has also been recent success under <i>Operation Coatee</i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.</p><p>With regard to the final point made, there have neem a number of measures already introduced that will improve the Irish claims process, such as reform to PI AB, as well as the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Courts and Civil Liability Act 2004.  I believe that a key potential outcome of the recalibration of award levels through Judicial Council Guidelines is that there should be lower and more consistent award levels given.  If consistency of awards can be applied in a broad sense, particularly for soft tissue injuries, it should have two very significant effects.  The first is that there should be less reason for cases to go to litigation, as the level of awards granted by the courts will be aligned with those provided by PIAB; this in turn should mean a reduction in legal costs; and secondly, a stable claims and awards environment should mean that the reserves put aside by insurers to meet future claims would not have to be regularly adjusted to reflect new developments, such as increases in award levels.</p><p>In conclusion, I believe that the level and consistency of awards form a vital part element of our efforts to address the personal injuries claim process and the cost and availability of insurance.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.

It had been reduced to the flat 2 per cent rate in Budget 2012 (with effect from December 2011).</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that net receipts of Stamp Duty associated with all types of property for 2018 amounted to approximately &euro;660 million, compared to a target of &euro;785 million. It is tentatively estimated that around &euro;488 million of these receipts related to non-residential property.</p>  <p>  While a monthly profile covering Stamp Duty on non-residential property only isn&rsquo;t prepared, for the full year 2019 receipts are forecast to be &euro;565 million. The forecast for all property (residential and non-residential) is &euro;750 million.</p>  <p>  While the 2018 receipts of &euro;660 million do represent a 16% or &euro;124 million shortfall against target, it should also be noted that they represent a &euro;279 million or 73% increase on the 2017 figures. </p>  <p>  Based on the information available, it is estimated that the shortfall against target is attributable to a combination of reduced activity in other property categories, as well as a lower than expected yield on the residential side due to the prevalence of the forward purchasing model.</p>  <p>  The use of taxation policy instruments have long been recognised as a potential tool to discourage speculative investment in property markets. For example, in the July 2016 IMF Staff paper on Ireland, reference was made to the use of property taxes (either based on capital or market value, or annual rental value) and cyclical transactions taxes as tools that could help dampen the boom phase of a real estate cycle as well as discouraging speculative activity. </p>  <p>  The low 2 per cent flat rate that applied to non-residential property transactions for almost 7 years prior to the Budget 2018 increase was introduced at a time when activity levels were very low. It can be viewed as a departure from the much higher rates that had applied over the preceding fourteen years and was justified by the exceptionally difficult market situation and lack of commercial output that applied at the time of its introduction. </p>  <p>  With the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) market performing strongly, the disjoint between available yields and overall viability considerations between the residential and commercial sectors, and given the policy desirability of re-balancing construction activity towards residential investment and avoiding overheating in the construction sector, it was appropriate to increase the rate of stamp duty applying to non-residential property to 6 per cent in Budget 2018.</p>  <p>  The increase of the non-residential stamp duty rate in Budget 2018 has contributed to a dampening of any potential for overheating in the commercial element of the construction sector and has encouraged a greater focus on increased home building. The measure has therefore contributed to the ongoing balancing and stabilisation of the Irish property market, which has seen an increase in construction in the residential sector and a moderation in price increases in the sector.</p></reply>

Where share options are exercised, and the shares subsequently sold, the taxpayers involved will be subject to Capital Gains Tax on the disposal.

In particular, Article 4 relates to a &lsquo;common budgetary timeline&rsquo; and requires that &ldquo;the draft budget for the forthcoming year for the central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all the other subsectors of the general government shall be made public annually not later than 15 October&rdquo;. </p>  <p>As a European Regulation, the legislation became directly effective in Ireland from the date of it's adoption, on 21 May 2013. Thus, the legal requirement under both Irish and EU law that requires us to publish our budget by 15th October every year has it's basis in the same European Regulation. There are no legal grounds, however, to delay the announcement of the annual budget beyond the 15 October. </p>  <p>In terms of the specific enactment of the actual budgetary measures, Article 4 of the above mentioned Regulation further provides that the &ldquo;budget for the central government shall be adopted or fixed upon and made public annually not later than 31 December&rdquo;. </p>  <p>In line with the requirements of the Regulation, last month the Government agreed that Budget 2020 will take place on Tuesday 8 October 2019. This allows for the budgetary measures to be presented and debated in the Oireachtas, in advance of the formal transmission to the European Commission of the Draft Budgetary Plan, by 15 October 2019. </p></reply>

It adopts a prudent approach to the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding requirement which gives it confidence that it can meet the Exchequer&rsquo;s funding needs, irrespective of the risks &ndash; such as Brexit &ndash; that might emerge.</p>  <p>  The NTMA issued &euro;10.4 billion of benchmark bonds in the first half of the year. This means that almost 75% of the minimum of the &euro;14-&euro;18 billion 2019 bond funding range has already been completed. This issuance had a weighted average yield of just below 1.2% and a weighted average maturity of 18.5 years. There is a bond auction of &euro;1 billion scheduled for tomorrow, 11 July and a further auction planned for September. The NTMA also raised &euro;0.3 billion earlier this year through the issue of an inflation linked bond, bringing total medium and long-term issuance so far this year to close to &euro;11 billion.  </p>  <p>  Over the next 15 months there are three Government bond maturities totalling &euro;23 billion. Over that same period five tranches of the UK bilateral loan will mature. This brings total medium and long-term debt maturities to over &euro;25 billion in that time.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that increased activity in short-term markets means that over half of the current cash balance is funded from short-term debt; some of which will be repaid before year-end. </p>  <p>  The NTMA has already repaid one bond this year &ndash; &euro;7.1 billion in June &ndash; and there is a second bond maturity of &euro;6 billion in October. The first tranche of the UK bilateral loan matured in April and two more tranches will mature before year-end; one this month and one in September. Each maturity amounts to &pound;0.4 billion. </p>  <p>  The cost of holding cash balances has been mitigated by the favourable interest rate environment which has allowed the NTMA to issue short-term debt at negative interest rates. The estimated cost of the portion of the cash funded from medium to long-term bond issuance is approximately &euro;1 million per month per &euro;1 billion of borrowing.   </p>  <p>  The NTMA have advised me that the cash balances will decline in the coming months such that it expects to hold approximately &euro;13 billion at year-end.</p></reply>

Where there is no Corporation Tax liability in a given year, a company may claim to have the credit paid to them in 3 instalments over a period of 33 months. The following table shows the number of companies and the average refund amount. Due to Revenue&rsquo;s obligation to observe confidentiality for taxpayer information, it is not possible to show the highest refund. <table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of Companies </th><th>Average Refund <br /><br />&euro; </th></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>1,067 </td><td>127,900 </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>1,092 </td><td>215,650 </td></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>1,067 </td><td>305,400 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>1,027 </td><td>349,450 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>1,025 </td><td>230,480 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>1,025 </td><td>147,800 </td></tr></table>Regarding Questions 30307/19 and 30308/19, it is not possible to accurately estimate the savings if the R&amp;amp;D tax credit was no longer payable, which would require an estimate of the outstanding liability to the State from refundable payable research and development credits, as information in respect of either the outstanding current liability or future expenditure is not available from tax returns. However, on the basis of claims from the 2017 tax returns, it is tentatively estimated that the full year gain from abolishing the refundable credits aspect of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit could be in the region of &euro;150m.</p><p>Regarding Question 30309/19, information in respect of relief for key employees engaged in research and development activities is available on the tax returns for the years 2013 to 2017. Tax returns for later years are not yet available. The number of individuals claiming the relief for the years 2013, 2015 and 2017 was less than 10 in each of these years, with a cost in each year of less than &euro;0.05 million. For 2014 there were 25 individuals with an average claim of &euro;2,721. For 2016 there were 11 individuals with average claim of &euro;4,438 The highest claim cannot be provided due to Revenue&rsquo;s need to protect taxpayer confidentiality.  </p><p>Finally regarding question 30311/19, I am advised by Revenue that companies currently claim the R&amp;amp;D tax credit when making their self-assessed tax return. Accordingly, there is no need for them to provide supporting documentation at the point of claim.</p><p>Revenue carries out a programme of targeted risk driven compliance interventions on self-assessment tax returns. Claims for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit fall within the scope and is one area of focus for this programme. Revenue is of the view that this is the most effective way for them to ensure that only valid claims for the research and development credit qualify as repayable tax credits.</p></reply>

The first quarter returns yielded &euro;22 million and it is estimated that &euro;11 million of this amount arose from the increase in the rate to 2%. The second quarterly returns for 2019 covering the period April to June are due later this month.</p>  <p>  Overall, Betting Tax is expected to yield &euro;91 million in 2019 (which incorporates returns made in respect of the fourth quarter of 2018, based on the 1% rate), an increase of &euro;39 million compared to the &euro;52 million collected in 2018. Most of the forecasted increase is due to the change in the rate.</p>  <p>  Betting duty receipts go to the Central Fund.  Section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provided that the Horse and Greyhound Fund would each year be financed by an amount equal to the revenue from excise duty on off-course betting in the preceding year or the year 2000 funding levels increased by reference to the Consumer Price Index, whichever was greater. This formula applied for the years 2001-2008. However since 2009, the level by which the Fund is to be increased has been decided by the Minister for Agriculture in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that a breakdown is not collected from Bookmakers of the events on which bets are placed for the purposes of Betting Duty.  Betting Duty is applied based on a rate of 2% of the value of any bet entered into with a bookmaker.  It is not necessary for Revenue to collect information on the underlying events linked to bets which are liable to Betting Duty.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to amend legislation for the purposes of collecting information on the events giving rise to bets which are liable to Betting Duty.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that companies will make use of the 24 month time frame available.  Therefore more claims in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 may be made by September 2019.</p>  <p>  No data in respect of 2018 will be available until the Corporation Tax returns for the accounting years ended in 2018 are filed and analysed. Likewise, data on later years are not currently available.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that, due to the small number of KDB claims and Revenue&rsquo;s obligation to protect the confidentiality of taxpayer data, it is not possible to provide further information on claimants.</p>  <p>  As the KDB was introduced for accounting periods ending on or after 1 January 2016 it has not been subject to an ex post evaluation yet.  The KDB has a sunset clause of 31 December 2020, therefore an ex post evaluation of the relief will occur prior to Budget 2021.

This fixed amount is apportioned between the banks on the basis of the amount of deposit interest retention tax (DIRT) paid by a particular bank in a specified year (the base year).  The amount of the levy paid by a particular bank must therefore change whenever the base year changes.  A change in the base year necessitates a change in the rate of the levy to ensure that the overall fixed amount of the yield is maintained.</p>  <p>  The levy is currently charged at the rate of 59% of the DIRT paid in the 2015 base year, the base year for the years 2017 and 2018.  The year 2017 is the base year for the years 2019 and 2020.  In 2017 approximately &euro;88 million DIRT was paid which was significantly lower than the amount paid in 2015.  If left unchanged, the current rate of 59% would yield only &euro;52 million when the levy for 2019 is due to be paid on 20 October 2019.  The doubling of the current rate to 118% would yield approximately &euro;104 million. The rate required to maintain the &euro;150 million yield for the years 2019 and 2020 is 170%.</p>  <p>  I announced in May that, to ensure that the &euro;150 million yield is maintained, I intend to bring forward a Financial Resolution on Budget night 2019 increasing the rate of the levy to 170% to be charged on DIRT payments made in 2017. This will be subject to the enactment of Finance Bill 2019.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that, under section 851A Taxes Consolidation Act 1999, confidential taxpayer information may only be disclosed by Revenue in certain specified circumstances. These circumstances do not include the details of DIRT payments made by the banks who are subject to the bank levy. I cannot therefore provide details of the amount of the levy that currently applies, or that will apply, to individual banks.</p></reply>

However, a Revenue concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils. Because of difficulties in interpretation, the Revenue Commissioners decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate. However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process, that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper, to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently concluded the public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including health and nutrition experts as well as my colleague the Minister for Health, to ensure that any legislative changes brought forward are evidence based. Officials in my department reviewed the submissions received and this review was presented to a meeting of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) on 9th July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly.</p>  <p>  With regard to Parliamentary Question No. 42 of 3 December 2014, and the two supplements specified in the Question, probiotics and glucosamine, the case remains that there is insufficient information provided to make a determination. If the Deputy could provide more information on the food supplements in question, the Revenue Commissioners can advise on their correct VAT treatment as appropriate.</p>  <p>  It should also, however, be noted that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  I have recently relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ an additional School Secretaries up to a maximum of two per school.  There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department.  This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  </p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs.  Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers.  For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department recently had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting.  F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019.  The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim.  This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  The Department is fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once this work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

Once the location has been determined, the project to deliver the school accommodation can advance into the architectural planning process.</p><p>A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies.</p><p>The patronage process for primary and post-primary schools to be established in 2020 will commence later this year, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website () and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie).</p><p>Once the patronage of the new school has been announced, the process to appoint a principal for the school can commence.  My Department allows for appointments of Principals to all new schools from 1 September of the school year prior to the opening of a new school.  The recruitment and appointment of teachers, including Principals, to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012).</p></reply>

Prospective applicants on higher incomes may not have applied for support as their income was above the relevant threshold.  As such, it is not possible to accurately cost the number of additional students who may qualify for support, if the thresholds are increased. </p>  <p>  Allowing for the limitations regarding the accuracy of the costings, it is estimated that a 5% increase in the income thresholds would cost in the region of &euro;10m and a 10% increase would cost in the region of &euro;20m.  The cost of increasing the threshold by 20% is more difficult to estimate given the potentially large number of students who may benefit but who have not previously applied to SUSI for support.  It is therefore estimated that a 20% increase could cost in the region of &euro;50m.</p>  <p>  The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments nor do they include any changes to the post-graduate income thresholds.</p></reply>

In Budget 2019, school leadership is again supported with an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes. These additional release days - 18, 24, and 30 depending on the size of the school - will be effective from 1st September 2019.  </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets, including &euro;0.4 million made available in Budget 2018 to fund almost 4,600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Enabling teaching principals to have one release day per week would cost an estimated &euro;7.5m per annum. </p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will have to be considered as part of the annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands in the education sector.</p></reply>

There are currently a total of 189 primary schools with either a school secretary or caretaker employed under this 1978/79 scheme. This is further broken down to 150 schools employing only a school secretary and 39 schools only employing a caretaker.</p>  <p>  Currently there are 153 primary and 110 post primary whole time equivalent Clerical Officers (School Secretaries) employed in schools under the 1978/79 Scheme and paid through my Department&rsquo;s payroll. There are also 86 whole time equivalent primary school caretakers employed under the 1978/79 Scheme and paid through my Department&rsquo;s payroll.</p>  <p>  This 1978/79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive capitation grant Scheme. The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.</p>  <p>  Within the ancillary services grant programme, the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply their own arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit.  My Department does not have any direct role in the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  Given that employment of school secretaries and caretakers is dealt with at local school level, my Department does not have a central record of the number of school secretaries and caretakers funded by the ancillary services grant.</p>  <p>  On a related matter the Deputy may be interested to know that today my Department announced an online survey for schools to complete regarding secretaries and caretakers employed by them and paid by grant funding.  These surveys are being undertaken in response to a pay claim that has recently been tabled by the F&Oacute;RSA union. </p>  <p>  The surveys will issue to over 3,500 individual schools. Given the scale of the task and the fact that schools are in the summer holiday period, my Department expects to have analysis from the surveys available in early October.</p>  <p>  The closing date is Wednesday 4 September and my Department is encouraging all relevant schools to complete the surveys before that date.  </p></reply>

It is not intended to cover the full cost of attending college. The student grant scheme does, however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres. </p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years. Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  The first year cost of "decreasing the non-adjacent rate of third-level grants from 45km to 24km" is estimated to be in the region of &euro;11.5m.

Very significant capital investment is also being made, amounting to &euro; 92 million this year. </p>  <p>  In terms of the estate, the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by significant Exchequer funding across the Garda and OPW Votes.  Other major ongoing works to the Garda estate include the pilot Garda station reopening project, the development of a new facility at Military Road and the major refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street station. The goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff, as well as the public interacting with them. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations. Indeed the Deputy may recall that as recently as December 2018, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in its report &ldquo;Policing with Local Communities&rdquo; confirmed that it is appropriate that the Commissioner should continue to hold this responsibility.  And the Office of Public Works (OPW) has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and as such, cooperates closely with the Garda authorities in delivery of Garda accommodation and works to the Garda estate.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Building and Refurbishment Programme, which is based on agreed Garda priorities, does not include plans for the development of a new Garda station at Citywest.</p>  <p>  Overall Garda accommodation needs, including any potential need for a new station at any location, fall to be considered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the ongoing expansion of the Garda workforce and implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p></reply>

Following this, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Central Statistics Office signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 10<sup>th</sup>January 2019 regarding the undertaking of the survey.</p><p>The CSO have now begun the work on the large scale survey, called the Sexual Violence Survey (SVS), which will look in detail at the experience of sexual violence and abuse for both women and men in Ireland, with repeat surveys every decade.</p><p>This is a large and complex survey. The Government&rsquo;s expert Scoping Group report made clear that delivering a survey that met the highest standards would be a significant undertaking and a multi-annual project.</p><p>A priority of mine is that it be done right.  We want to ensure that the State undertakes an ongoing programme of research of the highest quality in a sensitive and ethical way to ensure a robust set of data to inform Government policy.  The complexities and timeframes involved have been acknowledged by some of the NGOs involved in the sector.</p><p>  The CSO has provided an estimated timeline of up to five years for completion including a full first year of technical research, design, specialist training and preparation. The preparatory phase will also involve a stakeholder consultation process, consideration of best international practice and the conducting of a full pilot survey in the field in 2020.</p><p>As has been stated, a national survey by its nature cannot achieve data to make useful or meaningful conclusions on the experiences of sexual violence for smaller cohorts such as members of vulnerable and minority groups. The report of the Scoping Group did indeed recommend that further consideration be given to the development of appropriate supplementary data collection exercises to explore the experiences of those harder to reach groups. Following the pilot of the SVS, proposals will be developed to explore options, including conducting qualitative work on such sub populations.</p><p>The provision of reliable, robust, objective and internationally comparable information requires that the planning and execution of this survey is undertaken in a professional and comprehensive manner and to do otherwise may compromise the quality of the resulting data. Therefore, the planned duration of the new Sexual Violence Survey (SVS) is to ensure that all aspects of the survey are undertaken and completed to the highest possible standard.</p></reply>

The Government has committed in the National Strategy for Women and Girls to considering gender impact in the development of new strategies and the review of existing strategies. It will also require all public bodies to assess and identify the human rights of women and girls and the gender equality issues that are relevant to their functions and address these in their strategic planning, policies and practices, and annual reports, in line with the public sector duty under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.</p><p>The Domestic Violence Act 2018 was a key action in progressing the ratification of the Istanbul Convention as it delivered on a number of Convention requirements including extending access to barring orders, giving judges powers to refer perpetrators to programmes and providing for an offence of forced marriage. </p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department has agreed a policy and practice document on safeguarding RIA residents against domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and harassment. This policy was agreed in April 2014 between RIA, Cosc and NGOs such as AkiDwA, Ruhama and the UNHCR and appropriate training was provided to all accommodation centre staff. The policy can be found on the RIA webpage: </p><p>The Istanbul Convention refers to parties taking the necessary legislative or other measures to develop gender-sensitive reception procedures and support services for asylum-seekers as well as gender guidelines and gender-sensitive asylum procedures, including refugee status determination and application for international protection. New national standards for RIA accommodation centres have been developed by my Department in conjunction with NGOs, residents of accommodation centres and other Government Departments. These standards, which are due to be published shortly, will support the process of ensuring that reception procedures and support services for asylum seekers are appropriately gender sensitive.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the average length of stay in Direct Provision accommodation has reduced from 32 months in 2015 to 24 months at the end of 2018 and significant efforts are being made by my officials to further reduce this period.</p><p>More generally, as you are aware, the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the offer of accommodation and supports to persons seeking international protection in Ireland.  Applicants are free to accept these services or are free to source their own accommodation with family or friends. While previously this was done on an administrative basis, this is now carried out under the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive, which was transposed into Irish law in June 2018 by way of SI No. 230 of 2018.</p><p>My Department working together with other Departments and agencies has already introduced far-reaching and important reforms to the overall system and this process will continue as we strive to make further improvements in the future.  One of the most significant improvements is the introduction of independent living, which allows applicants to obtain food and other products in a specially-constructed food hall in the centre and to cook the food at either communal or individual cooking stations.</p><p>As of early April 2019, over 2,200 applicants across eight centres were availing of the independent living model.  In addition, almost 1,400 other applicants have access to other self-catering facilities with food provided by the contractor or the applicant themselves.  The Department of Justice and Equality anticipates that all of the centres under contract to it will have moved to the independent living model by mid-2020. </p><p>In addition, there have been significant improvements to recreation opportunities, such as the provision of outdoor sports pitches, including &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities, teenagers' rooms and family living rooms in centres to provide social areas for particular age groups.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre. </p><p>The following figures include over 700 people with a protection status or a permission to remain in the State.  </p><p>Residents who have been granted status or a permission to remain have the same access to housing supports and services as Irish and EEA nationals.  Considerable work is being undertaken to support these residents to move out of accommodation centres and into secure permanent accommodation.  RIA have a specific team who work on this.  Their work is enhanced through the funded transitional support work provided by DePaul Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust. A number of NGOs has also been awarded monies under the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF).  These include the PATHS project and South Dublin County Partnership. </p><p>Additionally, RIA is liaising with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and the City and County Managers Association collectively to support residents with permission to remain to access housing options.</p><p><b>Duration of Stay of RIA Residents at July 9th 2019</b><table><tr><th><b>By Months</b></th><th><b>No. of RIA Applicants</b></th></tr><tr><td>0&amp;lt;3</td><td>857</td></tr><tr><td>3&amp;lt;6</td><td>652</td></tr><tr><td>6&amp;lt;9</td><td>681</td></tr><tr><td>9&amp;lt;12</td><td>641</td></tr><tr><td>12&amp;lt;18</td><td>822</td></tr><tr><td>18&amp;lt;24</td><td>761</td></tr><tr><td>24&amp;lt;36</td><td>924</td></tr><tr><td>36&amp;lt;48</td><td>857</td></tr><tr><td>48&amp;lt;60</td><td>435</td></tr><tr><td>60&amp;lt;72</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>72&amp;lt;84</td><td>63</td></tr><tr><td>84+</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6961</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In May 2018, following a comprehensive review of the data and evidence available, and consideration of a detailed business case by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as the lead policy Department for the sector, a pilot quota based scheme was introduced to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  The quotas introduced were 500, 1,500 and 50 respectively.  The scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities.  </p>  <p>  The application of a quota based system is to ensure that in the longer-term, strategies are put in place to source labour supply from both the domestic and European labour markets and to invest in innovative technologies for the sector. To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful with the number of permits issued in the dairy sector almost exhausted. </p>  <p>  These lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review process involving consideration of research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  Submissions to the review process are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by my Department which includes the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  The pilot scheme provides that additional employment permit quotas may be granted in response to progress reported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on commitments given by the sector to:</p>  <p>  - the systematic and  structured engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regarding sourcing labour from the live register and across the EEA;</p>  <p>  - the development of training, upskilling and career opportunities;</p>  <p>  - a commitment to examine the potential of innovation in the sector to ameliorate reliance on a model of  low skill, low wage employment.  </p>  <p>  The views of the lead policy Government Department for the sector, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are an important part of the decision-making process.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the business case submitted by the sector requesting an extension to this quota has been forwarded to my Department, following its consideration by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. My Officials are currently examining the submission as a matter of urgency and I expect to be in a position to make a decision on this request very shortly.</p></reply>

Through my Department and its Enterprise Agencies, I am focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country.  In 2018, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA Ireland were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history.  The strength of the IDA's recent mid-year results for 2019 indicates that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in the regions so attractive in the first place with the technology, financial services and pharmaceutical sectors performing extremely well. </p><p>Kildare and Wicklow are part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s East &amp;amp; Mid -East region. There are 29 IDA supported client companies in County Kildare, which collectively employ 8,838 people - representing an increase of 4.5% over the previous year. IDA clients such as Intel, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble are all located in Kildare and continue to perform well. FDI levels in Wicklow are also trending in the right direction. The County saw a 17% increase in FDI employment last year, with 388 net new jobs added by IDA client companies. </p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s South-East region includes Counties Kilkenny, Waterford and Carlow. There are currently five IDA client companies located in Kilkenny employing a total of 711 people which represents an 8% increase since 2015.  County Waterford has 38 IDA client companies employing approximately 7,100 people, representing an increase of 3% over last year with 374 net new jobs added. There are currently seven IDA client companies operating in Co. Carlow employing a total of 1,150 people. Last year alone, the number of IDA supported jobs in Carlow increased by 31% with 275 net new jobs added. A further boost to the County was MSD's announcement late last year that it plans to construct a second manufacturing facility at its existing site in Carlow with the creation of 170 new jobs. </p><p>County Galway is part of the IDA&rsquo;s West region and is home to a strong base of multinational companies.  There are 81 IDA clients in the County employing 19,969 people, which represents an increase of almost 8% over last year. Galway has developed into a focused global centre of FDI activity providing knowledge intensive services for global companies such as Boston Scientific, Medtronic, HP and CISCO.</p><p>Table (A) outlines the employment figures for the years 2015-2018. Figures for 2019 will not be available until the end of the year.  Data on IDA-supported jobs is collated on a county-by-county basis. Information on the number of jobs in specific towns and locations is therefore unfortunately unavailable. Table (B) outlines site visits to the respective counties from 2015 to Q1 2019. Whilst site visits are an important tool in helping showcase regional locations to investors, it is important to remember that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant proportion of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country.  Investments by IDA clients are released as national figures only and Table (C) outlines the number of these investments won from 2014 to 2018.  <b></b></p><p><b>Table (A) IDA Employment 2015-2018</b><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>2015</div></th><th><div>2016</div></th><th><div>2017</div></th><th><div>2018</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>768</td><td>802</td><td>875</td><td>1,150</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>15,463</td><td>17,041</td><td>18,503</td><td>19,969</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>650</td><td>762</td><td>716</td><td>711</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5,574</td><td>6,253</td><td>6,690</td><td>7,064</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2,203</td><td>2,234</td><td>2,230</td><td>2,618</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>10,123</td><td>9,740</td><td>8,452</td><td>8,838</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table (B) IDA Site Visits 2015 to Q1 2019</b><table><tr><th><div>County</div></th><th><div>2015</div></th><th><div>2016</div></th><th><div>2017</div></th><th><div>2018</div></th><th><div>Q1 2019</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>41</td><td>42</td><td>62</td><td>54</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>31</td><td>17</td><td>11</td><td>21</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>3</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table (C) IDA Ireland Annual Total Investments 2014 - 2018 </b><table><tr><th><div>Year</div></th><th><div>Total Number of Investments</div></th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>197</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>244</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>265</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As a result clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. There are assessments and tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner. Specialised tests may be required when considering and ruling out other diagnoses.</p>  <p>  Treatment for ME is tailored to address the varying symptoms presented by those affected by ME. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. Different patients, depending on their primary symptoms, will require different Consultant input. The challenge in relation to ME is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients frequently attending different Consultants for management of their symptoms as and when they arise. Consultants are well used to coordinating the care of patients that require the input of their colleagues and other members of the multidisciplinary care team. </p>  <p>  Waiting times for access to these services can be lengthy. However, there is currently work under way as part of the implementation of the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020, specifically as regards addressing how and where the patient is treated and the classification of referrals with corresponding clinically recommended time-frames. Consideration is also being given to condition specific referral forms. This work should see significant improvements with respect to access to appropriate services.</p>  <p>  As these questions relates to service matters, I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply. </p></reply>

The costs of this are shared across the tenant Departments.

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 Community Healthcare Organisations (CHOs) and 6 Hospital Groups are in place on an administrative basis to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively. While significant progress has been made by these structures, there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service underpinned by population based planning, as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p><p>  In this regard, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommended that &ldquo;further analysis and consultation should be undertaken to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.</p><p>  As a first step in this process, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018. In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs, CHNs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional health bodies. My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring these proposals to Government shortly, together with the findings of the public consultation, which I expect to be published shortly thereafter.</p><p>In parallel, work is progressing in my Department on the development of detailed policy proposals on reconfiguration of the HSE, including the establishment of regional health bodies. This will take into account international experience of regional delivery of healthcare along with a comprehensive engagement process with stakeholders in the Irish health system.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  As Minister for Health, I have no role or powers in relation to such matters. </p><p>Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, including advice from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The HSE has a robust assessment and commercial negotiation process for new medicines. This process challenges inappropriate costings from applicant companies and delivers improved value for money on new medicines, allowing more treatments to be provided within a finite budget. </p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments can be ongoing multi-million euro investments. </p><p>I am advised by the HSE that it has assessed osimertinib for the following indication:</p><p>-The treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC.  </p><p>In respect of this indication, the NCPE completed its Health Technology Assessment (HTA) in May 2018. Following the assessment and after a number of rounds of commercial negotiations and HSE reviews, the HSE notified the applicant in February 2019 that it was minded to not approve osimertinib for the 2<sup>nd</sup>line treatment of EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancers. </p><p>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 requires a period of representations after such notifications, before the HSE makes any formal final decision. The HSE reviewed representations received at its May 2019 meeting and they are currently under consideration .</p><p>In addition, the HSE have commissioned a HTA on osimertinib for:</p><p>-the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. </p><p>I am informed that this assessment is ongoing and will be assessed in line with the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

The Scoping Inquiry submitted its Final Report in September 2018 and a Supplementary Report this June, and provided welcome assurance in relation to the quality management processes in the labs. Dr Scally has said he has found no evidence of deficiencies in screening quality in any of the labs. These are very welcome reassurances for women in Ireland, given the importance of screening for women&rsquo;s health and the need for external laboratory capacity to support the programme. </p>  <p>  At the same time, Dr Scally did as we know uncover significant issues across a range of areas within screening, and made 58 recommendations in total across his reports. My focus now is on the full implementation of all of those recommendations, which are fundamental to strengthening the programme and ensuring it delivers a service of the highest quality for Irish women. </p>  <p>  I take it that, in referring to an integrated service, the Deputy is referring particularly to the laboratory element of the screening pathway which is currently provided primarily by external providers, with a small element provided by the Coombe Hospital. While Dr Scally made no recommendation regarding how laboratory services should be provided, the HSE has advised it is committed to the further development of laboratory services at the Coombe, and that work is ongoing in relation to development of costings and a business case, taking account of future need. </p></reply>

The risks identified relate to safety, fire safety management, layout, size, age, fixtures, fittings and lighting. Environmental risks were identified in relation to safe evacuation of patients. Elms Ward was found to have significant risk to patients and staff due to its uneven floor.</p>  <p>  To comply with legislative requirements, and in the best interests of patients and staff, the HSE needs to close the ward on a phased basis with effect from 1st July 2019, to be completed by August. This decision was based solely on health and safety concerns, and not as a cost saving measure.  There will be some reduction in access to transitional care beds from acute settings, however, all patients will remain in the Hospital until their current care is completed. The Department has been assured that all commitments for booked respite care will be honoured and plans are being put in place to that effect. </p>  <p>  Staff were advised of this decision through consultation with their line management and they will be reassigned within the Hospital. The HSE has advised the Department that significant capital is required to address the health and safety issues and part of the project development process will be to examine all options available to provide safe services.</p>  <p>  The primary focus must be on patients.  Engagement with them, their families, staff, union representatives and any other relevant stakeholders is on-going to ensure minimal impact for all concerned during the closure of the ward.</p></reply>

It advised that the HSE is developing terms of reference for a Medical Workforce and Patient Safety Oversight Group supported by a project team to agree and oversee implementation of actions in relation to the following priority areas:</p><p>- Doctors employed by the HSE who are not on the Specialist Register,</p><p>- Non-Training Scheme NCHDs</p><p>- The recruitment process for NCHDs</p><p>- The recruitment process for consultants</p><p>- Retention of consultants and NCHDs, and</p><p>- The configuration of services that will best support the recruitment and retention of consultants and NCHDs , facilitate their training requirements and other needs.  </p><p>The correspondence included a number of appendices, one of which was the Report of the NDTP Project Team on the Employment of Consultants Not Registered in the Specialist Division of the Register of Medical Practitioners. The Report highlights the work in train to address the position of those appointed to posts though not on the specialist register and the supervisory arrangements that are to be followed in such cases. It also addresses the issue of supporting such consultants to achieve specialist registration.

Over time, the vision is that everyone will have entitlement to a comprehensive range of primary, acute and social care services at no cost or at a substantially reduced cost and that the vast majority of this care will be provided in primary and community settings. </p>  <p>  Within the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy, Strategic Action 6 aims to expand eligibility on a phased basis to move towards universal healthcare and support a shift to community-based care.  The vision is that all citizens will have universal access to healthcare, in both the acute and community settings.  In order to achieve this goal, there will need to be an expansion in eligibility, particularly for primary and community care.  Although there is wide-ranging agreement that Ireland should move in the direction of a universal single-tier health service, there is also widespread acknowledgement that this goal presents a number of challenges. </p>  <p>  As detailed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan for 2019, the department is currently reviewing the basis for existing hospital and medication charges and it is anticipated that the review will be finalised shortly. By the end of 2019, the Department will seek to develop options for future changes to hospital and medication charges and develop policy options for achieving universal eligibility.</p></reply>

The contribution from the agriculture sector to this national ambition is significant.</p><p>However, agriculture cannot stand in isolation on this matter and will continue to work with all stakeholders including the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment to continue to examine and deliver the best means of encouraging sustainable food production, while optimising the sectors contribution to greenhouse gas mitigation, sequestration and displacement of fossil fuels.  The targets set in this climate action plan for the sector are ambitious and challenging and will require early and extensive adoption of mitigation measures. </p><p>The approach of my Department is to focus on improving the emissions intensity of Irish production through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level combined with the practical application of emerging scientific knowledge.  The Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) supports capital investment in a number of target areas which will promote, among other things, sustainability (e.g. low emissions slurry spreading equipment, farm nutrient storage, and renewable energy and energy efficiency).  I recently made &euro;10 million available for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, following a comprehensive review of TAMS designed to increase its focus on sustainability.  Eligible investments include extension of support for Solar PV Installation to all sectors and support for LED Lighting as the only form of lighting to be grant aided.  In addition, other energy efficiency measures such as biomass boilers and water heating continue to be eligible investment items under TAMS.</p><p>Recently, my colleague Richard Bruton, Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment opened the second phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems for applications. Details of this scheme including the tariffs that apply are available on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>My Department continues to work at building this consensus around the need for the agriculture sector to make a positive contribution to the climate change debate and I will continue to engage extensively and work in partnership with a broad range of stakeholders in this regard.</p><p>I am confident the agricultural sector as a whole will meet this challenge and contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society, with collaboration, co-operation and collective responsibility being key in achieving this ambition and realising the potential of pro-active engagement.</p></reply>

The Plan commits to reducing public sector emissions by 30% and improving public sector energy efficiency by 50% by 2030. </p><p>The Plan also includes a commitment to require each public body to adopt a Climate Action Mandate. The mandate will involve a core group of requirements that every public body will have to meet, and a wider set that should be pursued by larger organisations.  The core requirements will have specific timelines for their introduction, be clearly measureable against a set of key performance indicators, and may include measures such as the following:</p><p>- facilitating employees in adopting lower carbon lifestyles </p><p>- every public building with public access to display an up-to-date Display Energy Certificate </p><p>- collaborating with suppliers and service providers in joint decarbonisation initiatives, including working with clients to adopt low carbon approaches such as the development of clusters</p><p>In addition, large public bodies may be required to commit to other measures such as:</p><p>- achieving formal environmental accreditation, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 </p><p>- a proportion of energy to come from certified renewable sources and/or onsite renewables </p><p>- active management of equipment containing refrigerant gases, including maintenance and disposal planning</p><p>A decision as to whether to undertake specific audits is a matter for senior management to consider when developing Climate Action Mandates for their respective Government Department, Office or Agency. </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Funding under my Department's main grant programmes are allocated taking the length of the road network in each local authority area into account with a view to ensuring as fair and equitable approach as possible for determining allocations. It is envisaged that grant allocations will continue to be determined on this basis.</p>  <p>  The 2019 regional and local roads budget has been fully allocated and the Department is not in a position to provide additional funding this year. The years during the recession saw major cuts in State grants for roads and funding is still only recovering to the levels required for adequate maintenance and renewal of the road network.  Having said that, 2019 has seen a welcome increase in grants and I am glad to note that Galway County Council has seen its overall roads allocation for 2019 rise to &euro;28.8m, an increase of over 47% when compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for Galway County Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme for the year taking account of available grant funding and its own resources.  Where additional costs arise on particular schemes and can be justified by reference to the requirements of the Public Spending Code, the Department may allow Councils to recoup extra costs from its grant allocation in the following year. </p>  <p>  The final decision on grant allocations for 2020 will be determined as part of the Estimates process and will not be announced until early 2020.</p></reply>

While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it may be the end of the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced. </p>  <p>  As soon as allocations have been made, my Department will carry out a review of all aspects of the 2018 round of the programme to include any possible improvements for the future. This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round but I fully expect that the SCP will again be open for new applications before the end of this year.   </p></reply>

This is because the Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes. </p><p>Income thresholds for assessment under the Scheme were raised substantially under Budget 2019. The significant increase in the Scheme's maximum net income threshold from &euro;47,000 to &euro;60,000<b></b>per annum, ensures that families with, in some cases, a gross income of up to &euro;100,000 will benefit from the Scheme.  </p><p>I am also very pleased that I have managed to adjust the lower income threshold, meaning that maximum subsidy rates will now be paid to all families with a reckonable income of up to &euro;26,000 (up from &euro;22,700). This &lsquo;poverty proofs&rsquo; the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the very highest subsidy rates under the scheme.</p><p>I would emphasise that this Scheme is designed in accordance with the principle of progressive universalism, having regard to the best interests of children and to the needs of the most economically vulnerable. Those with the least income will get the highest subsidy. We will also aim to support education, training and employment as routes out of poverty.  </p><p>It is estimated that 36,050 households with children in childcare will not be eligible for income assessed subsidy under the national childcare scheme due to their reckonable income exceeding the threshold of &euro;60,000. </p><p>This figure is arrived at taking account of</p><p>-Extrapolated 2016 household income distributions for families with 1, 2, and 3+ children</p><p>-The estimated number of children at different ages/stages of education</p><p>-The estimated uptake of those children based on patterns at their age/stage of education</p><p>-The behavioural patterns of parents in the upper/lower half of the income distribution.</p><p>However, of these 36,050 households, it is estimated that 13,200 will qualify for a universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per annum as they will have children under three or not yet eligible for the ECCE scheme.  A further 14,000 approximately will qualify for the free pre-school programme (ECCE) which is considered to reduce childcare costs for parents who are working by approximately &euro;5,500 per child over the course of the 2 year ECCE programme.</p><p>Finally, it is should be noted that the National Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, with income thresholds, subsidy rates and maximum hours and these can be adjusted over time as Government investment becomes available.  </p></reply>

The internet is an increasingly valuable resource for everyone, including children and young people, but it also exposes people to new risks including cyberbullying.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have a role in relation to the coordination or investigation of complaints about bullying, including cyberbullying.</p>  <p>  The welfare and protection of children and in particular, vulnerable children, is  everybody's concern.  Responsibility for children's welfare arises in all settings where children are and attaches to all responsible adults who come in contact with children.  The primary responsibility for protecting children rests with their parents but parents are supported in this role by a range of  service providers, state agencies, schools and professionals working with children and young people.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19.  The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments - Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved.  A Sponsors Group, involving the six Departments and chaired by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  There is a range of services available which can assist children and young people in coping with bullying situations for example;</p>  <p>  - www.webwise.ie - An initiative of Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills - provides a range of internet safety issues and concerns and offers advice and support for young people, teachers and parents.</p>  <p>  -  With regard to cyber bullying, the Office for Internet Safety, under the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, takes a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.</p>  <p>  The information and resources can be accessed through the single access point www.besafeonline.ie  </p>  <p>  The Children First Act 2015, which has been fully commenced since 11 December 2017, sets out a range of obligations for individuals and organisations in relation to child protection.  It is predicated on the clear principle that child protection issues are the responsibility of all Government Departments in their respective sectors, and that they must be embedded in the policy considerations of all Departments.</p>  <p>  The Children First Inter-Departmental Implementation Group (CFIDIG) is a statutory group set up under the Children First Act 2015.  Its membership is drawn from all Departments, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  Its role is in relation to promoting compliance with the Children First legislation and guidance.  While the CFIDIG does not have a direct role with regard to online safety, it does provide a forum for discussion on matters related to child protection.   </p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, my Department committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the  completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement.  An addendum to the guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on my Department's website in January.  In addition, the Child and Family Agency - Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.</p>  <p>  At a national and community level, youth organisations and voluntary youth services funded by my Department provide education programmes, run awareness campaigns about bullying and provide programmes for young people to give them the knowledge and skills to build supportive links and counter bullying behaviours. Specifically, my Department supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion / education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyber bullying with young people.</p></reply>

Tusla has adopted Signs of Safety as the national approach to practice, as well as a standard business process that sets out timelines for responses to referrals and assessment of reported concerns. All cases where a child is deemed to be at immediate risk receive a same day response, and after hours and weekends there is an Out of Hours social work service available. Cases that cannot be allocated to a social worker following preliminary enquries are described as 'active on duty' and receive a service from the duty social work team until a specific social worker is allocated. </p>  <p>  Tusla publishes monthly data on a range of metrics, including the waiting time for a case to be allocated to a social worker. Cases are prioritised as 'high', 'medium' or 'low' (it is important to note that priority level does not equate to the risk level of a case), and as of April 2019 there were 1,008 cases of 'high' priority awaiting allocation nationally . For context, there were 4,903 new referrals to child protection and welfare services in the same month. </p>  <p>  Timely response to reported concerns is a key objective for Tusla, and my Department officials work closely with the senior management team to reduce waiting times, including through investment in partnership, prevention and family support services that provide for a community-led response to referrals that do not reach the threshold for a child protection or social-work led intervention.  </p></reply>

The most recent Early Years Sector Profile 2017/2018, published in November 2018 indicates that existing childcare provision in general meets the needs nationwide in terms of capacity. Latest available data from Pobal indicates that in general there remains no issue in relation to capacity.</p><p>I am delighted to have secured &euro;8.86m in capital funding for childcare in 2019. This funding will be used to meet the most pressing needs of the sector with the ultimate aim of benefitting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure.</p><p>Furthermore, under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published earlier this year, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities with &euro;250 million in additional funding to expand childcare capacity over the duration of the Plan.</p><p>Also in 2019, I provided &euro;4m in capital funding to support additional places for under threes and &euro;1m to support additional places for school age care. Successful applicants have been notified and I anticipate that this funding will support the creation of approximately 3,600 new and extra spaces for children up to the age of 15.  </p><p>My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country. Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues. I would encourage anyone having difficulty in securing a place to make contact with their local CCC. Contact details for all of the CCCs, in addition to other information about the services they provide, may be found on www.myccc.ie</p><p>Many parents opt to use childminders to care for their pre-school and school-age children so I was delighted to secure &euro;500,000 in Budget 2019 to recruit a National Childminding Coordinator and a team of six Development Officers around the country, to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla and thus enable them to access subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), due to be launched later this year will also be a significant intervention to address this challenge. The NCS recognises the different costs associated with providing childcare for children of different ages. The Scheme will provide for a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under 1(up to &euro;5.10 per hour) and the next highest subsidy for children from 1 to under 3 (up to &euro;4.35 per hour).  </p><p>Through the National Childcare Scheme and a range of other measures, I am committed to changing Ireland&rsquo;s childcare system from one of the most expensive in the world to one of the very best. In designing the National Childcare Scheme, extensive research and consultations have been carried out to ensure that this goal is achieved and that the Scheme can help as many families as possible. </p><p>The National Childcare Scheme will greatly increase the number of families who can access financial support. The Scheme removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements of the existing support programmes, whereby a parent must be in receipt of certain Social Protection payments or a Medical Card in order to receive targeted supports. In this way, it aims to combat the poverty traps which may exist within the existing schemes, and to make work pay for parents. Many parents will see an increase to the level of subsidy they currently receive. For example, a family with a child aged two in full-time care (40 hours) and currently benefitting from the maximum subsidy of &euro;145 per week under CCS Band A, would see their subsidy increase to &euro;174 per week, an additional subsidisation of &euro;1,500 per annum. </p><p>I have also worked to poverty-proof the Scheme by ensuring that families at or below the relative income poverty line will benefit from the highest subsidy rates under the Scheme. Indeed, international reports have stated that the Scheme will significantly address affordability for lower income families, with analysis showing that Ireland will, for example, change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11<sup>th</sup>position. </p><p>Arrangements are in place to ensure that <i>no one loses out</i>in the initial transition to the new Scheme. So, whilst there may have been fears that, in a small number of cases, where a family currently receiving the maximum amount of financial support for full-time childcare under an existing programme may receive less under the new Scheme, they will not lose out.  The family can continue to access their current targeted supports (i.e. effectively remain on their current payment) until the end of August 2020.</p></reply>

Government investment in services for young people has increased since 2016 by, in the region of, &euro;8.5m.  In 2019 we have invested &euro;63.6M in current and capital funding in clubs, services and young people in 2019. </p><p>The Targeted Youth Funding Scheme has been allocated &euro;35.18 million for 2019 to provide out of school supports to young people in their local communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential by strengthening their personal and social competencies. Young people aged 10 to 24 years of age who are described in the National Youth Strategy as marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable will be the primary target group for services available through the new scheme. </p><p>A further &euro;11m is allocated to 30 national and major regional voluntary organisations through the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This funding is made available on an annual basis to 30 national and major regional voluntary organisations. The continued funding of voluntary youth organisations through the Scheme is intended to ensure the emergence, promotion, growth and development of youth organisations with distinctive philosophies and programmes aimed at the social education of young people. </p><p>For 2019, just over &euro;2m in funding is being provided to local youth groups through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which supports volunteer-led youth work activities at a local level.  These grants are made available to all youth clubs and groups through local Education and Training Boards. The scheme is open to over 1,600 youth groups and clubs. Each year, over 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware my Department is currently managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.  Future development and investment in youth services will be informed by the mapping exercise completed in 2017, which mapped youth service provision across the State as well as an Area Profiling, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement tool which was designed in collaboration with the Education and Training Board (ETB) sector and was officially launched in January 2019. This mapping and tool will assist the Department and the relevant ETBs in developing a detailed social demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  My Department is committed to working with ETBs to identify requirements in their area and facilitate decisions on service requirement by reference to evidenced need.</p></reply>

When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is immediately raised against the employer.</p>  <p>  The Department is obliged to make every effort to recover the debts owed to the Social Insurance Fund, in accordance with Section 32 of the Act.</p>  <p>  If a person is not in a position to make a repayment it is important that they engage with the Department's Debt Management Unit so that the relevant records can be updated to reflect the position.  Recent financial information has not been received in this case therefore my officials are unable to confirm inability to repay the debt. </p>  <p>  Again I would also like to remind the Deputy that any person who is experiencing difficulties with their mortgage repayments can avail of the Government's Abhaile service which is run by MABS (www.mabs.ie/abhaile.ie).  Borrowers who qualify for this scheme will incur no charge for using this service. </p>  <p>  I trust that this helps clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a considerable number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.  </p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.</p><p>If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.</p><p>The statistics required by the Deputy are set out in the following tables.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Appeal Receipts and Percentage of Favourable Decisions of Appeals Finalised 2012 &ndash;

It will continue to have a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; approach which recognises the shared responsibility across Government to achieve improved outcomes for the most vulnerable and marginalised in our society.  The new strategy will be published in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain good or service, and those who do not have this good or service for another reason e.g. because they do not want or do not need it.</p><p>The indicator adopted by the Social Protection Committee of the European Commission measures the percentage of the population that cannot afford at least three of the following nine items:</p><p>1. to pay their rent, mortgage or utility bills;  </p><p>2. to keep their home adequately warm;</p><p>3. to face unexpected expenses;</p><p>4. to eat meat or proteins regularly;</p><p>5. to go on holiday;</p><p>6. a television set;</p><p>7. a washing machine;</p><p>8. a car; or </p><p>9. a telephone.</p><p>The severe material deprivation rate is defined as the enforced inability to pay for at least four of the above-mentioned items.</p><p>As the following table shows, the EU-SILC severe material deprivation figure for Irish single parents for 2017 was 17.9%.  It is important to note that there has been a steady reduction of the severe material deprivation rate for single parents in Ireland over the period from 2012 to 2017, and the rate has almost halved from its high point of 32.3% in 2013. With the social welfare improvements in Budgets 2018 and 2019, this rate of reduction should continue to bring it more in line with the EU average.</p><p>Budget 2019 raised the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also increased the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment recipients to &euro;150 per week with effect from 25/03/19 (the highest disregard level to date).  The weekly rates of the Qualified Child Allowance in 2019 also increased by &euro;2.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;34) for children under 12, and by &euro;5.20 per week (from &euro;31.80 to &euro;37) for children of 12 and over.  This measure will benefit over 370,000 children and will help to further tackle child poverty. </p><p>With regard to increases introduced in Budget 2019 alone, for example, a lone parent working 15 hours per week at the National Minimum Wage is now better off by almost &euro;1,000 per year.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s social impact assessments of the last five Budgets (2015 to 2019) are an indicator of the improvements over that time for lone parents. These show a cumulative increase of &euro;43.75 in the average weekly household income of employed lone parents (and &euro;45.00 for unemployed lone parents). This compares favourably with a weekly increase of &euro;39.25 for the average household. </p><p><b>Severe Material deprivation rate: household type - Single Person with dependent children</b><table><tr><th></th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td>EU-28</td><td>17.1</td><td>18.4</td><td>21.6</td><td>20.7</td><td>19.2</td><td>17.1</td><td>15.7</td><td>13.3</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland </td><td>12.8</td><td>23.3</td><td>27.4</td><td>32.3</td><td>25.1</td><td>22.6</td><td>23.2</td><td>17.9</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: EU-SILC Data</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was the case with ex-Hurricane Ophelia on 16 October 2017, where trees down were reported in many areas across the country, with especially high numbers of roads blocked in the south and south-east regions, as well as resultant damage to electricity supply and communications networks. </p>  <p>  Tragically, the three fatalities which occurred during ex-Hurricane Ophelia, were associated with falling trees and breaking branches. The fatalities underlined the public safety risk of this event which informed the decision of the National Emergency Co-ordination Group to advise the public against undertaking non-essential activities or travel on 16 October 2017.</p>  <p>  In its role as Lead Government Department, my Department has prepared a review report on the severe weather events which affected Ireland between August 2017 and September 2018. The review report includes recommendations for  a risk management approach  to address the issue of trees and public safety. It is not seen as feasible or appropriate that trees be individually assessed at all locations. By definition, a risk management approach will involve consideration of a range of factors which could point to an elevated risk to public safety.  This subject is relevant for a number of Departments and public bodies, as well as for landowners. Under the Roads Act 1993, local authorities have responsibility for trees in public areas while trees on private lands, including lands adjoining public roads, are the legal responsibility of the land owner.</p>  <p>  The Report makes recommendations on the issue of a risk management approach to trees which can impact on public safety.  Implementation of recommendations in the Report that fall within the remit of my Department are in hand, and work on those within the remit of the Principal Response Agencies (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and local authorities) will continue under the aegis of the National Steering Group on Major Emergency Management.</p>  <p>  Recommendations in the Report which involve other Government Departments and those which relate to national co-ordination arrangements will be considered and taken forward through the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</p></reply>

These reports are known as the Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR), the most recent of which covers the period up to the end of Q1 2019. The Q1 2019 Social Housing CSR contains scheme by scheme information on the progress of over 20,300 new social housing homes, which are currently approved and progressing through planning, design and construction, as well as homes delivered to end Q1 2019.  This report can be found at the following link .</p><p>In relation to Traveller-specific accommodation, a dedicated budget is in place to fund the delivery of this accommodation, based on the requirements identified in local Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs).  The funding involved supports the delivery of various types of accommodation, including group housing, halting sites and the refurbishment of existing units.  </p><p>In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, and reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawdown in recent years, the Housing Agency, in 2017, commissioned a review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation to date.  This review had regard to targets contained in local authority TAPs and actual delivery, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  Following its consideration of the review, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee recommended that an Independent Expert Group be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  The work of this Expert Group is now at an advanced stage and the Group's report is expected shortly.  </p><p>In the context of this work, my Department will also review the reporting arrangements on the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p></reply>

This data is broken down by local authority area.</p><p>The number of forced repossessions by local authorities is low.  Repossession is always the last option and local authorities have shown extensive forbearance over the years in refraining from legal pursuit of housing loan arrears.  It is inevitable that a small proportion of loans may be deemed unsustainable, by both the local authority and the borrower. In these circumstances, the borrower may opt to voluntarily surrender the house to the local authority, thereby avoiding unnecessary legal and disposal fees. The local authority will also explore the possibility of Voluntary Sale or Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) with a borrower where a mortgage has been deemed unsustainable.</p><p>In this regard, it is of note that 435 houses have been dealt with under the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent Scheme from its introduction in 2013 to end 2018.  Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  It should be noted that the absence of a Mortgage to Rent scheme for local authority borrowers with unsustainable mortgages would have led to an increase in the repossession statistics.  Information on the number and cost of LAMTR cases completed in the period 2013 to 2018, broken down by local authority area, is available on my Department's website at the aforementioned link under the heading &quot;Local Authority Mortgage to Rent&quot;.</p><p>Repossessed units suitable for social housing are transferred into social housing stock &ndash; suitability (or otherwise) is determined by the local authority and considerations would include the location and suitability of each property, in terms of social housing need.  Any units that are not considered suitable for social housing can be put to the open market for sale.  The funding arrangement for transferring these units into social housing stock covers the lower of the amount owed by the borrower, or the current market value of the property, with some funding also for improvement works where required, to ensure the property is available for early re-letting.</p><p>It is considered that the bulk of repossessed properties have been transferred to permanent SH stock since 2013. The table (Table 1) sets out the LA areas where funding has been provided to transfer repossessed units into permanent stock.</p><p>To support local authorities in dealing with the shortfalls that arise through LAMTR cases and repossessions, or voluntary surrenders, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process Premium Fund was established in 2012.  This fund is centrally held by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to support the costs arising for local authorities in dealing with unsustainable cases and is contributed to by all local authorities through the application of a MARP premium to all existing and new loans.  Allocations from the MARP Premium Fund are managed by a dedicated Adjudication Panel consisting of local authority personnel.</p><p><b>Table: Capital funding provided to local authorities for the bringing into stock of repossessed and surrendered properties </b><table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Funding provided since 2013 to date</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;396,886</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;174,394</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;667,614</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   City</td><td>&euro;126,518</td></tr><tr><td>Cork   County</td><td>&euro;1,840,197</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>&euro;162,726</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;1,615,492</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin   City</td><td>&euro;22,003,066</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>&euro;519,860</td></tr><tr><td>Galway   City</td><td>&euro;156,103</td></tr><tr><td>Galway   County</td><td>&euro;668,848</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;507,521</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;4,033,919</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;724,670</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick   City and County</td><td>&euro;80,000</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;694,770</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;460,701</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;75,524</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;514,352</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;163,613</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;165,949</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;117,200</td></tr><tr><td>South   Dublin</td><td>&euro;651,067</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;404,234</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford   City and County</td><td>&euro;309,612</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;1,001,962</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;1,051,755</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;937,124</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;40,225,677</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is not possible to accurately predict the number of tenancies that will be supported by RAS at the end of 2019 as numbers in RAS vary as contracts end, tenants move on to other properties, landlords join or withdraw from the scheme, new tenancies are allocated or vacancies in contracted units are filled.
