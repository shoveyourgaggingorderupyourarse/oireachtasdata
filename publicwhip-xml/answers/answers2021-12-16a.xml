    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600052#WRA00600"><p>I am aware of media reports regarding internal documents from the MetroLink project team released under Freedom of Information.</p><p>And I can obviously appreciate the intense frustration among lots of people with regard to the timing of MetroLink&rsquo;s delivery. An awful lot of the discussion around delays relates to graphics used back in 2019 which set out an indicative timeline, premised on a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in Q2 2020. That Railway Order application has still not happened and there should not be any surprise that timelines premised on it happening are therefore out of date. That issue has been in the public domain since Q2 2020.</p><p>There are three determining factors at this point to MetroLink&rsquo;s progress &ndash;  </p><p>1. Government approval of the Preliminary Business Case under <i>Decision Gate 1</i>of the <i>Public Spending Code</i>; </p><p>2. The completion of all necessary documentation by Transport Infrastructure Ireland to allow it make the Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la; and </p><p>3. The Railway Order process itself and the time it might take.</p><p>My attention, and the attention of my Department, has been constantly focused on the first of these factors &ndash; securing Government approval of the Preliminary Business case. This is the issue where Ministerial attention is focused as without that Government approval the project cannot proceed.</p><p>I understand that a revised draft of the Preliminary Business Case is expected to be submitted very shortly to the Department for review in line with the <i>Public Spending Code</i>. Minister Ryan expects to seek Government approval for MetroLink during Q1 2022, if approved by Government then the project can proceed to the planning system</p><p>At a project level, work is continuing to finalise all the necessary documentation needed for a Railway Order application and should be completed by Q2 2022. At that point Transport Infrastructure Ireland will be able to lodge its Railway Order application.</p><p>These are the key dates and milestones for MetroLink right now.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600052#WRA01000"><p>The review of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy </i>will be undertaken next year and will be led by the National Transport Authority (NTA), in cooperation with Galway City Council and Galway County Council. </p><p>I believe there is a need to review the <i>Strategy </i>and take stock of developments since its publication in 2016.  As I have stated previously, my view is that a feasibility study for light rail in Galway would best be considered within the context of this review rather than carrying out a stand-alone study.  This approach allows for a multi-modal perspective and integration within an overall land-use plan. </p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the review will include a comprehensive analysis of changes to population projections, development density, employment forecasts and future travel demand patterns since the finalisation of the current <i>Strategy</i>.  This analysis will be utilised to reassess the public transport needs across Galway city and the potential role all modes of transport, including light rail, can play in meeting those needs.</p><p>I know from meeting many different stakeholders in the region the urgent need to focus on delivering the key elements of the existing <i>Galway Transport Strategy </i>such as BusConnects.  A significant amount of planning and design has already taken place which will enable construction activity in the coming years across active travel, bus and rail related projects including BusConnects.  I will continue to provide support in that regard with funding and other assistance offered through the NTA. I look forward to the Deputy's support as we seek to deliver on this ambition in the years ahead.</p></reply>

However, I note that he is not involved in the day-to-day operations, provision, or maintenance of public transport services, including matters related to subsidised rail services. </p>  <p>  The Free Travel Scheme is a non-statutory scheme administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (D/EASP), which is available to persons aged 66 years or over who are permanently resident in the State, and to all carers in receipt of Carers' Allowance.  The Scheme is also available to certain people with disabilities and people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  </p>  <p>  The fundamental principle of the Scheme as originally envisaged, is to utilise spare capacity on public transport services which operate, in any case, with or without eligible persons.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the company currently make available two booking options for free travel pass holders who wish to reserve seats for travel. Holders of a free travel pass have the option to book free of charge up to 60 minutes before departure on the company website at www.irishrail.ie; or they can phone Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's Customer Call Centre for further assistance if they are not familiar with the online booking process, where customer care representatives will be happy to assist them with their queries.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have further advised that their digital channels roadmap has identified continuous improvements to their booking system. The roadmap includes plans for a redesigned ticket selection process in 2022, subject to successful testing and technical feasibility.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recruited in excess of 100 Customer Service Officers across the rail network who will operate on-board the majority of Intercity services, and who can issue Free Travel Pass tickets and other tickets while on-board, including cross-route tickets, to eligible persons.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600052#WRA01600"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for her question and the opportunity to discuss the very serious issue of anti-social behaviour on our public transport systems.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour is a broad societal issue that we are currently facing to which public transport is not immune, and I recognise that those who work and commute daily using our public transport network are most directly impacted by any incidents which occur. </p>  <p>  I am particularly aware of the concern of women regarding safety for women travelling on public transport  and this was highlighted in the 2020 study commissioned by Transport Infrastructure Ireland "Travelling in a Woman's Shoes".  That study highlighted that 55% of women stated they would not use public transport at night and 34% of women stated that feelings of insecurity have prevented them from travelling. The report also highlighted that 1 in 3 public transport users have seen or experienced some form of harassment or violence while using public transport. This presents a challenge at a time when we are committed to increasing usage of public transport and to achieve modal shift.</p>  <p>  While it should be noted that the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident, I am of course concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to protect the safety of all passengers and staff.</p>  <p>  The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour. The companies have advised me of a number of initiatives being undertaken to help ensure the safety and security of both the travelling public and their staff. </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have advised that, in conjunction with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a joint focus on public order and anti-social behaviour has been in place since May 2021, with a particular emphasis on the Greater Dublin Area and the DART, Northern Line and Heuston to Portlaoise services.</p>  <p>  As of the 13th of December, four Garda Response Hubs are now in operation to support on-board staff at: Mallow; Limerick Junction; Thurles; and Portlaoise.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, an Athlone Garda Response Hub has been approved and will commence operations on 1st January 2022, with additional Response Hubs in Kildare (Kildare Town or Newbridge) and Roscommon (Castlereagh) in negotiation.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently supporting Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in carrying out on-board patrols on scheduled late night services over the Christmas period across the network in addition to ongoing joint Garda/Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operations, including high visibility patrols of stations where specialist Garda Teams included the Garda Dog Unit will be deployed.</p>  <p>  A text alert service has also been introduced to enable customers to discreetly report anti-social behaviour incidents</p>  <p>  Transdev Dublin Light Rail, who operate the Luas network on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, employ 50 security staff. These staff liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work, such as through the Operation Citizen initiative, commenced in October, which has increased the visual presence of Garda patrols, particularly in the city centre where heavy footfall Luas Stops are located. Concurrently they have reported that they are seeing a decrease in anti-social behaviour of circa 40% - at the same time as experiencing an increase in tram travel. </p>  <p>  Both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have reported that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low on their services and also noted a declining trend, which is positive.</p>  <p>  The entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 10 internal cameras and two external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.</p>  <p>  All of the company's buses are in radio contact with Central Control. Any instances of disruption or concerns around security are immediately reported and services are suspended as necessary. The company also has mobile inspectors in the city centre, who are available to attend incidents as required.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff and driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor, single-deck and double-deck bus fleet. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.</p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date have had a number of successes in tackling anti-social behaviour, particularly on the northern DART through teamwork between I&Eacute;&rsquo;s security provider, the Howth Junction Security Centre, Revenue Protection Unit staff, station staff and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, however this is an issue which will require continuing joint action. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, both Minister Ryan and I will continue to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600052#WRA01900"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question although I think there are probably three linked but separate questions I need to address.</p><p>Firstly, both Minister Ryan and I were delighted to secure Government approval last week for DART+ West. The approval Government issued is known as <i>Decision Gate 1 </i>approval in the <i>Public Spending Code</i>and means that DART+ West can now move forward into the statutory planning system which is a hugely significant milestone for the project and the programme as a whole.</p><p>The second part of the question relates to the planning process itself and there&rsquo;s two aspects to that:</p><p>Firstly, there is the work required to get the planning application ready and then there is the length of time that will be required to consider the actual planning application. At the moment Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are considering the submissions received during the most recent public consultation on DART+ West. I understand there are a couple of issues in particular that they need to consider further before they are ready to lodge any planning application, so it is expected that won&rsquo;t happen until Q2 next year. </p><p>Secondly, there is the length of time a significant application like this will take in the statutory planning system.  I cannot say definitively how long that will take, but past experience would suggest 12 -18 months is not unusual for a decision on an application of this nature. </p><p>The final part of the question relates to the business case for the project and whether it might be updated by the time planning approval is granted. In short, the business case must be updated as that is a requirement of the <i>Public Spending Code</i>. The business case submitted at <i>Decision Gate 1</i>is known as the Preliminary Business Case and it will be refined as the project moves through <i>Decision Gate 2 &ndash; Pre-Tender Approval</i>before it reaches <i>Decision Gate 3</i>which is Final Business Case stage.</p></reply>

A draft <i>Strategy</i>was published in September 2020 and was open for public consultation for 8 weeks. </p><p>Since the conclusion of last year&rsquo;s public consultation exercise, the NTA has conducted further analytical work to inform the next iteration of the <i>Strategy. </i>I understand that among the issues raised during the public consultation were issues related to the role of rail in the region, including potential connectivity to Shannon Airport and additional stations such as Moyross, and that role is under further examination by the NTA for inclusion in a revised draft <i>Strategy</i>. </p><p>I understand that the NTA intends to undertake a second round of public consultation on a revised draft strategy early next year.Following receipt of feedback from the second round of public consultation, it is intended to finalise the<i>Strategy </i>and publish it as the completed transport investment framework for the metropolitan area.</p><p>When finalised, the <i>Strategy </i>will set out the framework for investment in transport for the Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area for the next 20 years including proposals for rail investment.  Importantly the Strategy will be integrated within relevant land-use plans and that integration is crucial if we are to enable the emergence of a more sustainable Limerick. A Limerick that provides better access for citizens to work, education and leisure opportunities through improved active travel, bus and rail infrastructure. </p><p>Minister Ryan and I look forward to working with the Deputies as we look to improve the transport network in the Limerick area in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Current average occupancy levels are low and there is potential for parking on the site.

Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary.

These two commitments relate to the examination of &quot;<i>the development of national tourism trails linking our ferry port and rail network&rdquo;</i>and working &quot;<i>with the ports and ferry companies to increase the number of foot and cycle passengers</i>&rdquo;. </p><p>In relation to the first commitment, the development and promotion of tourism product experiences, such as tourism trails, are operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland &ndash; the National Tourism Development Authority.  Queries on such matters should be addressed to my colleague Catherine Martin, TD, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  </p><p>I understand from that Department that the new National Development Plan 2021-2030 (NDP) provides for the delivery of enhanced amenity through investment in tourism product development.  Accordingly, the new NDP supports the delivery of projects &ndash; such as the Wild Atlantic Walkway &ndash; that will support a tourism sector that is sustainable from an environmental, social and economic perspective, with the development and enhancement of quality tourist attractions/experiences and activity-based tourism amongst the priority areas for tourism capital investment. </p><p>In relation to the second commitment under my remit as Minister for Transport, as well as another commitment to &quot;<i>work to ensure that ferry companies provide access for foot passengers without cars</i>&quot;, my officials undertook a review of the services and facilities available to accommodate foot and cycle passengers at our seaports and on ferry services out of Ireland. While the travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19 and the impacts of Brexit delayed this work for a time, a resumption of engagement with the shipping operators on the issue of foot passengers will commence shortly.</p><p>The Department will also engage with the passenger ports at Dublin, Rosslare and Cork on their plans for ensuring continued access to ferry services for foot passengers, working with the ferry companies in this regard.  Based on the outcome of that engagement, the Department will assess what changes need to be encouraged to enhance the passenger experience and make it a more attractive option for the travelling public.</p><p>A key priority for all Government departments, including Transport, is meeting the carbon emissions targets under the Climate Action Plan. It is acknowledged that both rail and shipping contribute a smaller proportion to the total volume of atmospheric emissions compared to road vehicles and air transport. As such, increased use of these modes is a more sustainable form of transport and should be encouraged.</p></reply>

Integrated and reliable transport helps us meet our climate obligations by enabling more people to switch to a sustainable option as their preferred transport mode.</p><p>As I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy will agree, transport needs are not uniform across the country and tailored solutions are needed for both urban and rural areas. Active travel initiatives together with improved and expanded public transport services across the country are essential for promoting modal shift. Projects like BusConnects in cities and Connecting Ireland in rural areas will help provide viable alternatives to the private car.  </p><p>BusConnects aims to support citizens&rsquo; travel needs by offering affordable, frequent and high-quality services throughout the day across the city-regions.It will overhaul the current bus system in the cities by implementing a network of &lsquo;next generation&rsquo; bus corridors, which includes segregated cycling facilities, on the busiest routes.  This will make journeys faster, predictable, and reliable. </p><p>BusConnects will also introduce a new system of ticketing known as Next Generation Ticketing and cashless payments. This will enable seamless transfers between bus services by reducing time consuming interactions with drivers and cutting boarding times. The ticketing equipment that is procured for BusConnects will be required to be capable of being used anywhere and will act as a foundation to introduce modern payment methods across all modes of public transport.</p><p>But improved public transport can&rsquo;t be just about cities. The Connecting Ireland plan is a major national public transport initiative developed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) with the aim of increasing public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns. It will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country.</p><p>The Deputy will be pleased to learn that Connecting Ireland proposes to specifically expand the public transport network in rural areas and to increase service levels. Under Connecting Ireland, the NTA is proposing an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of the five year Connecting Ireland plan. It will extend public transport services into many rural villages and areas for the first time and is a hugely important initiative .</p><p>Finally, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>which my Department has undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. It will strategically examine the rail network on the island of Ireland in relation to improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility, and supporting balanced regional development.</p></reply>

My Department assists with the implementation of these measures. In this regard, there has been a suite of measures, protocols, and requirements put in place regarding international travel, which have developed and evolved as the pandemic has progressed.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health recently made regulations that required that from the 5th of December, all passengers travelling to Ireland, with very limited exemptions, must show proof of a negative test for COVID-19.  Passengers who do not have proof of vaccination or recovery are required to show a negative ('not detected') RT-PCR test which was carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival in Ireland.  Passengers who have proof of vaccination or recovery from COVID-19 can show a negative ('not detected') antigen test which was carried out no more than 48 hours before arrival. </p>  <p>  There are obligations on carriers to ensure that all travellers are in possession of an electronic Passenger Locator Form (ePLF) receipt and, unless exempted, a negative result from a RT-PCR test administered within 72hrs of arrival or a negative antigen test result from a test administered within 48hrs of arrival.</p>  <p>  Where exemptions are not declared, carriers will be required to deny boarding to passengers that do not provide evidence of completion of the ePLF or who do not have evidence of the required negative/not detected Covid-19 test result. </p>  <p>  The exemptions from the requirement to have an additional test result continues to apply to those previously exempt from declaring their health status, including those aged 11 and under, transport workers in possession of a valid Annex 3 certificate and air and maritime crew.  These exemptions are declared on the ePLF.</p>  <p>  From the start of the pandemic maritime and air carriers have cooperated with Government's international travel measures. Carriers have reported denying boarding to significant numbers of passengers for non-compliance with the various regulations. In situations where doubt has arisen, carriers have contacted the Department for clarification in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  It has been the strong advice of the European Commission that relevant checks are carried out at points of departure, rather than at points of arrival. This is in order to avoid unnecessary double checking of documentation, and to avoid lengthy queues and passenger congestion at ports of entry to the State.  </p>  <p>  To support the public health efforts, the Border Management Unit (BMU) at Dublin Airport, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the other ports of entry to the State, conduct spot checks of health documentation.</p>  <p>  Over the last two weeks, the BMU has significantly increased the level of spot checks of all arriving passengers to Dublin Airport, with up to 100% of passengers from certain flights checked.  </p>  <p>  Where a passenger presents without the correct health documentation they are referred to the Garda National Immigration Bureau for further action.</p></reply>

The development, implementation and oversight of the projects as outlined in the <i>Galway Transport Strategy</i>is a matter first and foremost for the National Transport Authority and the local authorities who are working to ensure that they are delivered as intended.</p><p>As the Deputy noted, Galway County Council have received planning approval from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the N6 Galway City Ring Road. The Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland will now study the conditions outlined within it. If there are no legal challenges, the project will move to the next stage which includes providing for land acquisition and developing a procurement strategy. The project also needs to be assessed under a range of criteria in line with the <i>Public Spending Code</i>. Only then can a Government decision be made on whether the project can ultimately proceed to construction. Additionally, an independent review will take place as part of the <i>External Assurance Process</i>for major public investment projects</p><p>I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the review of the <i>Galway Transport Strategy </i>which is due to commence  next year. It will be led by the National Transport Authority in cooperation with Galway City Council and Galway County Council.  It will include a comprehensive analysis of changes to population projections, development density, employment forecasts and future travel demand patterns since the finalisation of the current Strategy.  This analysis will be utilised to reassess the public transport needs across Galway city and the potential role all modes of transport can play in meeting those needs.</p><p>In the meantime, implementation will continue on the current <i>Galway Transport Strategy.</i>This includes the Galway BusConnects programme with key elements like the Cross-City Link and the Dublin Road Corridor advancing at pace. Further projects include the roll-out of improved active travel infrastructure, the Safe Routes to School programme, redevelopment of Ceannt Station and the improvements planned for Oranmore station and track infrastructure. </p><p>I look forward to working with the Deputy on improving sustainable mobility infrastructure in Galway in the coming years.</p></reply>

It has implications right across the economy. With regard to the impact on transport, the Government will continue to monitor impacts on trade and key supply chains as it has done through the challenges arising from Brexit and the global pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Road hauliers are currently supported in relation to the cost of diesel through the Diesel Rebate Scheme, introduced in 2013.  In Budget 2020, in recognition of the challenging environment that the haulage industry faced at that time with regard to the prospect of a disorderly Brexit, the scheme was enhanced to the extent that when the retail price of auto diesel is over &euro;1.07, the marginal rate of compensation increases to 60% of the excise paid up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre when the price of auto diesel is &euro;1.16 or over (VAT exclusive).   In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, the 2020 enhancement has been maintained since. It is worth noting also that businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs. </p>  <p>  Minister Ryan and I met on 10 December with representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) to discuss a range of issues including fuel prices, decarbonisation of the HGV sector and skills issues including the HGV driver shortage. </p>  <p>  At the meeting with IRHA, the Department agreed to consider a proposal to expand the relief available to hauliers under the Diesel Rebate Scheme, but with a link to the phasing out of older, more polluting vehicles and an overall reduction in emissions from the sector. Details of that proposal are to be submitted by the IRHA to the Department.  The meeting with the IRHA was constructive and informative and both sides agreed to reconvene again in the New Year.</p></reply>

The HGV driver shortage is not confined to Ireland; it has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for a number of years now.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors.</p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain<b></b>Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland.  The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies. In July, I asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage issue and make recommendations, with specific regard to actions that can be taken by Government and the industry. These recommendations are aimed at ameliorating the supply issue, without undermining the working conditions and health and safety of drivers or other road users.  The Group is finalising its recommendations for submission to me in the coming days.</p><p>Much work is already underway in this space.</p><p>The promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers.  My Department has engaged with the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal JobsIreland.ie. I have written to Education and Training Boards across Ireland to offer support for the many HGV driver training courses offered by the ETBs around the country.</p><p>Regarding driver testing in Ireland, in the 4 weeks prior to December 12th, an average of 154 tests for HGV drivers were carried out by RSA testers each week, with a pass rate of almost 73%. This means that 112 HGV drivers were qualified on average each week.</p><p>Regarding recruitment of drivers from abroad, I understand that the DSP organises events in the EU/EEA labour market for sectors where there are particularly acute labour shortages and that it will run a transport-focused recruitment event early in the new year.  My Department will engage with industry to promote the event.  </p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice.  Following engagement with my colleague Minister of State English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA has been removed.  These drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence.  Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements. </p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. The Government&rsquo;s aim is to develop a strategy that will focus on generating efficiencies and improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  We remain mindful of the driver and skills shortage facing the sector, and a section of the Haulage Strategy will focus on this.</p><p>I will continue to proactively engage with the freight transport, distribution and logistics sectors and the Government is committed to continuing to support the industry. It is vitally important for education, industry, and government to work together to enhance the appeal of a career in road haulage and logistics, so that the sector can both attract and retain talent.</p></reply>

Since January 2019, there have been very regular discussions with shipping companies and other maritime stakeholders about the issue of maritime connectivity.  In that time, we have consistently received strong assurances from the shipping companies that if there is an increase in demand for shipping capacity on direct routes to Continental Europe, they would respond. </p>  <p>  This assertion has been borne out. We have witnessed throughout 2020 and 2021 an unprecedented response from the shipping industry in terms of increasing capacity to match market demand. It has occurred across all relevant modes and has drawn from all available responses. These responses include (1) utilization of surplus capacity, (2) increasing capacity by altering schedules, (3) redeploying vessels within their fleets, and (4) adding new capacity in the form of additional vessels. </p>  <p>  New/additional direct ferry links with increased capacity including to Cherbourg, Dunkerque, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff, Le Havre and Santander have come on stream and are seeing high demand. These responses and the new services launched over this and last year demonstrate the commitment of the shipping companies to the Irish market.  </p>  <p>  Overall, Brexit has been a positive boost for Rosslare Europort with the largest growth of any port in the number of direct European services with sailings increasing from three a week in January 2020 to 14 return journeys currently (28 weekly). Since early 2021 new services have been commenced by DFDS to Dunkirk and by Stena Line and Brittany Ferries to Cherbourg and most recently to Le Havre.</p>  <p>  In terms of where this increased direct traffic has been handled, Rosslare Europort has captured more of the increase in ROI &ndash; EU RoRo traffic, in proportional terms. Of the 142,000 additional RoRo units carried in the first nine months of 2021, approximately 49% travelled through Rosslare Europort. Since 2015, Rosslare represented c.14% of ROI &ndash; EU traffic. In 2021, it represents approx. 31%.</p>  <p>  It is clear, that when market demand is demonstrated to be there, shipping operators respond and capacity is added, and is added quickly. It is vital that the haulage sector and businesses continue to engage with shipping operators to clearly communicate their needs.  I will continue to keep a close eye on developments, in conjunction with the Department and the IMDO. </p></reply>

While all options are on the table as we strive to achieve carbon neutrality, we must ensure that if policies like this are pursued that they are evidence based and that viable alternatives exist for people to continue to make their journeys. </p><p>My Department has recently published the <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study</i>, pursuant to Action 81 of the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>2019. The purpose of the Study is to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city. The Study focused on addressing four main challenges facing our cities: decarbonisation, air quality, congestion, and, improving the overall urban environment. The Study is evidence-based using insight from an extensive international best practice review, national and local stakeholder engagement and supported by detailed qualitative (Phase 1) and quantitative (Phase 2) appraisal - available to view at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c6571-five-cities-demand-management-study/</i></p><p>While the Study has identified that the introduction congestion charges can prove effective, the Study also found that there are a variety of alternative measures that can be pursued with greater effect. The three priority measures that have been recommended for implementation across the five cities are:  </p><p>- Develop and embed the concept of 15-minute neighbourhoods through national and local plans and strategies, providing resources to incentivise their implementation through national funding/grants schemes. </p><p>- Enhance delivery of the National Planning Framework.  </p><p>- Public Parking Controls.</p><p>Importantly, the Study has also made clear that there is no single solution to tackling the challenges facing our urban environments. Utilising an integrated Travel Demand Management approach to policy development, planning and delivery of our land use and transport systems will be fundamental to addressing these challenges in the coming years. </p><p>In line with our Climate Action Plan commitments, my Department, NTA and the Regional Assemblies are engaging to identify a pathway for the implementation of suitable demand management measures at national and local level, and to advancing these measures by 2025.</p></reply>

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 945,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required. </p><p>The State has an important role to play in normalising EVs and promoting their uptake. A positive policy environment has been fostered with a generous suite of financial and taxation incentives in place for those buying an EV as well as an extensive publicly accessible recharging infrastructure network. Presently, there are approximately 47,500 EVs on Irish roads; a significant step-up is required if Ireland is to achieve its Climate Action Plan EV target.</p><p>To assist in this aim, the work of Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce, established by my two Departments to consider a full suite of potential measures available to Government, concentrated on EVs and, as part of this work, the important leadership role that Public Bodies and Government Departments can play in encouraging LEV uptake was considered. The Taskforce recommended the introduction of a new public procurement framework for EVs by 2020 and this recommendation was echoed in the 2021 Climate Action Plan where Action 276 is to &quot;Set a roadmap for more LEVs in Public Sector Fleets&quot;.  </p><p>In addition, the former Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 180,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. In its report, published in September, the Group made a recommendation to:  </p><p>- Develop proposals to support EV sales in the commercial fleet, including but not limited to car</p><p>- rental/leasing companies, company vehicles and car sharing services, in order to stimulate a greater second-hand EV market having regard to potential Exchequer costs</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement has drawn up fixed price procurement frameworks for the supply of long and medium range battery electric passenger cars and vans to public sector bodies. Full details on how to use the framework as well as pricing and supplier contact details can be found on the <i>www.ogp.gov.ie</i>website.  These Frameworks will greatly assist Government departments and bodies to purchase electric cars and vans.  As battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition to EVs. </p><p>I am supportive of all appropriate and proportionate supports for the EV industry providing momentum towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s emission reduction commitment.  </p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport.  That is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority in conjunction with the relevant public transport operators.</p><p>The continued operation of public transport services has been a priority throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Government is committed to ensuring that essential transport services, and passengers utilising these services, are protected and supported.  </p><p>The Chief Medical Officer and the Health Service Executive (HSE) are responsible for the issuing of guidelines in relation to public health and these advices apply across all modes of public transport. Public transport operators have been advised of, and are guided by, public health instructions issued by the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre in relation to COVID-19.</p><p>As part of the further easing of a range of Covid-19 restrictions, the Government decided that from 01/09/2021 public transport could return to operating at 100% capacity. This decision was taken as demand for public transport services had steadily continued to increase week-on-week, with the return of schools, third level education, and the return of more employees to the workplace. The National Transport Authority (NTA) continue to liaise with transport operators to monitor passenger trends and any challenges that may arise as  transport returns to full capacity.  </p><p>A number of measures have been implemented by public transport operators to ensure the safe operation of services, including: </p><p>- enhanced cleaning regimes for vehicles and stations; </p><p>- distribution of personal protective equipment to public transport staff; </p><p>- distribution of hand sanitizer on vehicles and at stations; and </p><p>- display of public health advice and guidelines on vehicles and in stations</p><p>In addition, notices have been applied within vehicles where windows can be opened, to encourage passengers to leave them open for ventilation purposes.  </p><p>The NTA continues to engage with public transport operators regarding the safe operating of services during the pandemic.  In light of the NTA's responsibilities in this area, I have also referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA.

This funding will provide Cork Airport with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity into 2022.</p>  <p>  Next year, funding of &euro;36 million will be provided under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025, supporting regional airports of Cork, Shannon, Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry.  This budget allocation represents a significant increase in funding available under the Programme in 2022 which takes account of the broadening of the Programme to include both Cork and Shannon Airports.</p>  <p>  The level of funding provided to Cork Airport is a clear indication of the importance Government attaches to Cork Airport being well positioned to weather the current crisis and for recovery and growth into the future. The Government is fully cognisant of the ongoing and deep impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector. As was the case in 2021, the Government will continue to keep Aviation Supports under review in 2022.</p></reply>

The biofuel obligation, provided for under Part V of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 (as amended), requires fuel suppliers to include a certain proportion of biofuels in fuels for use in road transport. Currently, the biofuel obligation rate is 11% (i.e., not less than 11 litres in every 100 litres of road transport fuel is biofuel) and will increase to 13% next year. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement which I published last month sets out a future trajectory of increase in biofuels use in land transport in line with Climate Action Plan targets to 2030, as well as a range of measures and incentives for future supply of renewable fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. My Department also intends, in early 2022, to carry out an assessment concerning the future availability of renewable fuels, which will inform implementation of this Policy beyond 2025.</p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), as administrator of the biofuel obligation, publish monthly statistics on volumes (litres) of oil consumption which is subject to the NORA levy and Biofuel levy obligation. NORA and obligated parties under the biofuel obligation submit raw data on biofuels to the OLA (database) in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, primarily in the context of blending biofuels with fossil fuels to adhere to the biofuel obligation. </p>  <p>  In 2020, over 239 million litres of biofuels were placed on the Irish road transport fuel market, mainly biodiesel and ethanol and to a lesser extent bio-liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Small quantities of biomethane were also placed on the market.  Biofuels in transport replaced c. 209 million litres of fossil fuels and avoided approximately 520ktCO2eq greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030, under the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021, biofuels will deliver approximately 18% of the GHG reductions projected in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  While the reporting of biofuel supply is for road transport consumption currently, considering the future planned and potential demand for renewable fuels across all sectors, it is expected that biofuel volumes may be reported in the various transport sectors over the coming years. As indicated, the recently published Policy Statement includes a commitment to expand the biofuel obligation to the rail sector from 2024 or earlier, subject to the readiness of the rail sector.</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fit for 55&rsquo; package of proposals also set out increased ambitions for renewable energy across all sectors of the economy and transport modes. The proposals include directives that will increase the share of renewable fuel in land, aviation and maritime transport.</p></reply>

These include targets for increasing the amount of biofuel blended in road transport fuels by 2030, with an interim 2025 target and a commitment to carry out a review of the supply or renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, green hydrogen and biogas.</p>  <p>  I published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement on the 25th November. The Policy Statement sets out the future trajectory of increase in renewable fuels use in land transport, including incentives for future supply for use in transport of fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. </p>  <p>  As set out in the first action of the Renewable Fuels Policy and further to the Climate Action Plan target, my Department will engage with the Industry, Academia and others to ensure that the supply of indigenous and imported biofuels undergoes a rigorous assessment on full life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction to ensure it is consistent with recast Renewable Energy Directive (REDII) greenhouse gas reduction levels. This assessment will also include consideration of impacts concerning indirect land-use change (ILUC), biodiversity pollution and a value assessment in terms of cascading use of bio-materials.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. </p><p>Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 47,500 now. </p><p>In addition, my Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group </i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales.  </p><p>The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. </p><p>The Working Group examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles. The Report finds that there is divergence within the research community as to when TCO in economic terms cost parity will be achieved with some studies estimating that it is likely to occur in the middle of this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale, while others<b><sup></sup></b>argue that the cross-over point may not occur until towards the end of the decade. </p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that:</p><p>- The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and</p><p>- An <i>Office for Low </i>Emission<i>Vehicles</i>should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new <i>Office</i>should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastructure strategy is due for publication early next year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</p><p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. </p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>The Department is aware of initiatives to retrofit internal combustion engine cars to electric vehicles, and is giving the matter active consideration. Innovations that provide reliable solutions for people willing to transition to electric vehicles are to be welcomed, particularly if they provide options for people who might be unable to purchase a new vehicle. </p><p>There are various measures to consider when determining the effectiveness of this type of initiative. Department officials are actively engaging with car conversion companies on this matter.</p></reply>

A national charging infrastructure strategy is due for publication early next year which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure including along the motorway network.   </p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

It generally underpins our economic development, the expansion of our tourism sector and in particular our success in attracting foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, the contribution of aviation to climate change is undeniable and the need to move towards a more sustainable model is now fully accepted across the industry.</p>  <p>  Sustainable aviation is a very broad term that encompasses many facets of the aviation industry from greener airports, the use of sustainable aviation fuels, improved aircraft technology and more efficient air traffic management.</p>  <p>  Whilst my Department does not have any plans at present to introduce incentives in relation to sustainable aviation, it is considering strategies to promote the sustainability of the industry through the EU Fit for 55 package of proposals which includes, inter alia, measures to increase the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and proposed amendments to the aviation aspects of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. </p>  <p>  For example, Ireland strongly supports the ReFuelEU Initiative which will mandate fuel suppliers to blend increasing levels of SAF with kerosene over the coming decades. Consultations are already ongoing to ascertain the impact the proposed mandated levels of SAF will have on the industry, and although Ireland currently imports over 90% of kerosene, it is possible that as the blending mandates increase, production of sustainable and synthetic aviation fuel may take place domestically.</p>  <p>  Separately, Ireland is also a keen proponent of the proposed Reform of the Single European Skies (SES) Regulatory Framework which will modernise the management of European airspace and establish more sustainable and efficient flightpaths. This can reduce air transport carbon emissions by up to 10%.</p>  <p>  As a &lsquo;technology taker&rsquo; Ireland does not have an indigenous aircraft or engine manufacturing industry and is unlikely to play a significant role in the development of new aircraft technology. It does, however, have the potential for mass generation of green energy and therefore green hydrogen. As outlined in the Climate Action Plan, green hydrogen will be an important tool in permanently decarbonising transport, including through the use of blended Sustainable Aviation Fuels and there may be opportunities for Ireland in this space as the technology develops over the coming years. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport energy, including updates to the Biofuel Obligation Scheme. While sustainable aviation fuels are not obligated under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, fuel suppliers that place SAF on the market in Ireland can apply for biofuel obligation scheme certificates for this. Additionally, the Department of Transport intends to carry out a review of the supply of renewable transport fuels in Ireland, such as biofuels, advanced biofuels, e-fuels, synthetic fuels, green hydrogen and biogas in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of funding measures to assist our airports with regard to climate resilience, including through the Regional Airports Programme (RAP) 2021-2025. The previous RAP provided funding for safety and security projects, however the 2021-2025 Programme now includes funding for capital projects with a sustainability focus. The funding is aimed at helping expedite airports&rsquo; efforts to reduce emissions in line with the 2021-2025 Programme&rsquo;s goal to move towards carbon neutrality. The COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 also supported projects incorporating measures to support sustainability.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Climate Action Fund was established on a statutory basis in 2020. At least &euro;500 million will be available from this Fund over the period to 2027 to support projects, initiatives and research across the economy that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets, and goals.  To date, over &euro;140 million has been committed from the Climate Action Fund for a range of projects. Opportunities to secure support from the Climate Action Fund will also be available during 2022, particularly in relation to projects and initiatives that are aligned with the recently published Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  In relation to other possible funding opportunities, the European Union's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) supports the development of Europe's transport, energy and digital services networks. Funding is awarded on a competitive basis and information on open calls under this programme and others is available on the EU's funding and tenders portal. Likewise the EU Innovation Fund which is financed from revenue from the auctioning of 450 million allowances from 2020 to 2030 under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), aims to fund innovative technology that delivers the avoidance of Green House Gas emissions. In Ireland this fund is administered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></reply>

Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and  </p><p>- An <i>Office for Low </i>Emission<i>Vehicles</i>should be established, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure. The new <i>Office</i>should also take charge of developing and launching an extensive communication and engagement campaign, whole of Government in coverage, to drive the availability and understanding of key information regarding EVs, tailored to household, business and public sector consumers. </p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is being kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable. </p></reply>

The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 has accordingly enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the LPT return forms submitted by residential property owners last month in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information together with information from other available sources will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  The LPT returns are currently being analysed by Revenue and include information on the number and location of unoccupied properties, and the reasons for and duration of this, as of 1 November 2021. I look forward to receiving the results of Revenue&rsquo;s analysis of this information in 2022.  This analysis will be used together with other available sources of information to inform the optimum design of a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  As I have articulated on several occasions it is the clear intention of the Government to introduce a Vacant Property Tax next year.  In designing the tax it will be important to achieve an appropriate balance between placing enough pressure on vacant home owners to allow the measure to actually work as an incentive, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners in a discriminatory way.  </p></reply>

This Office, which I chair, is situated within the Department of Finance and has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, and representative organisation on issues surrounding competition. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. In relation to this, the Office is working with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market or seeking current incumbents, to expand their existing operations here.  </p><p>In recent weeks, as part of this work I met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland. They have confirmed that they are committed to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and other reforms, to customers. They also reiterated their support for the reform agenda and that they are adhering to the Guidelines in direct settlements with their clients. The need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover, particularly high-risk/high-footfall areas, such as leisure activities was impressed upon providers at all our engagements. Some insurers indicated they are actively considering growing their business in certain areas.Separately, I also recently met with a leading international insurance brokerage firm, and discussed both the question of supply and the Irish market in general. In this regard, I also believe that insurance brokerage firms have an important role in assisting clients in sourcing cover, particularly in niche areas where their expertise and underwriting networks can add real value.</p><p>In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan which will bring benefits to individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland. </p></reply>

This, of course, is not unique to Ireland, with the majority of advanced economies recording relatively high rates of price inflation in recent months.  That said, it is worth pointing out that this comes after several years of low inflation: the price level in Ireland is well below the level it would have been had inflation been in line with the ECB's price stability target of 2 per cent over the last two decades.</p><p>The recent rise in inflation is partly explained by global factors, including the recovery in oil prices following the pandemic-induced decline in prices last year, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between supply and demand in the markets for some goods and services following the re-opening of the economy.  Many of these factors are expected to fade over the course of next year.  </p><p>In its <i>Economic and Fiscal Outlook</i>, published alongside <i>Budget 2022</i>, my Department forecast a headline inflation rate of 2&frac14; per cent both for this year and for next.  A scenario analysis was also presented which showed the impact <i>inter alia</i>of higher energy prices on this projection.</p><p>The recent rise in wholesale energy prices means there is likely to be some upside to the projection for next year.  Nevertheless, the baseline projection that the rate of inflation eases over the course of next year remains valid; while persistently higher inflation cannot be ruled out, this is not the central assumption. </p><p>The Government has responded to higher inflation in a timely manner, with a range of measures introduced in <i>Budget 2022 </i>to protect households against increases in the cost of living.  </p><p>At a macro-level, these include a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. </p><p>At a micro-level, the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower-income households for higher energy costs as a result of the increase in the carbon tax. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. </p><p>Furthermore, following the recent rise in energy prices, the Cabinet this week approved an Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of up to &euro;100 in 2022 to an estimated 2.1m domestic electricity account holders. </p><p>In conclusion, the Government has responded to the mitigate the cost of living increases and my Department will continue to monitor inflationary developments closely.</p></reply>

It is important to note that LPT is a self-assessment tax and it is the responsibility of each owner to value his or her property. While Revenue provides extensive guidance to assist property owners with this process, it does not determine the value of any property for LPT purposes. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that LPT returns for the next &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; (2022 to 2025) have been filed and are fully up to date in respect of 1.4 million properties. Filing arrangements are being finalised in respect of a further 170,400 Local Authority and Approved Housing Body properties and there are open correspondence queries on hand with Revenue in respect of approximately 40,000 properties. While these queries delay filing, the liable persons are considered compliant. Revenue estimates that the return filing compliance rate is therefore approximately 80%. Furthermore, payment arrangements are in place for approximately 190,000 additional properties where returns are not yet filed, giving an estimated payment compliance rate of 90%.</p><p>While the return filing deadline passed on 10 November, it is evident that property owners are still making their best effort to file their returns as these continue to be received by Revenue. The due date for payment of 2022 LPT for those property owners who do not yet have a payment option in place is 12 January 2022.</p><p>To date, &euro;119m has been collected for LPT for 2022.  Overall new payment methods have been put in place to the value of &euro;390m, and annualised payment methods provide for the collection of a further &euro;47m. As outlined, returns are still being finalised so this is not the final position.  The total LPT collected to date in 2021, including monies due in respect of 2021, late payments for 2020 and early payments for 2022, is &euro;531 million. As requested by the Deputy LPT collections in 2016 to 2020 are shown in a table which will appear in the official record. This shows that the LPT collected in 2016 was &euro;463 million; in 2017 &euro;477 million; in 2018  &euro;483 million; in 2019 &euro;474 million and in 2020 &euro;482 million. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year of Collection</th>       <th>LPT Receipts &euro;m</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>482</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>474</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>483</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>477</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>463</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>While detailed analysis of the returns will take some time, Revenue publishes preliminary statistics on LPT on a regular basis on its website. </p></reply>

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. </p>  <p>   The EU Directive permits derogations from the general rules to allow an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments, such as the application of one of their reduced rates to particular goods and services which are not included in Annex III. Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive and standstill provisions from 1991 and cannot be reduced below 12%.</p></reply>

It acknowledged that the credit played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents but recommended that the credit should be allocated to the principal carer of the child only. </p>  <p>  The One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced by the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014. The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases that band to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more strategically targeted, in that it will in the first instance only be available to the principal carer of the child. </p>  <p>  The Single Person Child Carer Credit is available if you are the &lsquo;primary claimant&rsquo;. To be a primary claimant your qualifying child must live with you for the whole, or greater part, of the year (a period greater than 6 months). Ultimately, of course, the allocation of childcare responsibilities is primarily for parents or guardians to agree and a principal carer will be able to relinquish the credit in order than a non-principal carer can claim it.</p>  <p>  Issues concerning the Single Person Child Carer Credit are outlined in a review conducted by my Department in 2015, which is contained in the Report on Tax Expenditures, available at the following link: budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2016/Documents/Tax_Expenditures_Report_pub.pdf.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Single Person Child Carer Credit in its current form is targeting State resources to where they are most needed. As such, I have no plans to review or amend the Single Person Child Carer Credit at this time. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the increased cost of living I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Budget 2022 income tax and USC measures. This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700.  An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all earners was also announced. Further, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC will be increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC.

The Government is committed to holding insurers to account and ensuring that consumers experience the benefits from the range of measures being implemented under the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. As the Deputy will appreciate, consistent implementation of these Guidelines by insurers, PIAB and the Judiciary will be vital in achieving an improved claims environment.  </p>  <p>  The National Claims Information Database (NCID) is published by the Central Bank of Ireland. The NCID contains a wealth of data that can provide insights into developments within the insurance sector such as the cost of premiums; the cost and frequency of claims; the settlement of claims; the revenues and expenditures of firms, and the profitability of the sector. As the Deputy is aware, there is no comparable resource in the UK, or indeed any other EU market. As such, the NCID allows us to monitor the impact of any reduced costs that insurers incur on the cost of premiums. I believe this is more valuable than monitoring the impact of a single reform such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines, especially as there are multiple reforms being pursued under the Action Plan, which may also impact on the cost and availability of insurance.</p>  <p>  That said, following the publication of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, officials engaged with the Central Bank of Ireland to consider possible further enhancements to the NCID data specification.  In this regard, the Bank has outlined its intention to collect additional claim settlement data for all classes of business within the remit of the NCID so as to obtain further information on the impact of the Guidelines on claims settlement.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that it is still early days in terms of assessing the impact of the Guidelines, and any data available to date is preliminary in nature. Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that the latest CSO data, and the recently-published third NCID Report on Private Motor Insurance, both point to a continuing decline in the price of motor insurance. In time with consistent use of the Guidelines this should help to further bolster this downward trajectory, and the NCID will allow us to see whether this is the case. The NCID has already proven to be an excellent tool when it comes to increasing transparency regarding how the cost of claims impacts on the price of premiums. In light of the ongoing expansion that is planned, I believe that it remains the most effective measure to objectively monitor whether savings arising from the Personal Injuries Guidelines, as well as other reforms, are being reflected in premiums.</p></reply>

Furthermore, all taxpayers have rights of appeal under tax law against assessments to tax raised on them by Revenue. </p>  <p>  Regarding the agreement reached between the courier sector and Revenue in 1997, I am advised that the purpose of the arrangement was to ensure that motor bike and bicycle couriers that were engaged on a regular basis by courier businesses were assisted in relation to their tax compliance by having tax deductions made when they were paid for their services.  In order to participate in the scheme, the couriers in question had to be bona fide self-employed and as such there was no cost involved to the Exchequer. The courier companies that operated this &lsquo;voluntary PAYE&rsquo; scheme did so of their own volition and made the necessary remittances to Revenue based on the deductions from the payments they made to individual couriers.  </p>  <p>  From the courier&rsquo;s perspective, no additional costs arose because they participated in the scheme.  As they were self-employed, when they filed their annual income tax return at year end, they were given a credit for any tax deducted by the courier companies against their final tax liabilities for the year.  In addition, in recognition of the fact that couriers had to cover the costs of insurance, repairs, fuel etc. on their own vehicles, the agreement also provided for a flat deduction of 45% of the courier&rsquo;s gross annual turnover as expenses of their trade, such that tax only became payable on the balance of 55% of their turnover.  This aspect of the agreement was withdrawn at the start of 2019 when PAYE Modernisation was introduced.  In common with all other self-employed persons, couriers should now claim any expenses of their trade in their annual income tax return.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that the &lsquo;voluntary PAYE&rsquo; scheme operated by courier companies has all but ceased to exist, with 2 companies operating the scheme for 10 individual couriers in 2021 and that no similar arrangements exist, or have existed, for any other business sector.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it conducts a full range of compliance interventions to combat all types of tax evasion. Furthermore, Revenue compliance interventions include a focus on the practice of disguised employment and challenging the inappropriate classification of workers as self-employed contractors.  These interventions are conducted by Revenue acting alone or in collaboration with Department of Social Protection officers, who examine the PRSI status of individuals as part of such interventions as well as with officers from the Workplace Relations Commission, who are responsible for examining employee rights including sick leave and other entitlements. </p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied that Revenue has and will continue to administer the tax code fairly and in accordance with underlying law.  The agreement reached in 1997 between Revenue and the courier industry was a pragmatic approach to secure as much voluntary compliance from within the sector as possible.  The instances of the take-up of the scheme today has significantly reduced and Revenue has more administrative powers at its disposal to secure compliance from all commercial sectors than it did back in the 1990s when the agreement was made.</p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p><p>In monetary terms, the overall support provided to-date (9<sup>th</sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.6 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 696,900 employees.  </p><p>Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector. </p><p>However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped. The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the rate, as well as consideration of a higher weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainty around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the Omicron variant. </p><p>Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term. As such, the Government decided, and it was announced on Thursday last (9<sup>th</sup>December), that the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. </p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p><p>The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria. Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but is now being extended to the end of January 2022 under the same Government decision of 9 December as mentioned above.  Provision is also being made to allow me, as Minister for Finance, to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial Order if deemed necessary.</p><p>Amendments to the Finance Bill 2021 were brought forward this week to give effect to the EWSS and CRSS changes mentioned.</p><p>Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

I have chosen this rate as I believe great care needs to be taken to get the balance right between it achieving its essential purpose of encouraging the release of land for housebuilding purposes, but at the same time not being too penal, so that it runs the risk of being challenged in the courts. </p>  <p>  My fear is that if I were to apply a higher rate from the outset, it could change the economics of making a return on capital invested in the land as a business asset, and may make some businesses unviable. Such an approach I believe would be counterproductive and damaging to the goal of meeting the Government's house building objectives over the next number of years.</p>  <p>  In summary, I believe it is important to see how the tax operates and then make an assessment as to whether it is working. If it is not leading to an increase in land being released for housing purposes, I will have no hesitation in reviewing the rate, if I deem it likely that this will help the situation. </p></reply>

The rate changes provided for in the Finance Bill 2021 reinforce this progress by increasing the fiscal gap between low emission vehicles and the rest, thus incentivising motorists in the market for a new car to make &lsquo;greener choices&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Following the changes introduced last year there has been significant increases in electric vehicle registrations in 2021, mirrored by decreases in the number of high emission fossil fuel vehicles. The middle emissions bands (where most of the volume lies) have also experienced a shift towards lower emission vehicles. The average WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure) figure for vehicles new and used in 2020 was 135.6 gCO2/km (band 14). This has fallen to 122.6 g/km (band 11) to end July 2021. This is clear evidence that VRT reform is leading to lower emission cars on our roads. </p></reply>

We intend to issue proposals emanating from the Review of the Policy Framework for consultation shortly. </p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  </p><p><b>Review of Lending and Investment Regulations</b></p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks. Since 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further  capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As of June 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;372 million, an increase of 18% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that two credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the &euro;330m Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS is a successor to the Brexit Loan Scheme and provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. While its predecessor had been available through participating banks, the BILS will now also be available through participating credit unions, ensuring wider accessibility of the scheme.</p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 5.6% year on year to end June 2021.</p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit in Budget 2022. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in green retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must be approved by the Central Bank.  </p><p>66 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank will commence a public consultation shortly &ndash; seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review. </p></reply>

The value of the gift is calculated by reference to the difference between any consideration paid by the beneficiary for the use of the property and the &ldquo;best price obtainable in the open market&rdquo; for the use, occupation, or enjoyment of similar property for that year.  On foot of a recommendation to align the CAT code, I included a provision in Finance Bill 2021 (as initiated) to amend section 40 as it applies to the treatment of interest free (and low interest) loans.  </p>  <p>  Generally, the calculation of the best price obtainable in the open market for the use, occupation, or enjoyment of an asset is carried out by reference to the value of the gift received.  For example, where a person is given the free use of a house, the gift would be valued at what it would cost to rent an equivalent property on the open market.  In the case of the free use of money in the form of an interest-free or low interest loan, however, the Revenue practice to date has been to accept the current best financial institution deposit interest rate as the best price obtainable in the open market at the end of each year. As such, the value of these loans has been calculated by reference to the cost of making the gift, rather than the value of the gift received.  This is out of step with the way the value of the free use of other types of property is calculated for CAT purposes.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendment aimed to address this inconsistency by specifying that the annual value of an interest-free or low interest loan was to be calculated by reference to the best borrowing interest rate obtainable for the same sum. The intention was that a person in receipt of an interest-free or low interest loan would consult the published borrowing rates of the leading financial institutions in order to determine the best rate. </p>  <p>  However, while this approach may be in line with the treatment for the free use of other property, it does not take account of the nuances inherent in how financial institutions determine the appropriate interest rate as lenders. Therefore, it may prove difficult to apply in practice. For this reason, I decided to withdraw the amendment at D&aacute;il Committee Stage, to allow for further time and consideration to be given to the proposal. </p>  <p>  In relation to the recent publication of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) to which the Deputy has referred, this shows that almost 42% of first-time buyers, and almost 25% of mover purchasers, used gifts to help fund deposits needed to secure a mortgage to purchase a home. However, they said that the main source of deposits was from savings, with 96% of first-time buyers using savings to fund their deposits for mortgage loans. It is my understanding that the gifts the BPFI was referring to were in the form of outright gifts of money, rather than loans of money, i.e. there was no repayment aspect to these gifts, unlike with an interest-free or low interest loan. The Deputy should note that  it has always been the case that where the taxable value of a gift exceeds the relevant Group threshold, which would include gifts of money to buyers to help fund deposits, a CAT liability will arise. I have proposed no changes to the legislation in this regard.</p></reply>

Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity now exceeds the level immediately preceding the pandemic (2019-Q4) by around 3 per cent. Improvements can also be seen in the labour market with the unemployment rate including PUP recipients now below 7 per cent, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, early indications point towards an easing in growth rates in the domestic economy in the fourth quarter. Part of this is the continued adjustment in growth towards pre-pandemic trends with re-opening effects and pent-up demand tapering off. Clearly, any further deterioration in the current epidemiological situation that results in the re-introduction of significant restrictions would hamper the economic recovery. However, with our booster campaign ramping up, and nearly a third of those who are fully vaccinated having now received a third jab, I am confident that, once we overcome the fourth wave of the virus, our economy will strengthen. </p>  <p>  The rapid rebound in domestic economic activity however has also been accompanied by rising inflationary pressures. However, this recent rise in inflation is partly explained by global factors, many of which are expected to ease over time but may prove persistent.  Needless to say, significantly higher inflation next year would have significant impacts on the wider economy and public finances. My Department will therefore continue to monitor inflationary developments closely and respond as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Over the longer term, thanks to the strength of our economic model, including our well educated work force and pro-enterprise culture, I believe our economy will remain resilient to future economic shocks. However, we have borrowed heavily to provide support to the economy and minimise the negative effects of the pandemic. While such a counter-cyclical approach was both appropriate and necessary, the ongoing cost is significant. Going forward the Government will return our public finances to a more sustainable position, this will help us re-build our fiscal buffers and help us to withstand future economic shocks.</p></reply>

The National Remote Work Strategy aims to make remote work a permanent feature of the Irish working experience in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits. </p>  <p>  As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The TSG paper outlines the effects of Covid-19 on remote working in Ireland, provides an international comparison of remote working tax rules, sets out options for consideration with regard to enhancing the tax arrangements for both employers and employees in respect of remote work and evaluates those options in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The paper is published on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  In line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, on Budget Day, I announced that an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services in respect of those incurred while working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. This measure enhances and formalises existing arrangements that are currently operated by Revenue on an administrative basis and its legislative aspects are being provided for in Finance Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home and it will support living standards as the economy recovers.  </p>  <p>  Any amounts reimbursed or to be reimbursed, directly or indirectly to the remote worker in relation to the expenses of working from home by his or her employer should be deducted from the amount of relief being claimed.</p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s online system will enable individuals claim tax relief in real time as they pay for these costs throughout the year. The enhanced relief will apply for the year of assessment 2022 and subsequent years. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware Budget 2022 also included a substantial income tax package that will be of benefit to everyone who pays income tax and aims to help citizens when prices are rising. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Government recently approved the establishment of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme under which a payment of &euro;100 will be made to each domestic electricity customer as a once off measure to mitigate the effects of the unprecedented rise in electricity prices on domestic electricity customers. </p></reply>

This is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, requires the occupation of farmland. Agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farmland. The measure is specifically targeted at the farming sector to address the particular problems faced by family farms.   </p>  <p>  My officials met with contractors' representatives in December 2019 and advised that my Department was intending to schedule a review of the scheme (and related aspects) in the context of a wider report on agri-tax reliefs and the Government's Climate policy.</p>  <p>  The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the intervening period caused the review to be deferred and it has yet to take place. In the meantime, the status quo has remained in relation to the application and scope of section 664A. My Department is hopeful that the way will be clear for the promised review to be carried out, most likely in the first half of 2022. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel. </p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy will appreciate, decisions regarding taxation measures are made having regard to the annual Budget and Finance Bill processes, the sound management of the public finances and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. Furthermore, I must also have regard to ensuring that any tax measures are consistent with the need to meet our Climate Action Plan targets.</p></reply>

I note that Ulster Bank expects c. 280 staff wholly or mainly assigned to this loan book to transfer also. </p><p>- On 23 July, Ulster Bank reached a non-binding agreement with PTSB for the proposed sale of &euro;7.6bn performing loans, Ulster Bank&rsquo;s Lombard Asset Finance business, and 25 Ulster Bank branch locations. I note that if this potential transaction is delivered, it is expected that between 400 and 500 Ulster Bank employees will transfer to PTSB.</p><p>At the end of October it was also helpful to see Ulster Bank signposting the next step in its closure  by encouraging customers to begin considering their options, availing of supports and getting ready to choose a new banking provider. I note that Ulster Bank does not anticipate closing any branches in the first half of 2022 and will begin to phase out traditional counter/ cash services to concentrate on in-person support for customers to move bank and/ or close accounts in the second half of the year. </p><p>In terms of regulatory requirements, Provision 3.11 of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 applies. This requires that a regulated entity that intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated entity must:</p><p>- provide affected consumers with at least two months&rsquo; notice to enable them to make alternative arrangements if they so wish;</p><p>- ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to any transfer, merger or cessation of operations; or, in the case of a transfer or merger, inform customers as to how continuity of service will be provided following a transfer or merger; and</p><p>- in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform customers that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of any bank that withdraws from the market will be focused on ensuring that its customers are treated fairly, and that the bank remains in<b></b>compliance with the letter and spirit of regulatory requirements. </p></reply>

The internationally-agreed minimum effective tax rate is 15%.</p><p>To ensure consistency in the application of the rules internationally to calculate effective tax rates, as a first step the GloBE rules set out a common basis for measuring profits. The starting point for measuring profits for GloBE purposes is to take the financial accounting information for the companies concerned, subject to certain agreed adjustments. This is the case whether the companies in question are in Ireland or anywhere else in the world.</p><p>The second step in calculating the effective tax rate is to work out the amount of tax to be matched against the profits. Again, the tax figure is taken from financial accounting information, subject to certain agreed adjustments. The use of financial accounting information in both steps sets out a robust process for calculating effective tax rates.</p><p>The report which is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (&ldquo;<i>Section 291A</i>&rdquo;). Section 291A provides for allowances in respect of capital expenditure on the acquisition of certain intangible assets, referred to as <i>specified intangible assets</i>. Section 291A claims that are based on the amortisation or impairment charge, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, in the company accounts will align with the GloBE rules of Pillar Two. Where the Section 291A claim exceeds the amount of such charge in the company accounts, the GloBE rules will intervene to limit any deduction, for minimum tax purposes, to the charge in the accounts&mdash; unless the excess is attributable to a short-term timing difference that will subsequently reverse in the company&rsquo;s accounts. Section 291A allowances are made in respect of real expenditure reflected in the financial accounts and are not unique to Ireland.</p><p>The report in question also refers to the so-called <i>double Irish</i>structure. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland has made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specifically designed to prevent such structures. Since 1 January this year, following a transitional period, the changes concerned have come into full effect.</p></reply>

With regard to applications for life insurance, it is my understanding that generally, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. These can include age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p>  <p>  My officials have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland about accessing life insurance for individuals with medical conditions. According to Insurance Ireland, it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants. It stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors. In this regard, I understand that applicants are asked questions about various conditions in order for insurers to assess the risk involved, and that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria. If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.</p>  <p>  It may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu. Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p></reply>

Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits whatever arising from an office or employment. Therefore, all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with section 112. I have no plans to change this position. </p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.  However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities. It will prohibit the practice of using tips or gratuities to top up wages. It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff. As well as this, it will provide transparency to customers so they will know what the policy is on tips and service charges, how they are managed and to whom they go.

Road transport is a sector earmarked for radical decarbonisation, and motor vehicle taxation is an important policy lever in achieving these goals. A significant uptake in electric vehicles (EVs) forms a key part of targets on emissions reductions from road transport, and the motor tax system reflects this ambition. The rates structure increases progressively according to the emissions profile of a vehicle; EVs are therefore liable to motor tax at the lowest rate. As the national fleet becomes increasingly electrified this will lead to a decline in motor tax revenue, and as such the regime is kept under constant review. The future of vehicle and road taxation has been assessed in previous tax strategy group papers and work will continue in this area. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, the Commission of Taxation and Welfare has been established to independently consider how the taxation and welfare systems can be used to support economic activity, stimulate employment and prosperity, and provide for the costs of public services and supports. The Commission&rsquo;s terms of references specify that it will &ldquo;examine how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low carbon economy as part of the process of meeting its climate change commitments as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.

This key strategy, known as the Ireland for Finance Strategy is a multi-year strategy with published annual action plans which monitor progress and highlight specific goals for the coming year. By way of background, the use of innovative technology to deliver financial services is also known as 'fintech' (a combination of the words 'financial' and 'technology') and the use of innovative technology to deliver certain sectoral financial services like insurance is know as 'insurtech'.</p><p>Insurance Ireland have led on actions in successive Action Plans under the Ireland for Finance strategy to develop an insurtech hub in Ireland and considerable progress has been made on this initiative in 2021. </p><p>Insurance Ireland commissioned a study to assess feasibility and benchmark against international best practice and this study was completed in April 2021. Insurance Ireland have since developed a comprehensive Insurtech Strategy and have set up the InsTech.ie hub to bring this strategy forward. </p><p>I understand that the objectives of creating this hub include: </p><p>- facilitating connections for members</p><p>- developing a database of local and international exemplars </p><p>- pairing firms with curated Start-ups </p><p>- events &ndash; access global best practice </p><p>- promoting Ireland as an Innovation hub </p><p>- preparing talent / skills for the future </p><p>- collaborating with policymakers on innovation. </p><p>The Insurance Ireland Working Group reached out to external bodies and members to assess the appetite to become part of the group and 12 founding members have joined forces to promote the country as an EU hub for the growing insurtech industry.</p><p>Instech.ie was officially launched by the 12 founding members in July 2021 and in November of this year, they appointed a CEO of Instech.ie. </p><p>Finally, Minister of State Fleming and departmental officials have also engaged with a range of other stakeholders across the insurtech sector to review the potential impact on competition and availability of insurance, and will continue to monitor developments in this space as they occur. Work is at an early stage but we will continue to be active in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

This measure is a part of the &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; Strategy published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September 2021.</p>  <p>  The Residential Zoned Land Tax is designed to prompt residential development by owners of land that is zoned for residential or mixed use purposes and that is serviced, and its primary objective is to increase the supply of housing rather than to raise revenue.</p>  <p>  The Residential Zoned Land Tax is an annual tax, calculated at 3% of the market value of the land. The legislation provides that each local authority will prepare and publish a map identifying land within the scope of the tax.  These maps will be updated annually for changes in zoning and servicing of the land. Landowners will have an opportunity to submit an appeal against inclusion on the map to the local authority in the first instance, and subsequently to An Bord Plean&aacute;la where the local authority upholds their original decision.</p>  <p>  A number of exclusions from the scope of the tax have been provided for, including existing habitable</p>  <p>  dwellings and the curtilage, certain infrastructure or facilities, a site which is designated as a derelict site and liable for the Derelict Sites Levy, land zoned residential but used by a business to provide services consistent with a residential area, and  land in an area zoned for a mixture of uses, where it is used for business purposes - in other words it is not deemed to be vacant or idle.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question regarding a timeline for the rollout of the measure, an owner who has land which was zoned and serviced on 1 January 2022, and who has not commenced development of the land before 1 February 2024, will be subject to a charge which will be due and payable in May 2024.  Where the land is zoned or serviced after 1 January 2022, tax will be chargeable in the third year after it comes within scope.</p>  <p>  The Residential Zoned Land Tax will operate on a self-assessment basis and will be administered by the Revenue Commissioner. The legislation requires landowners to maintain detailed records so that the Revenue Commissioner may verify tax payable as well as claims for exemption, abatement or deferral of the tax. </p></reply>

This year we have seen a number of announcements from the main retail banks in relation to their operations in the state and their branch networks around the country. While decisions relating to the business model of regulated firms are a commercial matter for the boards of those firms, the Central Bank and I expect them to take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers. </p>  <p>  Under Provision 3.12 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code), any bank that intends to close, merge or move a branch must: </p>  <p>  1. notify the Central Bank immediately;</p>  <p>  2. provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements; </p>  <p>  3. ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to its closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and </p>  <p>  4. notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance</p>  <p>  Once notified, the Central Bank engages with the regulated entity to ensure the impact of the decision has been carefully considered across its full customer base and at the appropriate levels. The Central Bank expects entities to provide affected vulnerable customers with the assistance necessary to ensure that those customers can retain full access to basic financial services, albeit in many cases at another branch location.</p>  <p>  The changes currently taking place in the Irish retail banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the banking sector is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad. It is because of these changes that I have instructed my Department to undertake a broad-ranging review of the retail banking sector. </p>  <p>  The Retail Banking Review has commenced its work and is currently in its research phase and is developing its project plan. It will be undertaking a survey of consumers in the coming months to ascertain their experience and perceptions of the retail banking sector in Ireland. The survey sample will include consumers in rural areas. </p>  <p>  There will also be a public consultation process in 2022 where members of the public can make a submission to the Department of Finance on issues that fall within the Terms of Reference. In advance of the Public consultation the Review team will contact a wide range of stakeholders to draw their attention to the Review and to tell them that the Review team is happy to receive submissions on issues that fall within the Terms of Reference at any time at bankingreview@finance.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered by the Review as part of its work assessing the current landscape for the provision of retail banking services in Ireland and its likely evolution over the coming years. The team will also look at the size and structure of the sector in Ireland and in similar size open economies in the EU and the OECD to see what lessons can be learned from initiatives and practices in those jurisdictions. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.356.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600057#WRF06900"><p>The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) is designed to help reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad, to take up positions in the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland. The scheme currently has a sunset date of 31 December 2022.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy is based on export-led growth. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been and continues to be an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development. SARP is part of our FDI policy which allows our country to be competitive and attract certain senior decision-makers here to particular companies. This is fundamental to the creation and retention of other jobs. </p><p>The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives. The competition for this talent is intense, particularly for the types of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland. If we cease this scheme, it makes what we offer uncompetitive versus the offerings from competitor jurisdictions, for example France, Portugal, the Netherlands and Italy &ndash; to name but a few.</p><p>The existence of similar (and indeed more attractive) special assignee type tax reliefs in competitor jurisdictions creates a market failure that would not be addressed, but for the continued existence of SARP.</p><p>On Budget Day, the annual Revenue report on SARP for 2019 was published. It found a significant reversal in the overall cost of the scheme in 2019 (&euro;38.2m) as compared with 2018 when the cost was &euro;42.4m. This is attributable at least in part, to my decision to introduce a salary cap of &euro;1m on the amount of a person's income that can benefit from the scheme in Finance Act 2018. The change applied from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and from 1 January 2020 for existing recipients.</p><p>Furthermore, the aggregate number of jobs that were reported as created and retained as a result of the scheme has increased since 2018. There were 379 additional employees compared with 236 in 2018 and the number of employees retained was 483, compared with 348 in 2018. This combined total of 862 SARP-related jobs in 2019 represents a cost of &euro;44,000 per job created or retained, a decrease in cost per job compared with 2018, when there were 584 SARP supported jobs at an average cost of &euro;73,000 each. This represents a decrease in cost of over 39%. </p><p>The benefits of SARP, aside from enhancing our international competitiveness, are detailed clearly in the Indecon report and they include:</p><p>- Increased employment and retention of staff within SARP companies;</p><p>- Associated additional investment in the economy of the order of &euro;25 million;</p><p>- Additional Corporation Tax receipts;</p><p>- Additional PAYE receipts; and</p><p>- R&amp;amp;D spill-over activity. </p><p>In 2019, I commissioned an independent review of the scheme. The report of the review confirmed to me the strong policy rationale for the continued relevance of SARP to the Irish economy. The report is available on the Department of Finance website.</p><p>The review highlights the following data regarding companies that availed of SARP for the year 2017:</p><p>- they paid over &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax;</p><p>- they employed over 155,00 individuals; and,</p><p>- they paid over &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes.</p><p>I recognise that there is, of course, a balance to be struck between the principle of horizontal equity within the tax system and the need to compete internationally for highly skilled and mobile personnel. In this regard, and in order to seek to ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained, the issue is kept under regular review through detailed examinations of the type carried out by Indecon in 2019. As the scheme sunsets next year, there will be a further opportunity for review.</p></reply>

However, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific businesses or individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive framework.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government keenly understands that access to affordable insurance is vital for businesses, and is therefore working to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial service through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. This reform agenda is progressing well, with the first Implementation Report published last July showing that 34 of the 66 actions were complete.</p>  <p>  One of the key achievements to date has been the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule, which should provide much greater certainty regarding award levels, in addition to reducing awards for many common injuries. These should also lead to lower legal fees by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to settle claims. The overall impact should therefore be to lower claims costs for insurers. In turn, it is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that insurers will reflect any savings by reducing customers&rsquo; premiums.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming recently met with the CEOs of the main insurers here to assess their response to the Guidelines, and to emphasise the importance of insurers not undermining the Guidelines by settling for amounts that are inconsistent with them. I understand that this engagement was positive, and that insurers confirmed that they are committed to passing on savings from the Guidelines, and are adhering to them in their direct settlements.</p>  <p>  In addition to lowering premiums, it is hoped that consistent use of the Guidelines will result in a more stable claims environment that will encourage existing insurers to expand their risk appetite, and help to attract new entrants into the Irish market. Work being undertaken by the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market to attract new providers here, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, will seek to leverage this. In his recent meetings, Minister of State Fleming also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, work to complete outstanding reforms under the Action Plan remains ongoing. Upcoming priorities of particular note with regard to the childcare sector and high footfall industries include changes to the duty of care, which the Minister for Justice is leading on. It is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the overall implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors of the economy, including childcare.</p></reply>

This is a tangible demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving a Just Transition. </p>  <p>  I would like to remind people that there are still very significant savings to be had by shopping around energy suppliers.    I would also note that the most effective way to reduce a household&rsquo;s energy bills permanently is through improving the energy efficiency of their home. The Government is providing a record level of support for energy efficiency this year. This will continue in 2022 with further investment. </p>  <p>  In the long run, the best way to protect Ireland from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them. We will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p></reply>

The CCPC is the statutory body responsible for promoting compliance with, and enforcing, competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. It provides a number of very useful online comparison tools for various financial products on its consumer website to help consumers manage their money.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also conducted research and brought forward regulation in recent years to ensure lenders are not putting impediments in place to prevent switching.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the Central Bank of Ireland issued a Code of Conduct on the Switching of Payment Accounts with Payment Service Providers (the Switching Code). All banks, payment institutions and e-money institutions that offer payment accounts in Ireland must comply with the Code. The Switching Code is designed to ensure switching accounts is easy straightforward for the consumer. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank continues to analyse key trends in relation to switching. In 2019, it released a Consumer Protection Bulletin which analyses the level of current account switching using data gathered from credit institutions and provides a high-level overview of the number and value of current accounts held by personal consumers, the number of consumers using the Switching Code and the number of consumer complaints received by firms in relation to current accounts.</p>  <p>  Separately, in relation to mortgage switching the Central Bank produced an Addendum to its Consumer Protection Code in relation to mortgage switching in June 2018, following a public consultation process. </p>  <p>  My Department, for its part, has also been doing considerable work to encourage consumer switching. Following on from the successful delivery of two advertising campaigns which promoted awareness on the benefits of switching, the Department of Finance is now working on the third phase of the Switch your bank campaign. This phase seeks to identify and develop tools which will better enable consumers to complete their switches and the Economic and Social Research Institute&rsquo;s (ESRI) Behavioural Research Unit has been contracted to carry out an experimental research project that will focus on the behavioural aspects of switching. </p>  <p>  The campaign will continue to be supported by a dedicated website, www.switchyourbank.ie/ which provides a single source where consumers can access useful facts about switching, including a straightforward step by step guide, links to Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) comparison tools and helpful information to support their decision-making.</p></reply>

The emergence of inflationary pressures in recent months is not unique to Ireland however, with inflation hitting multi-decade highs of 6.8 and 4.9 per cent in the US and euro area respectively in November.</p>  <p>  The recent increase in inflation is partly explained by global factors, which are expected to ease over time. These include &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; of oil prices following their collapse last spring, the recent rise in wholesale energy prices and the imbalance between supply and demand that has emerged following the re-opening of the economy. This has been compounded by global supply chain disruptions, including transport bottlenecks, input shortages (e.g. semi-conductors) as well as labour supply shortages in some sectors. </p>  <p>  At the time of the Budget, the Department forecast inflation of 2&frac14; per cent for this year and next year. Despite the strong pick-up in the rate of inflation in recent months, the rate for 2021 as a whole is likely to be close to the Department&rsquo;s projection. However, the recent spike in wholesale energy prices means there is likely to be upside to the projection for next year. Nevertheless, inflation is still expected to ease over the course of next year as some of these factors fade, demand stabilises and supply catches up. However, the possibility of persistently higher inflation cannot be ruled out. Additionally, the recent emergence of the Omicron variant means there is now greater uncertainty about the inflation outlook.</p>  <p>  Needless to say, significantly higher inflation next year would have significant impacts on the wider economy and public finances. At the household level real incomes could be squeezed, while at the firm level higher input costs would affect competitiveness. Meanwhile persistently higher inflation could trigger higher interest rates (including a policy response by the ECB), which would have implications for Government financing costs as well as for mortgage interest costs. In light of these risks, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments over the coming months. </p></reply>

Inflationary pressures are not unique to Ireland however, with multi-decade high inflation rates of 6.8 and 4.9 per cent recorded in the US and euro area in November. However, this comes after years of inflation of around 1 per cent, with the price level in Ireland still well below the level it would have been had the inflation rate been in line with the ECB price stability target of 2 per cent over the last two decades.</p>  <p>  The recent rise in inflation is partly explained by global factors, which are expected to ease over time, including oil price &lsquo;base effects&rsquo;, global supply chain disruptions and the imbalance between supply and demand that has emerged following re-opening. More recently, rising wholesale energy prices have added to inflationary pressures, with energy inflation of 28 per cent recorded in November. However, futures markets point to an easing in energy inflation next year.</p>  <p>  At the time of the Budget, my Department forecast headline inflation of 2&frac14; per cent for this year and next, however, the recent rise in wholesale energy prices means there is likely to be upside to the projection for next year. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to ease over the course of next year as these factors fade, demand stabilises and supply catches up. However, the possibility of persistently higher inflation cannot be ruled out. </p>  <p>  The Government is however, very conscious of the impact of current inflationary pressures and introduced a range of measures in Budget 2022 to protect households against increases in the cost of living. These include a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. The fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower-income households for higher energy costs as a result of the increase in the carbon tax. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. Nonetheless, my Department will continue to monitor inflationary developments closely and respond as appropriate.</p></reply>

The threshold that will apply to the 15 per cent minimum effective tax rate is &euro;750 million annual global turnover. Thus, the vast majority of companies in Ireland - over 95 per cent - will not be subject to these new rules, and will continue to be subject to corporation tax at a headline rate of 12.5 per cent. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners previously estimated that the cost of the OECD agreement on a new tax framework to address the tax challenges of digitalisation could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. However, as I have stated many times, this is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. Although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.</p>  <p>  At a superficial level, the application of a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent under Pillar Two could provide some uplift to domestic corporation tax revenues. However, this would be a static assumption which does not take account of how firms react to a new tax regime, or to potential changes in tax regimes in other jurisdictions i.e. changes to the tax base. Further, any uplift on Pillar Two would be countered by the potential cost of Pillar One. That cost remains highly uncertain as its technical implementation is still far from resolved.</p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that what we have now is a broad high level agreement on the main features of a solution. Discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the agreement will be implemented in practice. As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances.</p></reply>

My Department does not have any additional or more detailed information on this specific data.</p>  <p>  However, more generally the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) has indicated that financial institutions always seek to ensure the right outcome for the customer by taking all aspects of the specific mortgage application into consideration and, in reviewing any case where an exemption to the requirement to arrange mortgage protection insurance is sought, lenders will engage closely with each customer on a case-by-case basis to understand the credit and other risks which may arise in each individual case. Of most concern in such cases is understanding if any surviving party to the mortgage would have the ability to repay the facility in the event of the death of the uninsured party. There are situations where it is deemed in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement and others where it is deemed not to be in the customer&rsquo;s best interest to waive the requirement for mortgage protection. This is likely to be particularly relevant where the mortgage is on the family home or the primary residence of the customer. Also it should be noted that, as customers typically arrange mortgage protection insurance through a third-party insurance company, lenders are often unaware of the specific reasons why the third-party insurance company has declined mortgage protection cover and therefore this is not a factor included in consideration when deciding on a waiver request.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it should also be noted that if any person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider or insurance provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or mortgage protection insurance, the consumer can complain directly to the regulated entity. If they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman who, if a valid complaint is made, will independently consider the matter. </p></reply>

Section 96(2A) of Finance Act 1999 provides that &ldquo;substitute fuels&rdquo; are also subject to MOT; substitute fuels are liquid products, other than mineral oils, that are used as motor or heating fuels. Under the Act, a substitute fuel is taxed at the MOT rate of the mineral oil in whose place it is used. For example, a substitute fuel used in place of diesel in a motor vehicle would be taxed at the MOT rate for auto-diesel, currently &euro;535.46 per 1,000 litres, which comprises carbon and non-carbon components of &euro;109.74 and &euro;425.72 per 1,000 litres respectively.</p>  <p>  MOT law provides for a relief from the carbon component of MOT for biofuels that are made of biomass of animal or vegetal origin. This means that a substitute fuel that is entirely made from biomass would be liable for the non-carbon component of MOT only. In the case of such a biofuel used in place of diesel, the MOT carbon component of &euro;109.74 per 1,000 litres would be fully relieved and the applicable MOT rate would be &euro;425.72 per 1,000 litres. For blended fuels containing biomass, the relief applies to the portion of fuel that meets the biofuel criteria set out in MOT legislation. The biofuel relief is intended to promote a higher level of biofuel in conventional transport fuel sales and supports Government&rsquo;s commitment to incentivising the use of greener alternatives to fossil fuels. </p>  <p>  Because the carbon component of MOT is already fully relieved for biofuels, these types of fuels are not impacted by the ten-year trajectory of carbon tax increases which I introduced in Finance Act 2020. This means that, as annual increases in the carbon component of MOT are implemented, the differential in tax costs between biofuels and fossil fuels will continue to widen, further incentivising the uptake of biofuels.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also wish to note that I introduced a Report Stage amendment to the Finance Bill 2021 so as to provide for a temporary reduction in the non-carbon component of MOT with effect from 1 April next year until Budget Day 2022. I have taken this step to partially offset the expected increase in fuel costs arising from an increase in the Biofuel Obligation for transport fuels proposed by my colleague the Minister for Transport. The reduction in MOT of 1 cent per litre (inclusive of VAT) will be matched by a reduction in the National Oil Reserves Agency levy, which together will offset the estimated impact of the biofuels increase on the retail price of auto fuels.</p></reply>

The price of fuel on the forecourt is set by the individual retailer and would likely take into account the costs associated with the retail of the product such as those mentioned above together with the cost of having oil delivered.</p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  Despite the postponement of the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members will continue to engage in a solution-oriented manner to find an outcome on how the WTO can contribute to an effective response to any pandemic, not just the current one.</p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions including discussions on how the flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  The global production of vaccines is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that 12 billion doses of COVID vaccines will be produced by the end of 2021. The EU considers that the COVAX Facility is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  Team Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland has contributed &euro;7 million in funding to COVAX in 2021 and will donate 3 million vaccines this year to low-income countries as part of the COVAX programme.  The first 500,000 Irish doses donated through the facility reached Nigeria on the 29 November. 112,800 vaccines arrived in Indonesia on 11 December and a bilateral donation of over 335,000 vaccines was made to Uganda in September.  A further consignment of 122,400 vaccines to Indonesia and 276,000 to Ghana are expected in the coming days. </p></reply>

Thus, in any one year the Health and Safety Authority carries out a lower level of inspections in the food sector compared to the construction or farming sectors where workplace fatalities and accidents are considerable higher.</p><p>Appendix 1 <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>No. of Accidents</th>       <th>% of Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>20.99%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>16.85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>13.26%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>8.29%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>4.70%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>4.42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>3.87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>3.87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>3.31%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>2.76%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>2.76%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2.21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2.21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1.93%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1.66%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1.38%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1.38%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1.38%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1.38%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0.83%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.28%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.28%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>362</td>       <td>100.00%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Appendix 2 <table>    <tr>       <th>What Triggered</th>       <th>No. of Accidents</th>       <th>% of Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lifting, carrying</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>18.23%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other triggers not listed</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>16.30%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pushing, pulling</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>14.64%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fall on same level (slip, stumble etc)</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>12.71%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss of control of hand held tool</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>8.56%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Twisting, turning</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>6.08%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss of control of object being worked on</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>5.25%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Body movement (no physical stress)</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>3.59%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Breakage of material at joints</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>3.04%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fall from height</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>2.76%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss of control of machine</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>2.76%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss of control of means of transport or handling equipment</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>2.21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss of control of animal</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1.66%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overflow, leakage, emission of gas</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1.10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overflow, leakage, emission of liquid</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>0.83%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Person in inappropriate area</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0.28%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>362</td>       <td>100.00%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Around 2.1 million homes will benefit from the scheme for a one-off, exceptional credit payment to their electricity accounts. The payment will be automatic and will applied directly to the bills of each domestic electricity account holder by their electricity supplier. People will not need to apply for the payment.</p>  <p>  The Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will be charged with oversight of the scheme. The scheme will be operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) by virtue of its existing interface with all electricity suppliers. ESB Networks will make payments to energy suppliers who in turn will credit all their domestic electricity account holders in the amount of &euro;100. The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts, including prepay meters. Further details of the Scheme including FAQ&rsquo;s will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</p>  <p>  The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching or engaging with energy suppliers. Many households could save on their bills if they did so. As recently as the 9th December, switching supplier could save a customer, consuming the average amount of electricity, up to &euro;313.</p></reply>

The submissions are now being considered in preparation of a formal response early next year.</p>  <p>  Ireland's ambitious offshore target of 5GW by 2030 will require investment of billions of euro in Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy sector, which will deliver considerable benefits to coastal communities in terms of high-value jobs, and indigenous supply chains. The significant role for regional ports in development of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy sector, and the need for investment in port infrastructure, will also benefit local coastal communities through employment and commercial opportunities.</p>  <p>  A medium-size offshore windpark now entails installed capacity of circa 500MW and a corresponding capital expenditure of over &euro;1.5 billion, accordingly to the latest estimates provided by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  It is proposed that the RESS auction for offshore would mandate a community benefit fund payment of &euro;2 for every MW/hour of energy generated.  Given the anticipated high levels of offshore generating potential, this will ensure multi-million Euro contributions per offshore project, per annum, to offshore communities over the entire duration of the project.</p>  <p>  Local communities are central to the decision-making processes of community engagement initiatives as part of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy commitments under the Climate Action Plan.  In order to ensure the highest levels of good governance and administration of the community benefit funds, guidance will be provided to local communities, stakeholders such as local fishers and the offshore industry itself to encourage and facilitate good design of local benefit schemes.</p></reply>

This will allow all renewables self-consumers, including farmers, to receive remuneration from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity exported to the grid, reflective of the market value of that electricity.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG on 1 December last. This decision, inter alia, outlines eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. The CEG will become available upon the transposition of Article 21 of RED II into Irish law, which is expected to be complete before year end, and will be available to both new and existing micro- and small-scale generators who fulfil the eligibility criteria as determined by the CRU.</p><p>My Department is also developing the final scheme design for the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS). It is expected that a proposal on the supports to be offered for new installations under the Scheme, including for farms, will be finalised shortly. Following Government approval, it is expected that the scheme design will be published in early 2022 and supports will be introduced on a phased basis during the year.  </p><p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators, i.e. above 50kW but smaller than those supported by the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, which will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023.</p></reply>

Government investment in County Mayo under the NBP will be in the order of &euro;145 million. </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 7 December, over 10,000 premises in County Mayo have been surveyed. Surveys are complete in areas around Castlebar, Ballina, Newport and Carrowmorelacken. Surveys are ongoing in the areas around Killadoon. I am advised that the following represents the deployment progress in County Mayo as of 7 December. <table>    <tr>       <th>Mayo &ndash; Surveys Complete</th>       <th>Mayo &ndash; Surveys Ongoing</th>       <th>Anticipated dates for premises to be passed and available for connection</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8,281 premises have been surveyed in Mayo including; </td>       <td>Areas around Killadoon (1053)</td>       <td>Castlebar H1, 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlebar (2139)</td>       <td></td>       <td>Ballina H2, 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballina (2678)</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Newport (1826)</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carrowmorelacken (1638)</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> I am further advised that pre build works are ongoing in the Deployment Area of Athlone in which 2,100 premises are located in County Mayo.</p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. </p><p>My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract which addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This plan rebaselines milestones for 2021 and work is currently underway to rebaseline milestones for 2022. Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December 2021, 424 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.  BCP&rsquo;s are installed in County Mayo at Clare Island Community Centre, Finny Community Centre, Islandeady Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Bofeenaun Community Centre, Clogher Community Centre, Ardagh Community Centre, Cushlough Community Centre, Belderrig Community &amp;amp; Research Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Keel Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, The Black Tom Freeman Sport and Community Amenities Centre and Clg B&eacute;al An Mhuirthead. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p><p>Scoil N&eacute;ifinn, Midfield National School, Meelick More National School, Kinaffe National School, Gortskehy National School, Facefield National School, Errew National School, Cloghans National School, Shraigh National School, Rathbane National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dooagh National School, Valley National School, Dookinella National School, Roxboro National School, Cloonliffen National School, Tavraun Central National School and Saint Coleman's National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced late last year which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

In compliance with State aid rules, funding on an exceptional basis was provided to Shannon Heritage at the end of December last to cover the incremental costs incurred to keep heritage sites open during the winter of 2020.  This funding is in addition to funding provided to Shannon Heritage under F&aacute;ilte Ireland's COVID Adaptation Grant Programme; the economy-wide supports Government has put in place including the TWSS/EWSS; and the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  </p>  <p>  The operation and management of Shannon Heritage sites is an operational matter for Shannon Heritage and Shannon Group plc. As a commercial State Body it is the responsibility of the Group to operate and manage the Shannon Heritage business in accordance with its commercial mandate. Shannon Group has advised that it is not financially viable to keep the heritage sites open in line with its pre-COVID-19 operating model given the lack of international visitors and the losses incurred as a result of that.  However, while Shannon Group had planned to close Bunratty and King John's Castles following the Christmas period until Easter, the decision by the Government to continue the EWSS into next year has allowed the Group to decide to keep the heritage sites open in the new year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Shannon Group is currently engaging with the relevant Local Authorities with a view to the transfer to them of the Shannon Heritage sites. My Department continues to engage with Shannon Group on this matter and I have been informed that discussions between the parties are progressing well and that the required due diligence exercises are underway. This due diligence must be concluded before the relevant Ministerial consents can be given to execute any transfer of the sites, with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I understand that while Shannon Group had planned for this work to be complete by the end of the year, the complexities involved in the transfer of the business and the due diligence required mean that it will be next year before the transfer of the sites can be completed. </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority is responsible for the day-to-day operations of public transport in conjunction with the public transport operators.  </p><p>The Regulations for the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport were introduced under Health legislation on 10 July and came into effect on Monday 13 July 2020, and were recently extended to February 2022. These Regulations require passengers, with some exceptions, to wear face coverings while utilising public transport and gives additional protection to both passengers and transport staff.</p><p>The Regulations are implementable by a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; who is defined as any officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the NTA.  A relevant person implementing the Regulations can seek the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where needed.  Where a passenger is not wearing a face covering, a relevant person under the Regulations may:</p><p>- request the passenger to wear a face covering;</p><p>- refuse the passenger entry to the public transport vehicle; or</p><p>- request the passenger to alight from the vehicle.</p><p>Failure to comply is an offence and there are penalties (on summary conviction) for non-compliance. </p><p>Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces, but that they not suitable for every individual.  Recognising this, the Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13.  On a temporary basis, subject to review in mid-February 2022, the wearing of face masks/coverings will be recommended for children:</p><p>- aged 9 years and over on public transport, in retail and other indoor public settings as currently required for those aged 13 and over, with exemptions as appropriate.</p><p>Reflecting public health advice, the Regulations also allow that wearing a face covering is not required where a person has a &ldquo;reasonable excuse&quot;.</p><p>People understand the importance of protecting their fellow passengers and the staff of the public transport operators.  It is not intended that enforcement or penalties will be needed often, but they are available if necessary.  The NTA is engaging regularly with public transport operators regarding implementation of the Regulations, and monitoring compliance levels across the network. </p><p>My Department and the NTA take the safety of both passengers and transport workers very seriously, and are continuing to monitor the effects of the measures in place very closely, in conjunction with public transport operators.</p></reply>

The revised Strategy does propose extending DART services beyond Maynooth; however, any such extension is a separate project to the recently approved DART+ West. </p><p>The Deputy may recall, in addition to the DART+ Fleet project, Government had previously approved purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars.

The beneficiary must also be an active farmer or lease the land to one. Agricultural Relief has been available for gift and inheritance tax since the introduction of Capital Acquisitions Tax in 1976. </p>  <p>  I recognise that CAT Agricultural Relief  is a key relief in ensuring the inter-generational transfer of farm assets and farm succession planning, and I have no plans to amend it at this time.</p></reply>

This relief provides a full relief from stamp duty on transfers of agricultural land (including farmhouses and buildings) for qualifying farmers. </p>  <p>  This measure, designed to support young farmers, is an EU State aid which is granted in accordance with the Agricultural Block Exemption Regulation, or ABER. The current ABER is due to expire on the 31st of December 2022. Therefore, to comply with EU State aid rules, I could only announce an extension of the relief until that date. The same applies in relation to stock relief for young trained farmers and farm partnerships. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Department of Agriculture that they are confident that reliefs of this nature will continue to be considered an acceptable form of State aid under the terms of any revised regulation.

Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.  HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.  </p>  <p>  In my Budget 2022 address, I announced an extension of HTB for a further year until the end of 2022 and also that a formal review of the scheme would take place in 2022. The intention is that the review will be fundamental in nature, and that it will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022.</p>  <p>  With regard to currently uninhabitable or derelict properties which are not to be demolished, the recent Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper on HTB, published on Budget day and available on my Department's website, noted that there would be difficulties in defining these properties in legislation to remove the potential for abuse. Revenue has advised that, as matters stand, in some marginal cases involving this issue for both HTB and Local Property Tax, a higher degree of compliance oversight, requiring engineers&rsquo; reports, photos and other supporting documentation, by them is necessary.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the paper notes that the extension of HTB as such a measure could create a market for eligible properties that would result in the benefit accruing to vendors of such properties in the form of increased prices rather than assisting purchasers. </p>  <p>  In relation to second-hand properties more generally, an increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. As mentioned above, the HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.  </p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (9<sup>th</sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.6 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 696,900 employees.  </p><p>Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector. </p><p>However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped.  The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the rate, as well as consideration of a higher weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainty around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the Omicron variant. </p><p>Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term. As such, the Government decided, and it was announced on Thursday last (9<sup>th</sup>December), that the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy would apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. </p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p><p>The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but is now being extended to the end of January 2022 under the same Government decision of 9 December as mentioned above.  Provision is also being made to allow me, as Minister for Finance, to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial Order if deemed necessary.</p><p>Amendments to the Finance Bill 2021 were brought forward this week to give effect to the EWSS and CRSS changes mentioned.</p><p>Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

This year, Budget 2022 projected a general government deficit of &euro;13.3 billion, nearly 6 per cent of GNI*. </p>  <p>  Against this background, the Government has still made very extensive commitments in the area of housing. This reflects the priority which the Government places on boosting housing supply. </p>  <p>  To this end, the Housing for All plan commits to increase housing supply and affordability by targeting the delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes every year to 2030. This includes the provision of over 10,000 social homes per year and an average of 6,000 affordable homes to purchase or rent. The plan is supported by significant annual investment of over &euro;4 billion in guaranteed State funding over the next five years. </p>  <p>  While public investment has an obvious role in alleviating housing market pressures, there are also significant non-fiscal constraints. In particular, the public health measures needed to suppress the spread of the virus have placed a direct restriction on the construction of new housing. The industry is now facing increased costs and difficulty sourcing building materials as a result of the pandemic, high international demand, and Brexit. There are also skills shortages within the construction sector, which is why the Government is providing significant investment in skills and trades. As acknowledged in the report, simply increasing expenditure will not negate these capacity constraints. It is, therefore, a gross simplification to suggest that providing additional housing is purely a matter of increasing Exchequer funding.</p>  <p>  From a broader fiscal perspective, as the recovery gains strength, it is important to remember that it is neither sustainable nor prudent to run perpetual deficits. Even before the onset of Covid-19, Ireland&rsquo;s level of public debt per capita was one of the highest in the developed world.  The impact of the pandemic is expected to add nearly &euro;6,000 per person to this ratio by the end of the year, bringing the level of public indebtedness to &euro;47,250 for every citizen in this country.  </p>  <p>  Looking beyond the pandemic, a number of fiscal challenges lie ahead, including financing the digital and climate transitions, as well as making provision for the future costs of an ageing population. It is also important that fiscal buffers are rebuilt and public indebtedness is steadily reduced once the pandemic has passed, so we can address future shocks by providing support at the right time &ndash; as we have done over the past twenty months. </p>  <p>  While I keep close track of all important research published by the ESRI, I have not met with the Institute specifically to discuss this paper. However, it is important to note that since the publication of the paper, the ESRI have welcomed the fiscal stance taken in Budget 2022 and clarified that the analysis contained within the paper refers to a so-called &ldquo;steady-state&rdquo; scenario, a theoretical situation where macroeconomic and fiscal balance has been achieved and the government is not already running a very large deficit.</p>  <p>  Finally, while I greatly respect the analysis produced by the ESRI, the Institute does not have a monopoly on providing economic advice.  I get economic and fiscal advice from a broad range of specialists, including my own officials and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  In this vein, it is worth noting that the IFAC has welcomed the fiscal stance taken in the recent budget. </p></reply>

This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and design of a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  Before introducing such a tax it is important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant properties.  It is also essential to identify the reasons for vacancy, and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate. Appropriate exemptions from any charge will have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.</p>  <p>  The LPT returns in respect of around 1.9 million dwellings are currently being analysed by Revenue and include information on the number and location of unoccupied properties, and the reasons for and duration of this, as of 1 November 2021. I look forward to receiving the results of Revenue&rsquo;s analysis of this information early in 2022.  This analysis will be used together with other available sources of information to inform the optimum design of a Vacant Property Tax. The objective of the tax will be to increase the supply of housing to help address the housing challenge. It will not be primarily a revenue raising measure. In advance of the analysis of LPT returns and design of the tax it is not possible to provide estimates of the revenues the tax may generate. </p>  <p>  In designing the tax it will be important to achieve an appropriate balance between placing sufficient pressure on vacant home owners to allow the measure to actually work as an incentive, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners in a discriminatory way.  </p></reply>

Approximately &euro;2.9 billion has been allocated to departments, particularly the Departments of Health and Social Protection to facilitate their continued Covid response, while the remainder remains unallocated. The unallocated funds will allow the Government respond flexibly to the challenges of the pandemic as it evolves without impacting on baseline budgetary arithmetic. </p>  <p>  The primary income support schemes remain in place. The Pandemic Unemployment Payment, which to date has paid out nearly &euro;9 billion, reopened to workers impacted by the most recent set of restrictions. Furthermore, the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme will continue to operate at enhanced rates for December and January. Over &euro;8.5 billion has been paid to businesses to date through this scheme and its predecessor, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Going forward, we will continue to assess the supports available and ensure that they remain targeted to those most in need.  The Government has been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports but we have also been clear that these measures cannot run indefinitely given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer. </p></reply>

Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity now exceeds the level immediately preceding the pandemic (2019-Q4) by around 3 per cent. Improvements can also be seen in the labour market with the unemployment rate including PUP recipients now below 7 per cent, the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, early indications point towards an easing in growth rates in the domestic economy in the fourth quarter. Part of this is the continued adjustment in growth towards pre-pandemic trends with re-opening effects and pent-up demand tapering off. Clearly, any further deterioration in the current epidemiological situation that results in the re-introduction of significant restrictions would hamper the economic recovery. However, with our booster campaign ramping up, and around a third of those who are fully vaccinated having now received a third jab, I am confident that, once we overcome the fourth wave of the virus, our economy will strengthen. </p>  <p>  The UK plan to implement the new procedures and checks under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on a phased basis from January of next year is expected to have a negative impact on Irish exports due to increased trade frictions. To help in combatting this Ireland has been allocated over 1 billion euro from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve which will help support employment, businesses and local communities negatively affected by Brexit.</p>  <p>  Overall I am optimistic that the economy can continue to grow robustly, thanks largely to our economic model, our well educated work force and pro-enterprise culture. Our resilience and strength comes from being an economy that remains open to investment and facilitates trade across our borders. This has proven to be the fundamental strength of the Irish economy over decades and is still the case today.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s external trade has supported the economy throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The global economy experienced the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic in a reasonably symmetric way and a strong but uneven recovery is under way. The economies of our major trading partners, including the EU, are expected to rebound significantly this year and next, creating a supportive external environment for Ireland&rsquo;s trade going forward.</p>  <p>  Multinational sector trade proved very resilient during the pandemic, and has continued to experience strong growth in 2021. Indigenous sector trade was more detrimentally affected by the pandemic, but has been recovering in line with strengthening global demand.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the outlook for Irish indigenous exports is brighter in light of the strengthening global recovery, although Brexit is expected to have an impact on indigenous exports from next year. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the effects of globalisation, is in a strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term. This reflects the persistence of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness on the international stage, for both indigenous and multinational trade.</p>  <p>  Aside from Brexit and Covid-19, risks to Ireland&rsquo;s external position include supply-side bottlenecks in international goods trade, global inflationary pressures and general macroeconomic risks which threaten the anticipated recovery among our trading partners. As a small open economy, Ireland is particularly exposed global risks and my Department continues to monitor them closely.</p></reply>

As one of the most affected Member States by Brexit, I pay particular attention to the effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and to the Withdrawal Agreement, which includes the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Across the EU, solidarity with Ireland in respect of Brexit remains steadfast. The Member States support the Commission's approach in engaging and responding to genuine concerns from people and businesses in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my Budget speech in October, it is important that we continue to prepare for any unforeseen consequences over the coming period.

Ireland is to receive &euro;1.165 billion from the BAR, with the first disbursement of funds to be paid before the end of 2021. Funding will be directed at areas such as enterprise supports; supports for the agrifood and fisheries sectors, reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at our ports and airports. </p></reply>

This momentum reflects our coordinated policy support, successful vaccine rollout and the boost to reforms and investment now that recovery funding has started to flow. Indeed, growth figures for the third quarter show that the euro area is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels of output.</p>  <p>  However, the uptick in new cases and emergence of the omicron variant present a downside risk to the economic outlook. In addition, the sharp rebound in global demand and persistent production and transport disruptions has brought elevated rates of inflation. </p>  <p>  The latest Eurostat estimates point to euro area annual inflation of 4.9 per cent in November. This was largely driven by energy inflation, which increased to an estimated 27.4 per cent. Pandemic-related effects, such as the impact of temporary VAT reductions, and technical factors, such as measurement issues, added further volatility. HICP inflation reached 5.4 per cent in Ireland in the same period. </p>  <p>  The latest figures point to inflation, including energy prices, remaining high over the course of the year, before gradually easing next year. The ECB projects inflation to average 2.2 per cent this year but to decline to rates of 1.7 and 1.5 per cent in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Both the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated inflation is linked to temporary factors, supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the ECB has an independent mandate to maintain price stability, and uses the range of monetary policy instruments to target an inflation rate of 2 per cent over the medium-term. The ECB has stated that the outlook for inflation over the medium-term remains subdued. Core inflation &ndash; which strips out energy and non-processed food inflation &ndash; was 2.6 per cent in November.</p>  <p>  That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation and raise costs for businesses and families. In recognition of these potential social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty. In framing Budget 2022, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures and announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives. </p>  <p>  In addition, at an EU level, the Commission has issued a Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations. The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response.</p>  <p>  In short, my fellow Finance Ministers and I all agree that this is an important issue and that we need to continue closely monitoring inflation and energy price developments and the potential implications for our economies. </p></reply>

Pillar One will see a reallocation of a proportion of profits to the jurisdiction of the consumer. This means that, in effect, corporate tax revenue streams which now flow to the Irish Exchequer will flow to the Exchequers of other countries when implemented.</p>  <p>  Pillar Two will see the adoption of a new global minimum effective tax rate of 15 per cent applying to multinational companies (MNEs) with global revenues in excess of &euro;750m. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent will remain for the vast majority of Irish businesses. The threshold that will apply to the 15 per cent minimum effective tax rate is &euro;750 million annual global turnover. Thus, the vast majority of companies in Ireland - over 95 per cent - will not be subject to these new rules, and will continue to be subject to corporation tax at a headline rate of 12.5 per cent. </p>  <p>  At a superficial level, the application of a minimum tax rate of 15 per cent under Pillar Two could provide some uplift to domestic corporation tax revenues. However, this would be a static assumption which does not take account of how firms react to a new tax regime, or to potential changes in tax regimes in other jurisdictions i.e. changes to the tax base. Further, any uplift on Pillar Two would be countered by the potential cost of Pillar One. That cost remains highly uncertain as its technical implementation is still far from resolved.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Revenue Commissioners previously estimated that the cost of the OECD agreement on a new tax framework to address the tax challenges of digitalisation could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. However, as I have stated previously, this is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. Although there are two pillars to this Agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which this interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.</p>  <p>  It should also be stressed that what we have at the moment is a broad high level agreement on the main features of a solution. Discussions are continuing and will continue into 2022 on how the agreement will be implemented in practice. As technical discussions on the implementation framework continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review and, when and if necessary, my Department will provide an update on how the agreement is expected to impact the public finances. The Agreement is planned to come into effect from 2023.</p>  <p>  An historic agreement such as this presents challenges to all countries, including Ireland. However, I believe that I have safeguarded Ireland's interests and I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will remain an attractive location and &lsquo;best in class&rsquo; when multinationals look to investment locations. My commitment, and that of the Irish Government, remains clear &ndash; we will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will remain competitive, fair and sustainable.  Ireland will continue to have an attractive tax offering, and we will keep and continue to create many good jobs.  </p></reply>

The latest data from the CSO confirms that following a steep decline at the start of 2021, the domestic economy has subsequently made a rapid recovery.</p>  <p>  Against the backdrop of the pandemic, inward FDI flows to Ireland still amounted to around one-fifth of GDP in 2020 according to the OECD, the second highest in the EU and significantly higher than the OECD average. Ireland remains internationally recognised as a competitive country. According to IMD, Ireland ranked 13th in its world competitiveness rankings in 2021. With the economic recovery underway, FDI investment will continue to play a crucial role in helping to ensure a strong and sustainable recovery going forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s FDI performance in recent years has been exceptional and we have built a reputation as a resilient, innovative and stable location to do business. This provides a strong foundation on which Ireland can build upon in coming years.</p>  <p>  Despite the disruptions caused by Covid to the global FDI landscape, Ireland remains an attractive prospect for foreign direct investment, as foreign firms recognise Ireland&rsquo;s unique competitive advantages, namely our talented and flexible workforce, our hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction, and our successful record as a home for global business.</p></reply>

This momentum reflects the success of our coordinated policy support, the vaccine rollout, the introduction of structural reforms and the recovery funding that is now flowing across Europe. </p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Autumn Forecast remains positive about EU growth momentum, though growing headwinds to the economic outlook are signalled. The Commission projects growth of 5.0 per cent this year and 4.3 per cent next year in both the EU and euro area. While the pace of recovery is varying, it is positive to note from the Forecasts that the Commission expects the EU to return to its path of economic convergence.</p>  <p>  That said, the recent uptick in cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant present significant downside risks to the outlook. It is imperative that we continue work to understand this variant and respond as quickly as we can to mitigate its impact. However, our vaccination programmes have managed to substantially reduce the link between infections and hospitalisations. This means that any new wave of cases will have a smaller impact on economic activity than during previous waves. </p>  <p>  Beyond the evolution of the virus, the economic landscape is also facing other challenges, such as inflation, rising energy prices and supply constraints. We will continue to monitor these issues closely and take action where necessary &ndash; as we have done with measures to tackle energy price inflation. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, strong coordinated policy actions at EU and national levels have helped to limit the economic impact of Covid-19 and to support those most affected. We acted to protect incomes, support businesses and invest in our healthcare capacity and vaccination programmes.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.699.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600063#WRM03200"><p>The Irish insurance sector is diverse, comprising life, non-life and reinsurance firms providing a range of products and operating across a number of geographic markets.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing regulation of this sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  These are to:</p>  <p>  - establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by Central Bank of Ireland);</p>  <p>  - establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FoE); or</p>  <p>  - operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FoS), i.e. conduct business in Ireland from another country.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that companies operate within each of these channels in the Irish insurance market, in addition to Irish companies operating across the EU on a similar basis.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of market access, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation. It also expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules that require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  I understand from my officials that it is difficult to obtain reliable data to compare the cost of insurance here to that in other jurisdictions throughout Europe.  I am informed that international organisations, such as the OECD and Eurostat, do not publish comparative data on the cost of insurance between countries. Eurostat publishes Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data with regard to insurance, but this only provides a comparison of the level of inflation for different types of insurance such as motor and travel insurance. It is not possible to compare the underlying cost of each insurance type.  In addition, this does not include a comparative index for the price of insurance to businesses.</p>  <p>  In any event, any international comparisons based on price alone would not take into account relevant factors such as the various regulatory environments and liability systems in place in different jurisdictions.  However, increased availability of data in relation to insurance and understanding the factors that influence or drive the cost of it are important. In Ireland, we have the National Claims Information Database (NCID), which is unique in Europe in terms of the transparency it provides into the insurance sector, including claims costs and average earned premium data. The Central Bank of Ireland has published three NCID reports on private motor insurance and one NCID report on employer liability, public liability and commercial property insurance to date. The Central Bank of Ireland will continue to publish regular reports that will provide us with a wealth of data in terms of how insurance costs are affecting different groups. The Government has also proposed for further enhancements to be made to the NCID in the new Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, to further increase transparency in the sector. The Heads of that Bill are currently going through the pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p>  <p>  With regard to the competitiveness of the Irish insurance sector more generally, I believe that the implementation of the outstanding Action Plan for Insurance Reform elements will have a positive impact. In July, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan. This showed that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions completed.  Work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care.  The implementation of these key actions in particular are anticipated to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.702.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600063#WRM03500"><p>I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries, though it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland.  For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.73% in October 2021.  There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks);</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years;</p>  <p>  - lower levels of competition in the Irish banking market compared to other jurisdictions (however, it is noted that non-bank lenders are now playing a greater role in the provision of new mortgage credit and are offering long term fixed rate mortgages at competitive interest rates). </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has a range of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.  The consumer protection framework requires lenders to be transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; through protections at the initial marketing/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties.  In particular, the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products their lender provides which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the CCPC&rsquo;s mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible.  Indeed a Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remain term. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, however, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.  </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and look at options to further develop the mortgage market. </p></reply>

My Department commissions a survey biannually to monitor SME credit levels which are published on <i>www.Gov.ie</i>. Furthermore, since the onset of COVID-19 restrictions the Government has introduced a range of measures to assist companies and to ensure that they have access to sufficient liquidity.  This include loan schemes available through the SBCI, which support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs.</p><p>SME borrowers who are applying for, or have accessed, credit continue to have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations, which are available at <i>centralbank.ie/news/article/regulations-for-firms-lending-to-smes-from-2016</i>set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. </p><p>In addition, the Credit Review Office was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review Office after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB. Further information is available at <i>www.creditreview.ie</i></p><p>I will continue to work to ensure that access to credit for SMEs is maintained. I also continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the relevant Central Bank protections and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to borrowers.</p></reply>

This recovery of spending continued in the third quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace. Spending growth of &frac12; per cent on the quarter was surprisingly soft particularly given that additional contact-intensive services sectors re-opened, the ongoing strength of VAT receipts and the recovery in employment and wages. Nevertheless, consumer spending remains around 1 per cent below the pre-pandemic level despite standing at almost 15 per cent below that level in the first quarter this year. </p>  <p>  This rapid recovery in consumer spending was supported by the protection of household incomes throughout the pandemic through the provision of government supports in the form of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. This support to household balance sheets and in-turn to consumer confidence has helped to minimise &ldquo;scarring effects&rdquo; of the crisis, a key overarching policy objective. In addition, the Government has continued to provide support to the sectors worst affected by the pandemic, including the reduced VAT rate for the hospitality sector until end-August 2022.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, early indications point toward a continued moderation of consumer spending growth in the fourth quarter, with the recovery expected to continue into next year. This recovery in consumption will be underpinned by a normalisation of household savings following the record increase in savings built up since the start of the pandemic. However, we must be cognisant that if an excessive amount of savings flow into areas where demand is already strong and supply is already under pressure, it could add to current inflationary pressures. In light of these risks, my Department will continue to monitor incoming data very closely over the coming months and act as appropriate.</p></reply>

However, he should be aware that all taxes are subject to ongoing review which includes the consideration and assessment of rates along with any associated reliefs and exemptions. Tax policy in relation to CGT is reviewed by the Tax Strategy Group as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process and considered in the wider tax policy context. </p><p>The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to help first time buyers .</p><p>Earlier this year the Government brought in a 10% stamp levy on institutional investors purchasing in excess of 10 houses in any 12 month period, in response to large numbers of houses bring purchased by funds before they could go on the open market. This measure was complemented by guidelines introduced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 titled Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing.  </p><p>Secondly, the Government launched the comprehensive &quot;Housing for All&quot; strategy. &quot;Housing for All&quot; is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs and this government has allocated a record amount of funding for housing under the strategy. </p><p>In addition to the above, as outlined in my response to the Deputy of 24 March 2021, there are existing reliefs that are already available to property owners selling their home and to first-time buyers. They are as set out below.</p><p>Help to Buy Scheme </p><p>The Help to Buy incentive is a scheme that is targeted at first time purchasers and assists them with a deposit to buy or build a new house or apartment.  The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to certain limits set out in section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p><p>In August 2020, an enhancement to the Help To Buy scheme was made as part of the July Stimulus package, which was later extended in Finance Act 2020. In summary, where a first-time purchaser </p><p>(i)  enters into a contract for the purchase of a new home, or</p><p>(ii) makes the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build;</p><p>during the period 23 July 2020 and 31 December 2021, they can avail of increased relief under Help to Buy scheme, based on the lesser of:  </p><p>- &euro;30,000 (increased from &euro;20,000), </p><p>- 10 per cent (increased from 5 per cent) of the purchase price of a new home or the completion value of the property in the case of self builds, or, </p><p>- the amount of Income Tax and DIRT paid in the four years prior to making the application.</p><p>This is subject to the person meeting a number of conditions set out in the legislation.  Further guidance on the Help To Buy scheme is available on the Revenue website at: <i>revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-46.pdf</i></p><p>To date, the Help to Buy scheme has helped individuals and couples buy or build more than 28,000 homes. These enhanced arrangements were initially extended until the end of 2021 and, subsequently, in my Budget 2022 address, I announced an extension for a further year until the end of 2022. The intention is that the HTB extension will allow time for other Housing for All measures with similar policy objectives to be put in place in the period ahead. </p><p>In that speech I also announced that a formal review of the HTB scheme would take place in 2022. It is the intention that the review will be fundamental in nature, and that it will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022. </p><p>Capital Gains Tax</p><p>Capital gains tax (CGT) is chargeable on any gain arising on the disposal of an asset at the rate of 33%. The first &euro;1,270 of chargeable gains of an individual in any year are exempt from CGT. Where certain conditions are met, a person may be able to avail of relief from CGT in respect of a gain arising on the disposal of a property. These include the following: </p><p>(i) If the property was occupied by an individual as his or her principal private residence for all or part of his or her period of ownership, then full or partial relief from CGT will be available where a chargeable gain arises on the disposal of that property. The last 12 months of ownership of the house by the individual is treated as a period of occupation for this purpose. </p><p>(ii) If the property was acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014, then full or partial relief from CGT will be available where a chargeable gain arises. Full relief will apply if the property has been owned by an individual for a period of 7 years. Where the property has been owned by an individual for a period of more than 7 years, relief is given on the gain in the proportion that the period of 7 years bears to the period of ownership. For example, if the property was owned for 8 years, relief will be given on 7/8ths of the gain. Where the property is held for at least 4 years and less than 7 years, any gain will not be liable to CGT where the disposal is made on or after 1 January 2018. </p><p>To be eligible for principal private residence relief and the relief for property acquired between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2014, a person is not required to dispose of a property to a buyer within a particular category.</p><p>(iii) In addition, CGT will not be payable on the disposal of a site from a parent to a child, where the child builds their principal private residence on the site. To qualify for this relief, the site in question must be one acre or less and have a value of &euro;500,000 or less. A clawback of the relief may arise if the child fails to build a house on the site or does not occupy a house built on the site as their only or main residence for at least three years.</p><p>Guidelines on the reliefs outlined above are available on the Revenue website at: <i>www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cgt-reliefs/index.aspx</i></p></reply>

These Acts provide that compensation is payable for net damages arising from compulsory interference and acquisition.  Compensation provisions are largely guided by sections 14-17 of the 1945 Act and section 11 of the 1995 Act which apply provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 and the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919. </p>  <p>  Any landowner who feels they have suffered a loss is entitled to claim compensation.  Every comprehensive claim should be made in writing, to which the Commissioners must respond.  While there is no provision for declaring works as &ldquo;statute barred&rdquo; in default of agreement, the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 provides for the appointment of a statutory arbitrator to rule on compensation payable.  Section 5(2) of the 1919 Act provides more detail on what an arbitrator (and by extension the Commissioners) requires by way of a written claim to which the Commissioners must respond.</p>  <p>  Speaking in general terms, it should be noted that compensation addresses both losses to land and disturbance.  Whilst losses to land are apparent, disturbance losses (e.g. to business activity) are only knowable by the owner (claimant) and if an owner expects to be compensated for such losses they must declare and justify them in their claim.</p></reply>

Minister Martin attended the Ryder Cup in 2021 in the U.S. and while there met with the venue owner and the organisers on the 24th of September 2021. This was part of a visit to the US promoting Ireland as a tourism destination organised by Tourism Ireland.  My officials last met with the venue owners on 19th December 2019 and are in frequent dialogue with the event organisers, calls or e-mails are exchanged on at least a monthly basis.  The last in-person meeting with the event organisers took place prior to the pandemic in London on 17th January 2020.  The costs for these meetings are being compiled and I will forward the details to the Deputy in accordance with the timelines set out in standing orders.  The Department is also working with and regularly meets stakeholders including Sport Ireland, Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Limerick City and County Council and other public sector bodies in planning for the event. </p>  <p>  In July 2019, after an extended period of consideration and negotiation, including an assessment of the costs and benefits, the Government approved a package of financial support for the hosting of the event to which the Deputy refers.  The main payment to the event organisers, to host the event is an event licence fee.  The first year of payment was in 2020 and, on foot of a payment agreement drafted by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, &euro;3.2 million of the licence fee was paid to the event organisers. A similar agreement was put in place for 2021. Allowing for the fact that the event was rescheduled to 2027 from 2026, the payment for 2021 encompassed a licence fee instalment of &euro;2.755m. Payment levels similar to 2021 are envisaged for each year between 2022 and 2027 for the licence fee. The licence fee in total is scheduled to cost &euro;22.5 million, not including VAT which is paid to the Irish Exchequer.</p>  <p>  To strengthen the professional game in Ireland in the run up to the event, additional financial support of &euro;8.5million is also being provided for professional golf events i.e. the Irish Open, the Challenge and Legends Tour Events scheduled to take place in Ireland up and including 2027.  Marketing of the event will also form a key part of the preparations for the hosting and a budget of &euro;8m will be provided for marketing through and with the European Tour.  </p>  <p>  Separate to this an operational budget will be required to support the staging of the event to cover matters such as policing, local authority support, transport provision as well as an opening ceremony and fanzone.  These supports will ensure that Ireland can maximise the opportunity which this tournament affords Ireland, the Mid-West and Limerick city and county.</p>  <p>  It is best practice to draw lessons learned from all major events and this event will be no different. In that regard, a review of the event including the delivery, costs, operation and impacts will be conducted after the event.   </p></reply>

Our overall vision is for women to have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  Both the Programme for Government and the National Sports Policy are unequivocal in their commitment to making this a reality.</p>  <p>  The aim in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap entirely by 2027.  The Programme for Government commits to prioritise increasing female participation in sport as participants, coaches, referees, and administrators as well as to increase funding year on year for the Sport Ireland's Women in Sports Programme. </p>  <p>  The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor Report, which is the most recent full year report, showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years.  However, recent quarterly figures show that a gender gap is beginning to re-emerge as COVID 19 restrictions are lifted.  Addressing this will be a priority in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Last month I launched the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023.  The Plan outlines over 40 specific initiatives intended to ensure the sports sector's continued recovery from the impact of COVID-19, its development over the next three years and the actions required to achieve the target of 60pc of the population participating in sport and physical activity.  The plan focuses on inclusion, diversity and equality and includes targets for active participation, social participation, governance and high performance sport.  A copy of the plan can be found at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/93232-sports-action-plan-2021-2023/</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  This includes the allocation of funding to sporting organisations for the implementation of a range of programmes and measures to increase the level of girls and women participating in sport and to address inequalities in sports participation.</p>  <p>  Many National Governing Bodies will begin to deliver Women in Sport and Dormant Accounts Funded Programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the Pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  The Women in Sport Funding Programme was established in 2005 and to date over &euro;20 million has been invested through the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Sports Partnerships.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland launched a revised Women in Sport investment programme in 2019 following publication of its new Women in Sport Policy.  Recognising that effective and sustainable programmes require a long-term approach, Women in Sport funding is now issues on a two year cycle to the National Governing Bodies.  &euro;4m is being allocated for the two years 2021/2022 representing a 33% increase on the 2019-2020 funding of &euro;3m.  The investment aims to support NGBs and enhance all aspects of female involvement across the Women in Sport policy target areas namely, Coaching &amp;amp; Officiating, Active Participation, Leadership &amp;amp; Governance and Visibility.</p>  <p>  A priority this year was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grand funding for male and female Gaelic players and I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and ensured that we have now parity in terms of that grant funding.  Additional funding of &euro;1.7m has been provided this year and for future years for enhanced support of female inter-county Gaelic games players on an equivalent basis to that being provided for their male counterparts.  This additional provision brings the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4m.  This is a very important development for women's sport and demonstrates the Government's commitment to equality in sport.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Minister Catherine Martin and I received a letter on Friday from 59 female international rugby players, both currently active and retired, regarding issues they have with the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU).  We have responded to the group to advise that a meeting will be sought with the IRFU and that Sport Ireland will meet with the players to discuss the issues raised.  Both Minister Martin and I indicated that we were also happy to meeting with the players should that be needed, and we plan to do so before Christmas.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department have been engaging with the CSO on this issue with a view to reinstating such data collection as soon as circumstances allow. Given the current uncertain nature of the international travel environment, as a result of the impact of the pandemic, it is not possible to provide a target for tourist visitor numbers in 2022 at this point with any degree of accuracy. I can assure the Deputy that I am continuing to work closely with the sector and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to ensure a sustainable recovery for the sector in the context of the pandemic. </p></reply>

The total funding applied for under the scheme significantly exceeded the amount available to allocate and it was not possible to allocate grants to many worthy projects.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now well over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department met with all grantees in this regard and this process is now nearing completion.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.

The property in question must also meet certain eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  A Review of the MTR scheme for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions published in February 2017 explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and identified a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers. As a result of the improvements implemented, an upward trend in case completions has been evident since 2018.</p>  <p>  In the 2017 Review it was acknowledged that consideration needed to be given to the capacity of AHBs to intensify their involvement in the MTR scheme given the ambitious targets for the AHB sector around delivering new social housing supply.  The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale. </p>  <p>  An Expressions of Interest (EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) acted as financial advisor during the process, undertaking due diligence on the financial capacity of the proposers to commit to the long-term undertaking of the scheme.  It was critical that the entity (or entities selected) were capable of purchasing the required number of MTR cases, demonstrated the appropriate understanding of the MTR process and the position of borrowers in long-term mortgage arrears, as well as the capacity to undertake the management and structural maintenance of properties over the lifetime of the lease agreement.  The outcome from the EOI process is that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model was announced in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd as the participant from the private sector. </p>  <p>  At the present time there are no plans to run another Expressions of Interest process for further private MTR providers. </p></reply>

These commitments are further supported by actions contained in Housing For All.</p><p>In this context, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August), in addition to subgroup meetings. </p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were adopted in May 2021 and are focused on purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013 in Ireland.Part of the work of the group is to establish the scale of the issue, including estimating the number of dwellings affected and their location.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- Individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- Routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group is engaging with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I look forward to receiving the report of the Working Group when it has concluded its deliberations.</p></reply>

Government approved the enchanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include:</p><p>- The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5</p><p>- The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000 </p><p>- The grant calculation methodology in resepct of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot  with costings to be set by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI </p><p>- A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p><p>- Alternative accommodation and storage costs are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000</p><p>- In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS;465 standard</p><p>- A new independent appeals process will be introduced</p><p>- The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. Opportunities for the State to acquire such rental properties for social housing purposes will also be examined.</p><p>Full details in relation to the changes announced are available at the following link;</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e365e-minister-obrien-announces-enhancements-to-the-defective-concrete-block-scheme/</p><p>In determining the indicative cost per square foot to be used, my Department consulted with the SCSI in relation to their re-build calculator.The purpose of those  discussions was to gain a full understanding of the methodology behind the SCSI rebuild guide and whether in fact it was a suitable benchmark for the scheme. The discussions also involved consideration of what role SCSI could play in assisting my Department with up to date information on construction costs.</p><p>Following the Government decision on the enhanced scheme, I and officials from my Department met with the SCSI on the 3<sup></sup>December 2021 to work on terms of reference for further engagement on the issue of costs. The SCSI will be completely independent in any engagement on this issue. I aim to bring forward final proposals and legislation in respect of the enhanced scheme in early 2022. </p></reply>

Legislation setting out the provisions relating to the tax measure are included in Finance Bill 2021, which concluded all stages in the Oireachtas this week.      </p>  <p>  The purpose of the proposed measure is to activate existing residential zonings where the land is serviced, but remains undeveloped.  It is primarily intended to influence behaviour towards increased housing output, rather than to raise revenue. </p>  <p>  The scope of the tax is based on lands zoned for housing development on statutory development plan or local area plan zoning maps (either solely or primarily for residential use, or for a mixture of uses that includes residential use), where such lands are &lsquo;serviced&rsquo;, in that they are able to connect to the necessary infrastructure to enable housing development and for which there is capacity available, with land subject to known issues relating to contamination or the presence of known archaeological or historic remains to be excluded. Social, recreational and community uses as well as infrastructure and utilities will be excluded from the scope of the tax.</p>  <p>  The lands falling into scope, being, in the first instance, all land zoned as of 1 January 2022 and meeting criteria set out in the legislation, including with regard to servicing and taking into account any exclusions, must be identified by each local authority on &lsquo;residential zoned land&rsquo; maps to be published in advance of the introduction of the measure on 1 February 2024.</p>  <p>  Each local authority will be required to prepare and publish a map to indicate the land within the scope of the tax, with the final map to be published by 1 December 2023.  In advance of this, it will be necessary to publish an initial draft map by 1 November 2022 to identify the land in question. Preparation of the map will involve consultation with infrastructure providers to provide a robust evidence base with regard to servicing, including capacity. </p>  <p>  The timescales for the various stages of the process including provisions for appeal of inclusion of lands on the draft map are set out in the Finance Bill and will be clarified within Guidelines to be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to ensure the maps will be published and updated by each local authority by 1 December 2023, in advance of the measure coming into effect on 1 February 2024. </p>  <p>  Once established, maps will be updated every year, to reflect any changes in zoning, development servicing status or other criteria which would bring land into or out of scope. Where any land comes into scope after 1 January 2022, such land would not be liable for the tax until 3 years later. </p>  <p>  This measure will replace the Vacant Site Levy once the tax becomes operational on the 1 February 2024. My Department will bring forward separate transitionary legislation to repeal the vacant site levy arrangements and this will take account of lands that might otherwise fall out of the full scope of the Vacant Site Levy, that are currently subject to the Vacant Site Levy.</p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p><p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020. </p><p>Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between valuation of rateable property and the levying and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p><p>Valuation lists comprising all rateable properties in the State are maintained using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;. </p><p>Firstly, revaluation is a process where all rateable properties in a Local Authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation (Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001).</p><p>Secondly, revision is a process to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. It is a function of a local authority to apply to the Commissioner of Valuation for the appointment by the Commissioner of an officer of the Commissioner to carry out a revision of valuation under Part 6 of the Valuation Acts 2001 (as amended by the Act of 2015).</p><p>In line with best international practice, the valuation element of the rating system should have both a comprehensive revaluation and revision programme running in tandem. Further information about these processes is available at <i>www.valoff.ie/en/ </i></p><p>New rateable properties are added to the valuation lists on foot of revision applications made by the relevant Local Authority to the Commissioner of Valuation. Once a new rateable properties is capable of beneficial occupation it can be valued and entered on the valuation list whether it is occupied or vacant. Section 28(5) of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020 provides that once a valuer had been assigned a revision application the property referenced in the application should be valued and entered on the valuation list within 6 months. </p><p>While the average length of time it takes to put a rateable valuation on a new rateable property that has never been occupied is not available it is important to note that valuing a new rateable property involves a number of statutory steps. The process usually begins with an inspection of the property which is followed with the issue of a proposed valuation certificate to the owner or occupier of the property. The owner or occupier may within 40 days of the issue of the proposed valuation certificate make representations to the Valuation Office. Any representations received must then be considered before the valuation is determined and a final valuation certificate is issued. The Valuations Acts provide for the valuation list to be amended seven days after the issue of the final valuation certificate.</p><p>Where a property is newly entered onto the valuation list by the Commissioner of Valuation during a financial year it is not subject to rates in that year, however, it is subject to an Entry Year Property Levy under section 7 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006. The Entry Year Property Levy effectively imposes rates on properties with effect from the date of their entry on valuation lists.  It is a charge that applies until such time as the property can be charged rates. A commercial property is liable for rates in the normal way in the financial year immediately following its entry onto the valuation list.  </p><p>Existing commercial rates legislation provides for a refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances. The Local Government Act 1946, provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. A decision to vary the level of rate refund applying is a reserved function of elected members of a local authority.</p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernises the legislation governing commercial rates and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties (not yet commenced). The Act provides that a local authority may provide a temporary abatement for vacant properties, subject to any maximum relief which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners (other than those whose rates liability would be below a de minimis threshold) make some level of payment to the local authority.  The Act allows the Minister to prescribe, that the maximum level of relief can be further reduced by individual local authorities.  Currently only a portion of the Act has been commenced.

These will be delivered in our urban centres where affordability issues arise. They will be provided by Affordable Housing Bodies (AHBs) through Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, by Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund and by the Land Development Agency (LDA) on their portfolio of sites.</p><p>A total of 390 Cost Rental homes were approved under the first tranche of CREL funding in early 2021. These new homes are located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and Cork, with cost-covering rents projected at a minimum of 25% less than comparable open market prices.</p><p>The first 25 of Cost Rental homes to be designated in Ireland were completed by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan and the first tenants moved into their new homes at Taylor Hill from 28 August 2021. The cost-covering rents for these homes are approximately 40% below comparable open-market prices in the area, ranging from &euro;935 per month for a two-bed terraced house to &euro;1,150 for a four-bed detached house. Another 40 Cost Rental homes have recently been completed at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, County Kildare, where all tenants have recently moved into their new homes. The cost-covering rents for these CREL-funded homes range from &euro;900 per month for the two-bed homes to &euro;1,250 per month for the three-bed homes, which are approximately 42% below market rent. (See tables below for details of both developments). <table>    <tr>       <th>Taylor Hill Homes</th>       <th>Average Comparable Market Rent </th>       <th>Cost-covering Rent </th>       <th>% Discount from Market Rent </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Taylor Hill Homes</td>       <td>Average Comparable Market Rent </td>       <td>Cost-covering Rent </td>       <td>% Discount from Market Rent </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2-bed terraces (x7)   (77.8- 88.6m2)</td>       <td>&euro;1,467 </td>       <td>&euro;935 </td>       <td>36.26% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3-bed terraces, semi-detached   and detached (x17) (102-120m2)</td>       <td>&euro;1,729 </td>       <td>&euro;1,100 </td>       <td>36.38% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4-bed detached (x1)   (149.4m2)</td>       <td>&euro;2,050 </td>       <td>&euro;1,150 </td>       <td>43.9% </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th>Barnhall Meadows</th>       <th>Average Comparable Market Rent </th>       <th>Cost-covering Rent </th>       <th>% Discount from Market Rent </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Barnhall Meadows</td>       <td>Average Comparable Market Rent </td>       <td>Cost-covering Rent </td>       <td>% Discount from Market Rent </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2-bed house (x6) (86m2) </td>       <td>&euro;1,600 </td>       <td>&euro;900 </td>       <td>43.75% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3-bed house (x34)(109-121m2) </td>       <td>&euro;2,150 </td>       <td>&euro;1,250 </td>       <td>41.86% </td>    </tr> </table> The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to the other projects approved under the first call for proposals under CREL are being completed by the AHBs concerned. When these arrangements are concluded, details of the other projects, including specific locations, housing typologies and cost-covering rents, will be made public.</p><p>In addition to these 390 homes, another 50 two bed Cost Rental apartments are currently being constructed at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, by the Respond and Tuath AHBs, alongside 105 social housing units. Construction of these purpose-built Cost Rental homes is due to be completed before the end of the year. The tenant selection process is underway and the new tenants will move into their new homes early in the new year. Proposed rents for these Cost Rental units are show in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Unit Type</th>       <th>Average Comparable Market Rent</th>       <th>Cost-covering Rent</th>       <th>% Discount from Market Rent</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2-bed apartments (x 50)</td>       <td>&euro;2,000 per month</td>       <td>&euro;1,200 per month</td>       <td>40%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Delivery of CREL homes is subject to construction schedules, which, together with housing projects more generally, were impacted by COVID delays at the beginning of this year. The initial timeframes submitted by AHBs were based on all efforts being made to deliver the homes as soon as possible. As AHBs sought to use CREL funding to allow developers to construct homes that may otherwise not have been delivered, the commencement of construction on these specific units was, in most instances, not possible until the lifting of relevant COVID restrictions.</p><p>A further &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2022. Combined with funds made available by the Housing Finance Agency, this will help to meet the Housing for All target of a further 750 Cost Rental homes. A second Call for Proposals was opened to AHBs under the CREL scheme on Friday 22 October 2021, seeking applications for properties prioritised for delivery in 2022. The closing date for this call expired on Tuesday 30 November. The process to assess these applications is currently ongoing.</p><p>Furthermore, it is my intention to issue an Open, Rolling Call under CREL from early 2022. This will facilitate ongoing applications from AHBs as projects present themselves, assist with applications for Cost Rental and social housing (through Capital Advance Leasing Facility CALF) on the same sites and will facilitate longer-term developments where AHBs can purchase land and undertake design and build contracts directly.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy and progressing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p><p>The most recent review of fire services in Ireland resulted in the publication of &ldquo;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&rdquo; (KCS) in 2013. This was the report on the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011/2012, and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland. </p><p>The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach of area risk categorisation which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. The current fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three year average, equates to 4.3 deaths per million of population, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. While every death is a regrettable tragedy that level of fire fatalities positions Ireland among countries with lower fire fatality rates.</p><p>Fire authorities cooperate with each other as and when required and on a regular basis on a number of matters. For example, they are enabled by the Fire Services Act, 1981 and 2003 to assist each other and provide support on a &lsquo;mutual-assistance&rsquo; basis, and this is the expected norm for fire services. The Chief Fire Officer for the area where a large scale incident is located will typically engage neighbouring services when required, on the basis of agreed pre-planned arrangements.</p><p>At national level, a National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) was created within my Department in 2009 to give central direction and leadership for the fire and emergency management services. The 2009 arrangements put in place a management structure at central government level with a clear mandate and visibility to develop national policy and to drive consistent achievement of quality fire services by local authorities. Under the system, responsibility for the day-to-day operation of fire services remains with the local authorities. However, the National Directorate&rsquo;s mandate includes developing national policies and national standards, and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.</p><p>Over the course of 2014/2015, the National Directorate&rsquo;s Management Board's External Validation Group (EVG) visited every fire service in the country as part of an external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. The report concluded that current fire service arrangements, as outlined, are working effectively to meet the challenges involved in trying to protect communities from fire and other emergencies.</p><p>A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/a23ce-external-validation-of-fire-services/</i></p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process.</p><p>As an alternative, the Management Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. </p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. A composite report on themes related to the impact of Covid-19 on fire services was compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in October 2020.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current Covid-19 situation has understandably delayed the EVG II process. The position in relation to undertaking an EVG II will be kept under review by the NDFEM Management Board, taking account of the virtual experience of the response and resilience study and in light of the evolving Covid-19 situation. A new EVG II process would likely focus once again on the delivery standards of our fire services and an assessment of how the structure of the service impacts on delivery.</p></reply>

Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn. The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5</p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000 </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in resepct of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with costings to be set by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in consultation with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes. In the case of remediation options 2-5 a similar but necessarily different approach will be taken to inform the appropriate rate for blockwork removal and replacement following consultation with SCSI </p>  <p>  - A revised application process will be introduced which will only require the homeowner to submit an initial &lsquo;Building Condition Assessment&rsquo; at minimal cost recoupable on entry to the Scheme. The Housing Agency will take over testing, sampling and categorisation of homes on behalf of homeowners and local authorities and will thereafter recommend the appropriate remediation option and grant amount for each home. </p>  <p>  - Alternative accommodation and storage costs  are to be included, subject to a maximum of &euro;20,000</p>  <p>  - In relation to works carried out under remediation options 2-5, a second grant option, will be available for such a home in the future if blockwork which was not removed as part of the initial remediation work subsequently proves defective in accordance with the IS:465 standard</p>  <p>  - A new independent appeals process will be introduced</p>  <p>  - The Scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of Principal Private Residences only, to also cover Residential Tenancies Board registered rental properties, subject to the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used.

Under Housing for All there are unprecedented resources available to support public housing programmes. Implementation of these programmes at local level, in terms of priority and location, will be matters for our local authorities in meeting their housing needs. In that regard, each local authority is now finalising new Housing Delivery Action Plans to set out details on how and when they will deliver their housing targets, including the alignment with the National Planning Framework (NPF), in particular compact growth objectives. These Action Plans should also provide an outline of locations where housing will be delivered (e.g. towns, villages, urban areas, rural areas, etc.) and the planned numbers of homes to be delivered in each area.</p>  <p>  The NPF is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland. It fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas and the need to ensure their continued function as places to live, work and invest in. The NPF seeks to encourage their growth and to arrest the decline of areas that have experienced low population growth in recent years. Chapter 5.3 &lsquo;Planning for the Future Growth and Development of Rural Areas&rsquo; of the NPF features several specific National Policy Objectives that aim to support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland and deliver strengthened and diversified rural communities.</p>  <p>  In support of this, Housing for All contains commitments in relation a new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund to provide serviced sites for the construction of new homes and refurbish vacant properties in regional towns and villages; a new Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) Programme to tackle vacancy in towns and villages; and new rural housing guidelines to provide updated guidance to planning authorities in devising such policies in their county development plans.</p>  <p>  There are also a range of actions relating to housing and associated areas in the Government&rsquo;s framework for the development of rural Ireland over the next five years, &lsquo;Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025&rsquo;.</p></reply>

This enforcement action has included the carrying out of inspections of properties engaged in short-term letting, identifying the registered owners of the properties concerned, issuing enforcement notices to relevant property owners of the requirements of the Regulations to obtain change of use planning permission where the property concerned - </p>  <p>  (i) is not the principal place of residence of the registered owner, or </p>  <p>  (ii) is their principal residence and has been let out for in excess of 90 days in a calendar year. </p>  <p>  Non-compliance with these requirements is regarded as unauthorised development and is enforceable under Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  My Department has been in contact with each of the relevant local authorities in which RPZs are located throughout the year, and has requested regular updates on the enforcement and implementation of the Short Term Letting Regulations.</p></reply>

Irish Water's charging policies, including in relation to connection charges, are subject to approval by the CRU, in its statutory role as the independent economic regulator of Irish Water. </p>  <p>  Part V of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, in particular sets out the CRU's responsibility for the determination of the charges, including connection charges, and charging arrangements, that apply to customers of Irish Water. The CRU determination on the appropriate charges and charging arrangements that apply to new network connections are set out in its detailed decision paper on Connection Charging available on its website at www.cru.ie.  My Department has no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  As part of Housing for All, the Government has committed to a range of actions as part of the pathway to address vacancy ensuring the efficient use of housing stock.  Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary concern of this Government and the new Housing for All Strategy outlines a multi-faceted approach to addressing this matter, including:   </p>  <p>  - A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market will ensure homes don&rsquo;t lie vacant.</p>  <p>  - Reform of the Fair Deal Scheme to remove disincentives to selling or renting unused homes. </p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. </p>  <p>  - A new Town Centre First policy, which will include approaches to utilising existing stock and new financial incentive mechanisms.</p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the vacant property tax and vacant site tax being pursued by the Department of Finance. </p></reply>

The Government, on foot of proposals made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, nominates officers for Ambassadorial posts. The nominated Ambassadors are subsequently appointed by the President and take up duty abroad following the receipt of <i>agr&eacute;ment</i>from the receiving state. Only serving civil servants are considered for ambassadorial assignments. </p><p>All currently serving Ambassadors are established career civil servants employed by my Department. All civil service grades are recruited through the Public Appointments Service or external competitions administered by my Department in accordance with the Code of Practice as set out by the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA). In considering the nomination of Ambassadors, a range of factors is taken into account including political, economic and trade priorities. In addition the management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge, relevant language skills, policy experience, consular experience, and other factors of the officers are taken into account as part of the assignment process. Officers submit a list of preferences for an overseas posting.  Ambassadors are paid on the same pay scales for all Civil Service employees for that grade. These pay scales are available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website. Additional allowances and costs (e.g. healthcare, school fees, transportation of goods) are paid by the Department depending on the conditions in the local county, based on Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction.</p><p>As requested, I have included the list of Irish Ambassadors broken down by location and grade. <table>    <tr>       <th>Mission </th>       <th>Surname </th>

The Uganda government has promised accountability. In December 2021, two soldiers were convicted for killing three people during this period, but further investigations remain outstanding.   </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with other EU Member States, has called on the Ugandan government to respect the freedoms and rights of all political actors and their supporters, and for full investigation of allegations of violations. Ireland has raised concerns about the November violence and the human rights situation in the country directly with Ugandan government interlocutors, including the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and directly with the President. </p>  <p>  I visited Uganda in October and heard from a broad range of civil society stakeholders and human rights leaders active in Uganda.  I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for their work and for civil society in Uganda. I also met with Uganda&rsquo;s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jeje Odongo.  Our discussions included challenges in relation to civil society space; evolving regional developments; and Ireland&rsquo;s support for the COVID-19 response in Uganda. In our high-level engagements and through the ongoing work of our Ambassador and the Embassy of Ireland to Uganda, Ireland will continue to raise issues of concern in relation to civil society space and human rights in Uganda with key stakeholders and at the highest levels of government. </p>  <p>  In mid-November, four civilians were killed and several dozen injured following two coordinated bomb attacks in Uganda's capital Kampala. The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan rebel group largely confined to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), are believed to be responsible for the attacks. In response, the Ugandan and DRC defence forces have launched joint military operations in eastern DRC targeted at the ADF. Ireland, alongside other EU Member States, is monitoring the situation closely. At the UN Security Council, Ireland has stressed that the joint military operations must ensure a strong focus on the protection of civilians and human rights. We have also emphasised the need for strong and effective communication with MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping force in the DRC, in relation to the ongoing operations.</p></reply>

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. The potential effect of the build-up on the security situation in the non-government controlled territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which border Russia, is also of concern.  It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Ukraine at United Nations Security Council meetings on Ukraine, including at Arria formula meetings. We have also stressed our non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, encouraged full, secure and unimpeded access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and called for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. </p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Ukraine at the Foreign Affairs Council on 13 December and, in my own remarks, I underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. In remarks after the Foreign Affairs Council, High Representative Borrell made clear that aggression against Ukraine, will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia. I and my counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council have dedicated significant time to the security situation in Ukraine this year, including through engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I also discussed these matters with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.</p></reply>

We are deeply conscious of the enduring suffering and hardship that survivors of Troubles-related violence bear, both North and South, and indeed in Britain and Europe.</p>  <p>  The Government established a Remembrance Commission in 2003, to administer a Scheme of Assistance and remembrance for victims of the Northern Ireland conflict, and their families, in this jurisdiction. The Commission continued this work until 2008. In administering the scheme, the Remembrance Commission, which operated independently of Government, funded Acknowledgement payments, Economic Hardship payments, Displacement payments and Medical payments for victims&rsquo; families and those who were seriously injured in Troubles-related incidents in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  Acknowledgement payments were paid to 309 applicants in respect of 109 victims killed in Troubles-related incidents in the South. Over the lifetime of the Commission from 2003 to 2008, &euro;3.87 million in funding was made available to individual victims and survivors of the Troubles, resident in this jurisdiction to acknowledge their suffering, and to address economic hardship and certain medical expenses.</p>  <p>  Funding for certain ongoing medical needs was also provided for those injured in Troubles-related attacks in this jurisdiction, and following the conclusion of the Commission, this continues to be provided through the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice has responsibility for victims&rsquo; issues and will certainly consider and respond to representations from people in the jurisdiction who want to raise views with her on this issue.

It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented &ndash; for the families and victims who have waited for too long. </p>  <p>  We have taken every opportunity in our regular engagements with the British Government, including at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) on 2 December, to set out this position. We have cautioned the British Government strongly against any unilateral action on this most sensitive of issues.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the BIIGC on 24 June, the Government joined the British Government and the political  parties in Northern Ireland in a process of engagement on these issues, with discussions beginning in July. The intention has been to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  As we have consistently stated, a statute of limitations as proposed by the UK Government in their command paper is not something the Government can support. There has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties. </p>  <p>  We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments. It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations.</p></reply>

The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927 to provide for the payment of pensions, allowances and gratuities in certain circumstances to members of the Defence Forces. The 1927 Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members.</p>  <p>  The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps.  The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  The Secretary of the Army Pensions Board is a civil servant in my Department.</p>  <p>  As disability returns are anonymous, my Department cannot provide a breakdown on the number of persons with a declared disability as requested by the Deputy. It should also be noted that there is no onus on an employee to declare a disability.  In 2020, 4.28% of the civil servants in my Department had declared a disability, and 6.15% of the civilian employees who are employed to support the operational capability of the Defence Forces and work in military installations.</p>  <p>  In compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, the Department of Defence has undertaken, where practicable, to promote and support the employment of people with disabilities.  The Department continues to operate in a non-discriminatory environment in accordance with the Equality Acts and aims to ensure that the principles of employment equality are implemented in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience. </p></reply>

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961. The range of actions taken to date to recognise the bravery of the men stationed in Jadotville in 1961 include:</p>  <p>  -  A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.  </p>  <p>  -  Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.  </p>  <p>  -  In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.  </p>  <p>  -  A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  </p>  <p>  -  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, it was decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  -  On 13th June 2017, the Government decided, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place in Custume Barracks, Athlone on 2nd December 2017.  It is from Custume Barracks that &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.  The &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; has the word &ldquo;Jadotville&rdquo; depicted on the clasp of the medal and the medal ribbon represents a combination of an Irish tricolour and the United Nations Operation in Congo (ONUC) mission medal. The medal depicts a warrior of the ancient Fianna with sword and shield. To the left is a reproduction of the Irish overseas flash. Surrounding the central motif are the words &ldquo;Cosaint Chalma&rdquo; (Valiant Defence) and &ldquo;Misneach&rdquo; (Courage). The reverse contains a unique unit identification representing A Coy, 35 Cathlan &Eacute;ireannach (Irish Battalion). </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.    </p>  <p>  The Independent Review Group completed its research in July and has submitted its report to the Chief of Staff, as the convening authority.  The work of the Independent Review Group has now concluded.   </p>  <p>  The report, which was published in full, is substantial and makes a number of recommendations in respect of the issue of award of medals, honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans and in respect of veterans affairs.  </p>  <p>  The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.   </p>  <p>  A judicial review is under way at present regarding a recommendation of the IRG report relating to the convening of a Military Board to consider the award of medals. Given that the matter is now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for equipment under the scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum.  It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.  Equipment may only be provided where medical and/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this.  An assessment indicating that equipment would achieve improvement in performance is not sufficient since this could be true in the case of any child.</p>  <p>  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010/2013.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at ncse.ie/seno-contact-information.</p>  <p>  Resources provided to schools also include additional training for teachers who support children with special educational needs, through the Special Education Support Service (SESS).  </p>  <p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) is part of the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, along with the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf/hard of hearing and for children who are blind/visually impaired (VTSVHI). </p>  <p>  The Support Service provides advice and support to schools on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, providing in-school support for teachers and continuing professional development for teachers with additional training needs. The Support Service continues to update current CPD courses and design new CPD courses in response to the needs of teachers. </p>  <p>  Schools can apply for CPD courses directly to the NCSE on their online application process at www.sess.ie/ncsesupport.</p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals.</p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  Discussions on these elements continue at present and should agreement on an overall package be reached then F&oacute;rsa would have to ballot their members and an implementation process would then begin if the ballot was passed. </p>  <p>  I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

Many of these projects would have included PE hall or GP room provision, though the detail requested by the Deputy is not readily available.</p>  <p>  However, I can confirm that there are currently 377 schools (338 projects) listed on the Large Scale Capital Programme which would be expected to provide new PE halls at post-primary level (where none exist already) or GP halls at primary level (where none exist already).</p>  <p>  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision.  The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. There will be a rolling 5 year funding envelope will be updated annually for the period 2026 to 2030 within the Government&rsquo;s overall NDP funding envelope of &euro;136 billion in exchequer capital (&euro;165 billion total capital including non-Exchequer) and will facilitate building a modern and sustainable school infrastructure.</p>  <p>  This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. The strengthened focus on refurbishment of existing school stock will have different strands which includes PE build and modernisation programme which will enable students in post-primary schools to have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision, particularly also in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject. Enhanced and modernised PE facilities will also provide important amenities for local communities.  This planned investment in the existing school stock will also incorporate the provision of ancillary accommodation such as GP rooms at primary level.  The specific accommodation needs of Special Schools will additionally form part of this modernisation programme.</p></reply>

The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional school accommodation (ASA) where required. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly. The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation. The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.  The second half of the National Development Plan will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.</p></reply>

The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health. </p>  <p>  The Framework for Junior Cycle focuses on active and collaborative learning. It gives greater flexibility and autonomy to schools in terms of subject selection, and new short courses, to tailor a student&rsquo;s learning to achieve better outcomes for that student. Students are able to study up to 10 subjects for certification through the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.</p>  <p>  We have a dedicated cohort of Geography teachers in our post-primary schools, who are promoting the inclusion of their subject within programmes provided to students by their schools. Through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 the curricular significance of Geography has been retained and given a new impetus across the Junior Cycle curriculum. </p></reply>

A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.</p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p></reply>

This resulted in the biggest ever uptake of the programme during the summer period with the overall number of schools participating rising by 72% and the number of students by 65% over 2020. This is in addition to the supplementary programme run earlier in the year which had over 14,000 applicants.   The school based element was made up of an expanded Special Class and Special School Programme, a new inclusion programme at Primary level and an expanded inclusion programme at Post Primary level.  An expanded literacy and numeracy camp in DEIS Primary schools was also part of part of the summer programme for 2021.  An expanded home-based programme was available to eligible pupils whose schools were not offering a programme.</p>  <p>  For the school-based element of the programme all fully completed claim forms were paid on or before 7th October 2021.  2,587 teachers have been paid across the Special Class and Special School programme and the inclusion programme at Primary and Post-Primary Level. There were also 3,593 SNA processed and paid for these programmes.</p>  <p>  The number of individual teachers who received payment on the DEIS Literacy and Numeracy camp at primary level is not currently available and this will be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In 2021, there was a significant increase in the number and complexity of claims involved and while the majority were paid by the 28 October 2021, with the remainder paid in subsequent payrolls. Claims are processed and paid when all outstanding queries are fully resolved. Where there are outstanding issues, claimants have been contacted directly with a view to resolving as quickly as possible for processing on the subsequent payroll dates.  As of the next payroll date of 23 December, 6,731 teachers have been paid for their participation on the home-based element of the programme and in addition 1,969 SNA have been paid.  There are 8 further claims on the home-based programme due for payment on 06 January and currently a small number of claims, 27 in total,  to be resolved with outstanding queries. My Department&rsquo;s staff will continue to liaise with the tutors in question to resolve these issues.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p><p>A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.</p><p>The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: The urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my department.  The school meals (local projects) scheme provides funding towards the provision of food to schools and organisations.  </p><p>Funding under the school meals (local projects) scheme can be provided for breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, hot meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided e.g. &euro;1.40 per child per day where a cold lunch club is being provided, &euro;1.90 per child per day where a dinner club is being provided and &euro;2.90 per child per day where a Hot Meal club is being provided.  Dinner clubs provide a hot meal, but are different from the Hot Meals clubs, in that they tend to be provided by schools with onsite cooking facilities whereas food for Hot Meals clubs is cooked offsite and either delivered hot or reheated in the school.</p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application and to administer the programme in accordance to the guidelines.  </p><p>In recent years entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme. </p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools.</p><p>As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p><p>Budget 2021 provided an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p><p>The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one School for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area.</p><p>Budget 2022 is providing for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000.</p><p>The DEIS programme serves over 105,000 pupils at primary level and over 75,000 at post primary level.</p><p>The number of DEIS primary students in receipt of hot school meals is contained in table 1 of the attached tabular statement. This includes children from the additional 35,000 announced in Budget 2021, where the school was in a position to commence provision of hot school meals prior to the end of the 2020/2021 academic year. There are no secondary school students in receipt of hot school meals as it is aimed at primary schools with no onsite cooking facilities. </p><p>The number of DEIS primary and secondary students in receipt of cold school meals (cold lunch) is contained in table 2 of the attached tabular statement.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Number of DEIS primary and secondary students in receipt of hot school meals for academic year 2020/2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Primary Students</th>       <th>17,236</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary Students</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Number of DEIS primary and secondary students in receipt of cold school meals (lunch) for academic year 2020/2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Primary Students</th>       <th>87,827</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Secondary Students</td>       <td>30,344</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Department officials also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p><p>At the start of April this year, agreement was reached between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Social Protection on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue.  </p><p>Since that time, discussions on these proposals took place between my Department and the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors, in consultation with other relevant Government Departments; the Department of Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance.  </p><p>Department officials wrote to both SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa recently setting out the terms of a full and final settlement which will involve a once off ex-gratia payment to CE supervisors and assistant supervisors on reaching pension age.  The total value of the financial package now on the table is in excess of &euro;24 million. </p><p>The scheme will apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors who have retired since 2008, subject to qualifying criteria, and has the potential to benefit up to 2,200 existing and former CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors. </p><p>As this proposal is currently under consideration by the representative unions, CE supervisors and assistant supervisors should raise concerns or issues that may arise, with their union.

A key feature of the introduction of the reduced rates was that subsequent participation in full-time education and training would lead to an increased rate in payment.  As a result, if a young jobseeker on a reduced Jobseeker's Allowance payment participates on an education or training programme they receive the maximum weekly personal payment of &euro;203.  Where a young jobseeker participates on the new Work Placement Experience Programme their weekly rate of payment will increase to &euro;306. I have provided that these weekly rates of payment will increase by &euro;5 from January 2022.</p>  <p>  A person aged between 18 and 24 is exempted from the reduced rates if they are living independently of the family home and are in receipt of state housing supports such as rent supplement, housing assistance payment (HAP), Rent Accommodation Scheme (RAS), local authority or living permanently in accommodation provided by a local authority approved housing body. </p>  <p>  Reduced rates also do not apply to Jobseekers under 25 years of age who have qualified children or those who were in care of the HSE immediately before they turned 18. </p>  <p>  My Department engages in an inter-agency response to homelessness through its engagement with Tusla, the HSE and non-Government organisations to provide the necessary support to vulnerable people including young people who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations. </p>  <p>  The reduced Jobseeker's rates apply to those who are experiencing homelessness.  However, young people in these circumstances engage with the Department's Community Welfare Service where they can access additional financial support under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.  These supports may include supplements or exceptional needs payments which can be provided to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources. A case-by case approach is taken given the complexity of the issues that may be involved. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme being applied for. </p><p>In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at class S.  Where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied, this class of PRSI gives access to the following benefits: </p><p>- Adoptive Benefit, </p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory),</p><p>- Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed),</p><p>- Maternity Benefit,</p><p>- Parent's Benefit,</p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension),  </p><p>- Paternity Benefit,</p><p>- State Pension (Contributory),</p><p>- Treatment Benefit, and</p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p><p>The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are - </p><p>- Carer's Benefit,</p><p>- Health and Safety Benefit, </p><p>- Illness Benefit, and</p><p>- Occupational Injuries Benefits. </p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure.  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  It has been available to the self-employed since its introduction in March 2020.  Expenditure on the enhanced Illness Benefit is expected to be in the region of &euro;100 million for 2021.</p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to giving consideration to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including to the State pension system, improvements in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits. </p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>To satisfy the household composition criteria an applicant may live alone or only with:</p><p>- a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren); (if the qualified spouse is in receipt of half rate carers, in addition to the IQA payment, they may qualify for fuel allowance, subject to a means test) <b>or</b></p><p>- a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to the allowance in their own right <b>or</b></p><p>- a person who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of providing full-time care and attention to the fuel allowance applicant or their qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren) <b>or</b></p><p>- a person receiving pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), a person receiving short-term jobseeker's allowance (JA) or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) - i.e., less than 391 days for JA and less than 15 months/456 days for SWA).</p><p>Fuel allowance is not payable if an applicant lives with any person, including a family member that is not covered by the criteria outlined.</p><p>Any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for fuel allowance in the manner outlined by the Deputy would change the targeted nature of the scheme and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.

The Scheme will include financial payments and a form of enhanced medical card for eligible applicants and will be based on proof of residency in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for a defined period of time. </p>  <p>  According to the proposals for the Scheme, any person who was resident as a child in a Mother and Baby or County Home Institution for a period of six months or more (and who did not receive redress in respect of that institution under the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme) will be eligible for a financial payment and an enhanced medical card. As mentioned, eligibility is based on proof of residency and it is the intention that the payment will rise based on the time spent in an institution. Full details of the proposals for the Scheme, including a table which sets out the payment rates agreed by Government for inclusion in the Scheme, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website (www.gov.ie/en/publication/0c637-mother-and-baby-institutions-payment-scheme/).</p>  <p>  I have been given Government approval to bring forward legislative proposals on the basis of the agreed proposals and work has commenced in my Department on the Heads of Bill required to establish the Scheme. Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the necessary preparatory work has been completed, the Scheme will be open for applications. I hope that this will be possible by the end of 2022. </p></reply>

Earlier this year, my colleague Minister Rabbitte announced an intention to develop an Autism Innovation Strategy with the aim of launching it in 2022. In Budget 2022, Minister Rabbitte and I secured &euro;100,000 for the design and implementation of the Autism Innovation Strategy, and for awareness raising around it.</p>  <p>  In line with our commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is critical that the Autism Innovation Strategy be informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives. As such, the first step in the development of the Strategy will be a consultation on its design, which I expect to occur early in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Autism Innovation Strategy will be aligned to Ireland's existing national policy frameworks which address and respond to issues that affect all persons with disabilities, including those with autism. These strategies are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities (CES). </p>  <p>  The Innovation Strategy will compliment these structures by focusing on the specific challenges that face persons with autism, and will seek to break down bespoke barriers by focusing on practical and tangible actions and outcomes.</p></reply>

Youthreach Co-ordinators and Resource Persons have their own terms and conditions and are a separate grade to teachers.  Accordingly, they do not require to be registered with the Teaching Council nor does Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act, 2001 apply to Youthreach Centres as they do not fall within the definition of a recognised school. </p><p>The Youthreach programme provides a range of supports for learners, including work placement, career guidance, personal counselling as well as informal support from staff.  It requires staff who are flexible, multi-disciplined and experienced.  While relevant qualifications are desirable, no qualifications are specified for staff working in the programme. This is intended to give Education and Training Boards (ETBs) maximum flexibility to recruit staff with the combination of personal qualities and professional skills most likely to meet the often complex needs of participating learners. Teachers are also employed in Youthreach and it is a matter for each ETB to decide on the staff required for the programme being delivered in their Youthreach centres.  The length of the programme is longer than the school year, but this is to ensure the continuity in the lives of the young person and provide that ongoing support needed over a longer period. </p><p>The roles of the Youthreach Co-ordinator and Youthreach Resource Person were designed very much with the programmes structure in mind. Template contracts of employment for these roles, as set out in Circular 12/03, were negotiated and agreed by all stakeholders.  The latest pay scales (with effect from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2021 for these grades are set out in Circular  051/2021 Revision of salaries of certain grades other than Teachers and SNAs employed by ETBs, which is available at www.gov.ie/en/circular/4ed38-revision-of-salaries-of-certain-grades-other-than-teachers-and-snas-employed-by-etbs-with-effect-from-1-october-2021</p><p>A union representing Youthreach Co-ordinators and Youthreach Resource Persons has submitted a claim in respect of both grades. Officials from my Department and the Department of Education are engaging with the trade union on this claim under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. This is the most appropriate place for that engagement to happen.</p><p>I can also confirm that consideration of future staffing and the development of a staffing framework for the further education and training system (which includes Youthreach) is a component of <i>Future FET-Transforming Learning, the Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024. </i></p></reply>

Fundamentally the challenge is one of supply, and increasing the availability of both public and private sector student accommodation will be necessary to meet with this demand. Since the launch of <i>Rebuilding Ireland </i>in 2016 more than 11,000 student bedspaces have been built, the majority of which have been in the private sector and I have acknowledged the need for the State to play its part. There are a number of actions underway to assist higher education institutions in increasing their student accommodation supply. </p><p>Housing For All contains a commitment to supporting technological universities in developing purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists. The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future contained a commitment to work with higher education institutions to ensure that more accommodation is built on and off campus, using cost-rental and other models.</p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan and the most recent guidance on the current approach advocate and support contingency planning to ensure that institutions remain flexible and adaptable in response to changes in the public health environment.</p>  <p>My Department does not determine sector specific matters at this level. However, in order to address concerns, I met with management, staff and student representatives on the 19th   November and the issue was discussed.</p>  <p>  Due to the diversity and autonomy of our higher education institutions, and the broad range of activities they undertake and the different contexts and requirements applicable to examinations, it was agreed that a uniform or one size fits all approach would not be appropriate across the whole of higher education or indeed the tertiary sector more generally.</p>  <p>  Management bodies confirmed that they are actively looking at a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe, and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed. It was also pointed out that there are some examinations &ndash; such as those related to external accreditation - which are challenging to change to an online format at short notice.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the meeting was that Individual higher education institutions will assess the appropriate approach to examinations, taking into account the significant contextual factors that arise in different instances and that individuals who cannot sit exams due to Covid-19 concerns will be offered alternatives.</p>  <p>  Since that meeting in November, the sector has confirmed that many institutions have now commenced their end of semester examinations, adopting approaches to their examinations on the basis of risk assessment and the use of precautionary measures as agreed.</p>  <p>  In instances where examinations are being held in person, institutions are ensuring that these are taking place in environments in line with public health guidance and at a significantly lower capacity than normal. Procedures are in place to accommodate students who cannot sit an exam as a result of Covid impacting either themselves or close contacts.</p>  <p>  The sector continues to carefully consider the balance between the measures, the risk assessments and to engage with staff and students in planning for examinations. The Department has been assured public health officials in HSE West have been working with NUI Galway and it is satisfied NUI Galway is working within its guidelines. </p>  <p>  In all instances public health must remain a priority and I know that there will be a continuing focus on the evolving and often quickly changing public health situation overall. I have also recently announced a &euro;9 million fund to enable institutions provide free antigen tests to students. The use of these tests can provide an additional layer of protection, to prevent onward transmission and help to protect students, our third level sector and the community at large.</p></reply>

A breakdown by parent ETB is provided in the attachment.</p>  <p>  In addition to those waiting for assignment, 3,143 craft apprentices have been assigned to commence a phase of off-the-job training during December and January.  Those who have been waiting the longest are being prioritised.  Registrations to craft apprenticeships remain strong with 5,934 craft apprentices registered year to date, and these apprentices must also be accommodated.  </p>  <p>  SOLAS, the HEA and education and training providers are continuing to work to ensure that craft apprentices are facilitated to complete their apprenticeship in as rapid a manner as is possible.  In addition to investment in increased capacity across providers of craft apprentice off-the-job training, a number of reform measures have been agreed and are being implemented for the purposes of clearing the lists.  These include changed delivery structures for Phase 2 off-the-job training which is facilitating a third intake of apprentices per annum and an opt-in rapid employer assessment which is being piloted at Phase 7 (on-the-job) for those apprentices who have completed Phase 6 and who have spent more than four years in their apprenticeship. </p>  <p>  Further measures are being explored within the context of ensuring that all learning outcomes and quality assurance procedures remain in place to ensure that the integrity of the end qualification is maintained.</p></reply>

They consist of four periods of on-the-job training interspersed with three periods of off-the-job training. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in either ETB Training Centres, Institutes of Technology or Technological Universities, during this time craft apprentices receive a training allowance payment, the level of which is determined with reference to the relevant sectoral payment agreements. </p>  <p>  COVID-related public health measures impacted on face to face training in a number of ways.  Each of which had a different implication for the level of expenditure on off-the-job training allowances paid to craft apprentices. </p>  <p>  For periods of complete closure of face-to-face training, those apprentices who had been scheduled to attend off-the-job training were retained on the off-the-job training phase and continued to receive a training allowance during this period.  The retention of apprentices on Phase 2, 4 or 6, allowed for apprentices to engage with the restricted level of theory based training and remote assessment which could be delivered, given the practical course content, as these became available in 2020 and early 2021.  It also provided surety for apprentices in relation to income during the closure of construction sites in early 2020. </p>  <p>  When face-to-face training was allowed, it operated at 50% - 60% normal capacity until September 2021 to ensure adherence to public health distancing guidance.  The level of expenditure on training allowance payments was therefore reduced in accordance with the reduced system capacity during this time.  </p>  <p>  Additional capacity coming on-stream from September 2021, combined with the potential for apprentices to receive an increased training allowance will be reflected in total expenditure for 2021.  Apprentices are not penalised on their training allowances for operational issues that may arise. In circumstances where there has been a delay by SOLAS due to lack of available provision in the offer of a training place the apprentice may be entitled to payment of one phase rate higher e.g. on Phase 2 such apprentices may be paid the Phase 4 rate. On Phase 4 the apprentice may be paid the Phase 6 rate and on Phase 6 apprentices may be paid the fourth year rate. </p>  <p>  The total saving declared in 2020 for the Apprenticeship programme was &euro;23.2m.

My Department assumed responsibility for Part 5 reporting in 2021 and submitted its report to the National Disability Authority earlier this year in respect of the 2020 returns for the public bodies under its aegis. Those returns confirm that the overall compliance rate for the aegis bodies under my Department in 2020, in terms of the percentage of employees with a disability, was 4.97%. This is an improvement on the 2019 figure of 4.15%.  </p><p>These figures confirm that the majority of bodies under the aegis of my Department are currently exceeding the 3% target and are well placed to meet the new public sector duty of 6% proposed under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021. </p><p>I believe that my Department can play a leading role in terms of improving opportunities for people with disabilities. Under the current National Access Plan (2015-21), the 8% target set for new entrants to higher education has been exceeded with 12.2% of new entrants in 2019/20 declaring a disability. I intend to publish the next National Access Plan (2022-26) in early 2022 which will set new ambitious targets for students with disabilities.</p><p>I have recently published a new Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-25. The expanding range of opportunities available within apprenticeship, as well as changing work practices in traditional areas, provide a step towards increasing opportunity for persons with a disability and other traditionally under-represented groups. Under the Action Plan I want to ensure that there is clear information on existing supports for persons with a disability and that these are made visible to employers and prospective apprentices through www.apprenticeship.ie. Employers who demonstrate examples of good practice will be acknowledged through initiatives such as a diversity badge. I also intend to establish an apprentice bursary/support scheme to fund up to 100 apprentices per year who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disadvantage and who are from target groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma.</p><p>My Department will continue to play its part in improving opportunities for persons with disabilities to engage in education, undertake apprenticeships and gain meaningful employment. </p></reply>

The core component for the PhD students of their research programmes will always be the advancement of knowledge through original research, and this must remain the primary focus of the activity of postgraduate research students.</p><p>In addition to skills related to the research process itself, the National Framework for Doctoral Education recognises the role of doctoral education in developing generic and transferable skills, as an integral objective of the training. As part of this, PhD students may participate in academic support activities to develop generic and transferable skills. </p><p>A range of activities can be included under academic support activities, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring. Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising, monitoring student projects, and correcting projects, notebooks or essays and will vary according to School/Discipline. This will vary according to the particular school and discipline. Where such activities are performed, they are commonly part of the student&rsquo;s terms and are considered a valuable activity supporting skills and career development, including for academic positions. PhD students may contribute to academic support activities often at a level of up to five hours per week, in the course of their studies.</p><p>The delivery of academic support activities by graduate students in a higher education institution is a matter for the institution concerned reflecting their independent self-governed status.  It is important that the allocation and conduct of such work is undertaken in accordance with the objectives of the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills Statement in enabling the development of key skills and competencies for postgraduate students.  </p><p>Achieving a greater degree of consistency throughout the system is an ambition of this department. The next National R&amp;amp;I strategy is currently under development and will reflect themes relating to positioning Ireland as a leader in: supporting rewarding careers in research; facilitating a research culture that encourages the flow of talent and ideas across an R&amp;amp;I system that attracts, retains and celebrates diversity of people and careers.</p><p>  Department officials have been engaging with the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association to undertake further examination of issues in relation to academic support activities of PhD students, including looking at international practice, in conjunction with members of the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education. </p><p>This collaborative work with my officials, the representative bodies and the doctoral forum is progressing the issue and, building on this, I intend to write to higher education institutions shortly setting out my expectations for progress ahead of the next academic year. </p></reply>

Issues arise for communities where vehicles are used on public, open spaces such as in housing estates, playing pitches or in public parks. </p><p>  I can inform the Deputy that I chair the Anti-Social Behaviour Forum within my Department. One of the tasks of the Forum was to deliver proposals to Government for a community based approach to tackling this problem. While the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fundamental to addressing the misuse of scramblers and other vehicles, it was also highlighted to the Forum that engagement with communities and raising awareness are just as important.  </p><p>  Raising awareness encompasses educating younger people of dangers to themselves and to others in using such vehicles and highlighting the dangers to parents who are considering buying such vehicles for their children. The Forum explored the opportunities of intervention and diversion from this type of activity. </p><p>  Earlier this year, the Department of Justice invited applications for funding from Youth Diversion Projects who would act as the focal point for local consortiums for the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in the anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.</p><p>  These funding provisions have so far enabled eight Youth Diversion Projects to obtain funding to work with young people involved in the misuse of these vehicles. A total of ten Youth Diversion Projects have submitted applications to the Department, though there have been two joint applications, leaving the total number of projects funded at eight. </p><p>Seven of these projects are based in Dublin with one in Limerick. </p><p>The projects will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority. </p><p>Based on experience with existing initiatives, it is envisaged that the local authority partner is best placed to assist with the provision of tracks and related facilities.

It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, together with the creation of alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. </p><p>  The Department of Justice would welcome additional applications from other Youth Diversion Projects to support the development of additional local scrambler initiatives. </p></reply>

Detention of a person refused entry to the State is only undertaken as a last resort. There is a statutory obligation to return a person refused entry permission as soon as is practicable. Non-custodial measures, such as a requirement to report to a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station or a requirement to reside in a specified place, are widely used as alternatives to detention.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 2003 (as amended by the International protection Act, 2015) contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused permission to enter. </p>  <p>  It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. It also provides that a person may be detained for a period not exceeding 12 hours at the airport or port from which the person is due to depart.</p>  <p>  Work has been completed on a new Block F in Cloverhill remand prison which is intended to be used to accommodate people detained for immigration purposes and ensure they can be housed separately from people on remand. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic required significant measures within the Irish Prison Service (IPS) to manage and control infection risk, and it was necessary to re-purpose Block F as an isolation unit for those prisoners who have, or are suspected of having, the virus. It is intended that when the pandemic is over, Block F will revert to its original intended use, subject to the availability of staff and the impact on resources. While this will address the situation in the immediate term, work is also proceeding on the consideration of a longer-term sustainable and compliant solution.</p>  <p>  The former Transaer building at Dublin airport has been refitted and now contains the new Dublin Airport Garda station and additional office facilities occupied by GNIB. GNIB took up residence in the office facility in July 2019 and the local Garda&iacute; moved into the new Garda Station in December 2019. The Garda station contains four single person cells and two additional detention rooms. While the building works have completed, the cells have not been fully commissioned at this time and outstanding matters are being addressed by the authorities.</p>  <p>  It is intended that GNIB will detain persons refused leave to land, overnight at the Dublin Airport Garda station when the detention facilities are fully commissioned.</p>  <p>  The Justice Plan 2021 contains a commitment to review the policy of holding immigration detainees in prisons. Work is continuing to complete this action. </p></reply>

The General Scheme sets out the framework and legislative basis for the establishment of a new independent, statutory body &ndash; the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (&ldquo;the Authority&rdquo;) &ndash; to implement a robust regulatory and licensing regime for the gambling sector.  </p>  <p>  I have written to the Joint Oireachtas Committee referring the General Scheme for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Authority is being established to focus on public safety and well-being, cover gambling online and in person, and will have the powers to regulate advertising, gambling websites and apps. </p>  <p>  My Department has established a Programme Board to ensure that the legislation and the operational preparations are progressed in parallel so that the Authority commences operations as soon as possible after enactment. There is a pathway mapped for this legislation progressing, which will facilitate the Authority being established and operational in 2023.</p>  <p>  The Authority, once established, will have a board and appointed CEO management / governance structure. As part of the preparations to establish the Authority, a CEO designate is currently being recruited.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have recently sanctioned the recruitment of the CEO Designate of the Gambling Regulatory Authority, and this process is being managed by the Public Appointments Service. The position will be advertised by way of open public competition, in line with general PAS procedures and public service recruitment principles. All eligible candidates, including those from outside the jurisdiction, are encouraged to apply for the position.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, &euro;500,000 has been allocated to meet the costs of appointing the CEO Designate as well as non-pay related costs in establishing the Authority. This is added to the initial seed funding of &euro;200,000 in Budget 2021. This &euro;700,000 will cover start-up costs including accommodation and professional services.  </p></reply>

The Government is very conscious of the commitment to deliver effective data protection regulation and protection of the data privacy rights of EU citizens, which is critical to the development and growth of our digital economy. In dialogue with the Data Protection Commission, and with other relevant Government Departments, my Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that the Commission continues to have the resources required to fulfil its important, statutory obligations.</p>  <p>  To this effect, there has been a year-on-year increase in funding for the Commission over the last five budgetary years aligned with staffing numbers increasing from 110 at the end of 2018 to an expected 190 by the end of this year. In Budget 2022, the Data Protection Commission vote has received an increased allocation of &euro;4.1 million which represents a 21% increase on 2021. This brings the total allocation for the Commission to &euro;23 million in 2022 &ndash; a six-fold increase compared to 2015. </p>  <p>  Recognising the expanding breadth of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory role, its mission to safeguard data protection rights, and the increasing demands, this increased allocation to the Commission in 2022 will enable the recruitment of additional specialist and technical staff and address the increasing case load and complexity of cases being faced by the Commission.  </p>  <p>  Under the Data Protection Act 2018, provision is made that the Government may determine that the Commission could consist of up to three members. I have asked my officials to consider the matter of appointing additional commissioners to the Data Protection Commission. If such a recommendation were to be made, I would intend to bring that recommendation to Government for a decision.</p></reply>

In addition, the impact of the new Omicron variant is still unknown. Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team gave some consideration to the issues arising for those people that cannot receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons as part of its discussions on the 18th October 2021 on the continuing response to COVID-19 and the extension of Covid Pass arrangements.

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. </p><p>As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most scoliosis cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p><p>More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p><p>In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services. </p><p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Waiting List Action Plan 2022. In addition the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund.</p><p>Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p><p>In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy regarding the creation of dedicated teams to deal exclusively with scoliosis procedures, and the number and grade of extra staff required to meet current and future requirements in respect of scoliosis, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.</p><p>Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p><p>If the NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

ME/CFS is characterised by severe fatigue accompanied by a range of other symptoms. It is also a fluctuating condition in which a person's symptoms can change unpredictably in nature and severity over time. </p>  <p>  As a result, clinical assessment and the design of care plans need to be tailored to the individual patient. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care by General Practitioners, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. The challenge in relation to ME/CFS is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients attending different Consultants for management of symptoms as they arise. The General Practitioner (GP) is regarded as best placed to refer patients, if appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive, on behalf of the State, does operate two schemes which assist citizens with their medication costs. These are the Drugs Payment Scheme and the General Medical Services Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The maximum payable under the Drugs Payment Scheme will be further reduced to &euro;100 per month from 1 January 2022. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. </p>  <p>  As this question also relates to a service matter, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. </p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work, in particular in Model 4 hospitals. This situation is to remain under review. </p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. </p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents. This information shows the number of patients on outpatient (OPD) waiting lists by hospital in County Cork and the number of patients on inpatient and daycase/elective procedure waiting lists (IPDC) by hospital in County Cork.  This information is also available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm  </p><p><b>Total number of patients on inpatient waiting lists (IPDC) by hospital in County Cork by Wait Time Band as at 25/11/2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Time band</th>       <th>0-6 Months</th>       <th>6-12 Months</th>       <th>12-18 Months</th>       <th>18 Months +</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bantry Hospital</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>79</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork University Hospital</td>       <td>650</td>       <td>241</td>       <td>158</td>       <td>256</td>       <td>1,303</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork Maternity University Hospital</td>       <td>233</td>       <td>137</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>185</td>       <td>601</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mallow General Hospital</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>191</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mercy University Hospital</td>       <td>748</td>       <td>247</td>       <td>109</td>       <td>231</td>       <td>1,336</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>1,809</td>       <td>415</td>       <td>207</td>       <td>138</td>       <td>2,569</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>3,639</td>       <td>1,076</td>       <td>535</td>       <td>831</td>       <td>6,079</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Total number of patients on Outpatient waiting lists (OPD) by hospital in County Cork by Wait Time Band as at 25/11/2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Time band</th>       <th>0-6 Months</th>       <th>6-12 Months</th>       <th>12-18 Months</th>       <th>18 Months +</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bantry Hospital</td>       <td>607</td>       <td>289</td>       <td>230</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>1,352</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork University Hospital</td>       <td>14,597</td>       <td>7,441</td>       <td>4,849</td>       <td>10,567</td>       <td>37,455</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork Maternity University Hospital</td>       <td>1,481</td>       <td>521</td>       <td>112</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>2,133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mallow General Hospital</td>       <td>1,722</td>       <td>598</td>       <td>312</td>       <td>278</td>       <td>2911</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mercy University Hospital</td>       <td>3,029</td>       <td>1,125</td>       <td>927</td>       <td>2,530</td>       <td>7,610</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td>9,658</td>       <td>3,743</td>       <td>2,339</td>       <td>7,525</td>       <td>23,262</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>31,094</td>       <td>13,717</td>       <td>8,769</td>       <td>21,145</td>       <td>74,723</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.</p>  <p>  On the 13th December, the NIAC recommended that the interval between the primary vaccine series and booster dose should be reduced to three months. In making its latest recommendations, NIAC has reiterated the need for booster vaccines to be offered to those in previously recommended groups before progression to the younger age cohorts.</p>  <p>  The NIAC previously recommended that a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine (irrespective of whether the primary vaccination course was of an mRNA or adenoviral vector) be offered to those aged 50 years and older, aged 16-59 years with underlying conditions, all residents in Long Term Healthcare Facilities and healthcare workers. I have accepted this advice and the HSE has made the necessary arrangements to operationalise these recommendations with the booster rollout now underway. </p>  <p>  The NIAC has also recommended a booster of an mRNA vaccine be offered to persons aged 16-49 years in descending order by age e.g., by 10 year age cohorts with the exception of COVID-19 vaccine Janssen recipients who can be offered a booster vaccine in parallel with those aged 30-39 years.

The area also has a high migrant health population living in overcrowded accommodation and quarantine accommodation.</p><p>It is important to state that all these cohorts have specific challenges and that they need individualised supports to be put in place if they are Covid positive, as they cannot isolate in their existing accommodation on public health grounds.</p><p>The HSE has advised that there is still a very significant ongoing demand for isolation in this facility and that it will be maintained as a Covid Isolation Facility for the coming winter period.</p><p>The HSE has assured me that the use of this facility as a Covid-19 response is being reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with national guidance.</p><p>I am happy to confirm that the HSE remain committed to enhancing the residential addiction services in this area including the reopening of the Keltoi facility once it is no longer required as part of the Covid-19 response.</p><p>It is vital that individuals receiving rehabilitation services from Keltoi are supported to continue their recovery path.

The Committee consists of a cross-sector membership from the statutory, community and voluntary sector, as well as clinical and academic expertise. </p><p>The Department of Health completed and published the mid-term review of the actions in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery.  Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025 were identified. These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan 2021-2025. </p><p>The oversight structures have been revised to drive the implementation of the strategic priorities for 2021-2025.Strategic implementation groups (SIGs) are being established to support the delivery of the strategic priorities and to reinforce cross-agency collaboration.  The National Oversight Committee is being streamlined and includes the chairs of the newly established SIGs.  The inter-agency approach involving a partnership between statutory, community and voluntary bodies remains central to the strategy, as does strengthening the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem.  The Department is putting in place a process to nominate members of the strategic implementation groups</p><p>I believe that the new structures will strengthen the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in developing national policy. I am also providing independent leadership to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders and involving service users to provide insights from the lived experience of drug and alcohol addiction.</p><p>Previous and new membership of the NOC, is set out in the table.</p><p><b>National Oversight Committee</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Sector</th>       <th>Body</th>       <th>pre review</th>       <th>post review</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Health </td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Health Service Executive</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Dept of An Taoiseach</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Health Research Board </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Justice</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Irish Prison Service</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Probation Service</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Revenue Customs Service</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Children and Youth Affairs / TUSLA</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Education and Skills</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Social Protection</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Statutory</td>       <td>Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community</td>       <td>Community rep</td>       <td>2</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community</td>       <td>Family support </td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Community</td>       <td>Service user rep</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Voluntary Sector</td>       <td>Voluntary Drug Treatment Network</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Task Force</td>       <td>Local DATF Chairs Network</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Task Force</td>       <td>Local DATF Coordinators Network</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Task Force</td>       <td>Regional DATF Chairs Network</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Task Force</td>       <td>Regional DATF Coordinators Network</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ministerial Appointees</td>       <td></td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chairpersons of 6 SIG</td>       <td>chair person for each of the 6 SIG</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Subcommittee</td>       <td>Chair of EWET subcommittee</td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Subcommittee</td>       <td>Research Subcommittee </td>       <td></td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td></td>       <td>31</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These include </p><p>- wearing of face masks (can be removed for consumption of refreshments)</p><p>- ensuring indoor spaces are well ventilated</p><p>- maintaining adequate social distancing (two metres where possible)</p><p>- covering coughs and sneezes and washing our hands </p><p>- not attending meetings if a person has symptoms and getting tested</p><p>The specific number attending groups or programmes should be determined by the capacity of the venue to ensure social distancing and should be reduced accordingly in smaller venues. </p><p>The difficulties in implementing the EU Digital COVID Certificate(COVID-19 pass) for attendance at support groups and programmes are recognised.

The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. </p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways. </p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion &ndash; estimated by NWIHP to be in the range of 50% to 70% &ndash; of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. </p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;2m was provided to the HSE to commence Phase One of the roll-out in 2020 and this was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, Cork University Maternity Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. These four Hubs are currently operational.</p>  <p>  Additional funding was made available in Budget 2021 to enable the continuation of Phase One this year, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, one located within the Saolta Hospital Group, at University Hospital Galway, and one within the University of Limerick Hospital Group, at Nenagh General Hospital. Work is well underway in relation to the recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of these two Hubs.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of 2022, will result in operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced, which will allow for a robust regulatory framework to be put in place. </p>  <p>  Publication of the Bill to regulate the area of AHR is a priority for the Government, and officials in the Department and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the coming weeks in order to finalise this complex legislation, which encompasses the regulation for the first time of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

The Task Force Report recommended that Personalised Budgets would be piloted and evaluated in an Irish context over a two year period. The HSE established the Personalised Budget Demonstration Projects in 2019. The Department of Health requested the National Disability Authority (NDA) to manage the evaluation of the Demonstration Project.</p><p>  Given the number of factors that the Task Force Report suggested should be tested in the Demonstration Project, the Department of Health, HSE and NDA recommended that a sample size of 180 Personalised Budget participants would be required to allow for a robust evaluation.</p><p>There are currently 92 participants in the various stages on the Pilot Personalised Budget Demonstration Project. This means that the Demonstration Projects are running behind schedule. This is due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also due to other factors such as challenges in recruiting HSE staff and the cyber-attack on the HSE.</p><p>The NDA has tendered for and selected an evaluation team to conduct the evaluation. The NDA has secured research ethics approval from some of the service providers supporting people who have engaged with the Personalised Budget Demonstration Project process and is actively engaged in seeking ethical approval from other service providers.</p><p>The evaluation is designed to capture the experiences and outcomes of all the participants (who have consented to be part of the evaluation) regardless of what their primary disability might be. However, the evaluation team have taken the needs of participants with intellectual disabilities into consideration and have developed Plain English and Easy to Read evaluation materials. Those conducting the evaluation fieldwork have extensive experience of working directly with people with disabilities, including people with intellectual disabilities.</p><p>A key output of the evaluation process will be a report capturing learning about the experiences and outcomes for persons with disabilities participating in the Demonstration Project, as well as consideration of the costs of administering the system. This will inform Department of Health considerations with regard to any future programme of Personalised Budgets</p></reply>

The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act. </p><p>The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, any inputs provided by the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p><p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>  The HSE strives to reach reimbursement decisions on all medicines, including orphan drugs, in as timely a manner as possible. However, it must ensure that the best possible price is achieved, as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments on an ongoing basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>  The 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need.</p><p>In fact, fifteen of the forty-three new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 (up to 12 November) were orphan medicines. That represents over one third of approvals this year.</p><p>The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan new medicines.</p><p>I am prepared to consider any ideas or proposals that might improve on our existing pricing and reimbursement assessment processes, including those with the aim of providing access for Irish patients to orphan medicines.</p></reply>

The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements varies between disciplines. Students are not employees and in many cases the nature of the placement can, in the main, be limited to participation in an observing and a learning capacity. This is a key part of the learning in all undergraduate programs. </p>  <p>  There are only a small number of healthcare courses where the students receive allowances to support clinical placements during training. These allowances have been in place for a number of years and based on specific requirements of the individual training program. Occupational Therapy, Speech and Language Therapy and Radiography students similar to many other healthcare students do not receive an allowance to support time spent on clinical placements as part of their training.</p>  <p>  Student Nurses and Midwives are an example of undergraduate students that do get support in the form of allowances associated with some clinical placements. The clinical hours component of undergraduate training for nurses and midwives is almost 50% of the course. Student nurses and midwives must undertake placements across a wide variety of care areas to fulfil course requirements and often these placements are away from their normal place of residence. In these instances, travel to, and alternative and additional accommodation to normal place of residence is required for a number of weeks. This is supported by an allowance towards the cost of additional accommodation. Additional support is being provided to student nurses and midwives needing overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements. This is a vouched system of support in place since 2004 and only applicable for some clinical placements.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-16a.1592.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021121600077#WRDD03500"><p>The Programme for Government commits to providing free contraception for women, starting with the 17-25 age cohort.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, funding for free contraception, starting with women aged 17-25, has been allocated in 2022. The initiative is gradually being introduced by age cohort, starting with younger women who are least likely to be financially independent and where cost has been shown to be a greater barrier to access contraception.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide for:</p>  <p>  - The cost of prescription contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception and administration of contraceptive injections plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove long-acting reversible contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of a maximum of two consultations per annum with GPs and other doctors to discuss forms of contraception suitable for individual patients and to enable prescription of same.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that a wide range of contraceptive options, currently available to medical card holders, will be made available through this scheme. This includes contraceptive injections, implants, various types of intrauterine system (IUS) or device (IUD; commonly known as the coil), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p>  <p>  Funding for free contraception in Budget 2022 also includes an allocation for training of additional GPs in fitting and removal of various forms of long-acting reversible contraception (e.g. various forms of the coil and contraceptive implant). It is envisaged that this will commence in 2022.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it should be noted that those with a medical card already have access to most forms of contraception at minimal cost (subject only to the prescription charge), while those with a GP visit card are also supported to some extent as the clinical cost element of contraception is reduced. Furthermore, the Drugs Payment Scheme, for which anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland is eligible, covers the cost of prescription items, if these exceed the monthly limit, which will be reduced from &euro;114 to &euro;100 through measures included in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  Some access to free contraception is already enabled in some contexts. the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015, functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes. The NCDS currently distributes free condoms through 25 HSE locations, 27 higher education institutions and 44 non-government agencies. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while oral contraception and various forms of long-acting reversible contraception can be more effective at preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs that is not provided by non-barrier forms of contraception.</p>  <p>  In order to give time to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals and ensure the implementation of service delivery arrangements through the appropriate areas of the healthcare system, it is envisaged that the scheme will commence in August 2022, but this is dependent on legislative timelines. Work on the legislative process is commencing and engagement with relevant stakeholders in the healthcare sector will commence in Q1 2022.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. </p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached documents. This information shows the number of patients on the Inpatient &amp;amp; Daycase (IPDC) waiting list at Mayo University Hospital. In regard to average wait times for inpatient and outpatients at Mayo University Hospital, the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p><p><b>Mayo University Hospital IPDC Waiting List</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>0-6 Mths</th>       <th>6-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-18 Mths</th>       <th>18+ Mths</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>589</td>       <td>198</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>442</td>       <td>1365</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) techniques have been applied to the data to preserve confidentiality and mitigate against identification or self-identification of individuals. In cases where there are less than 5 people in any particular cell, we have replaced that value with the average (mean) of all values that are less than 5 across that category. Any decimal values which arise have then been rounded. This may cause some rounding to occur when calculating sub-totals.</p><p>Where there are &amp;lt;20 patients waiting in a particular specialty/hospital, we have aggregated the numbers under a &lsquo;Small Volume&rsquo; heading.</p><p><b>Mayo University Hospital Mean &amp;amp; Median Wait Times as of 25/11/2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>IP</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mean</td>       <td>396</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Median</td>       <td>278</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OP</td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mean</td>       <td>469</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Median</td>       <td>320</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This increase is resulting in a higher number of admissions to the hospitals. The care needs of many of these patients require a greater length of stay in hospital. Covid-19 is also continuing to have a significant impact on bed capacity, either in caring for patients with the virus, or as a result of bed closures caused by Covid restrictions.</p><p>Bed capacity has also been impacted by staffing resources. A significant overseas nursing recruitment campaign is being progressed by the Saolta Group, with the intention of having additional resources coming into the service in the next 3 months.  Interviews are currently in progress.</p><p>Plans for additional capacity across Saolta sites are outlined below:</p><p>University Hospital Galway:</p><p>Ahead of the proposed new Emergency Department development at University Hospital Galway, Saolta Hospital Group advises that the handover of the Temporary Emergency Department (Phase 1) in UHG is scheduled for end of April 2022, with the handover of the internal replanned area (Phase 2) scheduled for end of July 2022.  The temporary ED facility, and in particular, the subsequent development of a new Emergency Department and Women &amp;amp; Children&rsquo;s Block at the hospital, are key to addressing accommodation issues and meeting service demands.</p><p>Construction of a replacement cardiothoracic ward commenced in Q2 2021. This will provide 12 additional beds. The works are expected to be completed in Q2 2022.</p><p>Mayo University Hospital:</p><p>Funding is being  provided for 40 beds off-site.  At this point 18 are operational and a further 12 will be available early in 2022.</p><p>Portiuncula University Hospital:</p><p>A new ward block development will provide a 50-bed replacement ward. It is hoped to award a contract for this work early next year.</p><p>Also, the design of a 12 bedded isolation ward in a vacated area of the hospital is progressing. </p><p>Sligo University Hospital:</p><p>It is intended that enabling works for a medical block, consisting of 42 bedded single room accommodation with ancillary space, will begin in early 2022. </p><p>Letterkenny University Hospital:</p><p>An additional 39 beds have been approved for LUH.  Of these, 16 are operational. The remaining 23 beds will become operational in Q1 2022.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practicing GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted on-going funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.</p></reply>

The total value of dairy exports exhibited more variation but has, nevertheless, averaged &euro;3.8 billion during the same timeframe.</p><p>Irish sheep meat, which is traditionally less reliant than other meat species on the UK market, is having another consecutive year of significant growth. According to the CSO, the value of Irish sheep meat exports for the first three quarters of 2021 were up almost &euro;15 million, or 6%, on the same period in 2020 and nearly &euro;50 million, or 20%, on 2019.</p><p>Focusing on specific product category developments in the UK market, the overall trend over the last three years is a gradual shift away from reliance on that market for the four main meat species and dairy produce.</p><p>Nevertheless, overall exports of Irish agri-food products to the UK have recovered compared to earlier in the year and are up for the first three quarters of the year by &euro;421m, or 11.3%, compared to 2020.

Exports to the UK are also up for the first eight months of 2021 - &euro;306m/9.5% compared to 2020 and up &euro;16m/0.4% compared to 2019. When we examine Great Britain and Northern Ireland individually, we can note that exports to GB are to the end of August up &euro;34m/1.3% compared to down 20% at end of Q1 2021. Exports to NI continue to be strong, up 39%/&euro;272m compared to 2020. This compares even more favorably than Q1 2021 where exports to Northern Ireland were up 19%.</p>  <p>  These figures demonstrate no loss of market share and display the remarkable resilience of the Irish food and drink sectors particularly in the face of market disruptions such as Brexit and Covid. My Department and its agencies will continue to remain focused on maximising the value of Irish agri-food exports globally in particular supporting continued diversification into EU and third country markets. A key component of this strategy has been our Trade Mission agenda and key customer engagements. In 2021, these engagements were held virtually and focused on Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, China, Singapore, and West Africa, as well as on our traditional markets in the EU, UK, and US. For 2022, a schedule of extensive in-person Trade Missions to several key priority markets is planned. </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to work on the opportunities provided by recent EU Free Trade Agreements with third countries, and to press at Government-to-Government level for the removal of technical market access barriers across a range of third country markets. </p></reply>

The breakdown between national and the co-funded element will depend on the residual spending profiles as there are different EU funding rates including the European Recovery Instrument Funding which is set at 100% and will only become clearer as the programme progresses.</p></reply>

The availability of credit and high costs mean that fertiliser is being imported in smaller quantities. While stocks of fertiliser are lower, it is expected that overall usage and demand will also be lower.  </p>  <p>  I raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs at recent EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council meetings. I called on the EU Commission to consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including monitoring the evolution of markets linked to agricultural inputs, particularly in relation to fertilisers; and the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined as a priority.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Climate Action Plan commits to more targeted and reduced use of chemical nitrogen fertiliser while maintaining the same level of grass production through a number of measures including improved soil fertility and greater use of clover and multi-species swards.</p>  <p>  I have introduced a number of initiatives to support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser including a new initiative to support the planting of multi-species swards and a pilot Soil Sampling Programme.  Additionally, I have asked Teagasc to develop a roadmap for farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers on farms.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser and my officials will closely monitor the fertiliser market and how it develops in the weeks and months ahead.</p></reply>

In 2021 it was 60,847 tonnes.  The decline of 2.86% between those years is attributable to a number of factors including share adjustments arising from the 2014 Mackerel agreement between the EU, Norway and the Faroes; the TCA Agreement with the UK and the state of the stock and the scientific advice for the relevant years. It is not possible to say what the quota for Ireland or any other country will be in the future as that will also depend on such factors as the future scientific advice and any new sharing agreement at Coastal States level.  The quotas within the EU Member States for the relevant years are set down in Council Regulation (EU) No 23/2010 of 14 January 2010 for 2010 and  COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) 2021/1239 of 29 July 2021 for 2021.</p>  <p>  For all countries referenced by the deputy, the official ICES  (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) mackerel catch and landings data are listed in Table 11 on page 215 of the Marine Institute Stock Book which is available at The Stock Book 2021: Annual Review of Fish Stocks in 2021 with Management Advice for 2022 (marine.ie).

At various times of the year, they can be found from the Iberian peninsula in the south to the Barents Sea in the far north, in the North sea and as far west as the mid-Atlantic ridge. During the summer months, the bulk of the stock is found feeding in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters. Later in the year, they migrate south to spawn during the first half of the year in warmer waters, typically to the west of Britain and Ireland for Blue Whiting while Mackerel also spawn in the Bay of Biscay. Detailed information on the spawning behaviour of mackerel is available from the mackerel egg survey which takes place every three years. Over the most recent decade, this survey indicates that, while Irish waters have remained very important, the distribution of spawning activity has expanded both north and west and has become more variable in terms of the timing and location of the peak of spawning. In the case of Blue Whiting, an annual survey is carried out. As with mackerel, while Irish waters are an important spawning location, the overall extent of spawning is very dependent on stock size and prevailing oceanographic conditions.</p>  <p>  During the 2021 annual NEAFC negotiations on mackerel and blue whiting, working groups were established to investigate the utility of available data in determining the location of the stock during each phase of its life cycle. When complete, this work may provide a methodology to quantify proportions in individual zones. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the Irish quota for Blue Whiting was 35,373t and Mackerel was 60,847t.  </p></reply>

It is open to individual farmers to decide what enterprise they undertake and to what scale it should be undertaken, according to their  land type and with due consideration to the market terms for their products.  </p>  <p>  As only basic malt is produced in Ireland, drinks requiring specialised malts are often either reliant on imported malt or the export of Irish grain for processing and the re-importation for use in the drinks industry.   </p>  <p>  Independent reports estimate that 93% of all barley used in brewing and distilling is native barley, and that the balance is sourced mainly from the UK, with some imports also from the EU. </p>  <p>  The technical files for the Geographical Indication (GI) for Irish Spirit Drink Irish Whiskey/Uisce Beatha Eireannach/Irish Whisky was confirmed by the European Commission in March 2019 as meeting the required conditions laid down in relevant EU Regulation. </p>  <p>  Whilst the Irish Whiskey Technical file contains specifics relating to the types and combinations of grains to be used for the creation of mashes for the production of each of the varieties of Irish Whiskey, it does not specify any requirements regarding the sourcing of the raw materials including grains utilised in the production of Irish Whiskey.</p>  <p>  Restricting the sourcing of inputs such as cereals/grains in the production of Spirit Drinks cannot conflict with the EU Treaty rules on the freedom of movement of goods. However, notwithstanding the absence of such a requirement in the specification, the malting sector has undoubtedly delivered an added value outlet for Irish barley growers in recent years with the brewing and distilling sectors utilising approximately 250,000 tonnes of Irish barley annually of which 90,000 tonnes were purchased for the Irish whiskey industry.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that requests have been submitted to my Department seeking various amendments to the Irish Whiskey technical file. Any amendments to the technical file must undergo detailed scrutiny to assess compliance with the EU rules for Geographical Indications and spirit drinks and will also require consultation with stakeholders. </p></reply>

Following engagement with all those involved, I have decided to defer the implementation of the element requiring anti-parasitic medicines to be supplied on foot of a veterinary prescription until 1st June 2022. This will enable all stakeholders make the necessary business and/or infrastructural adjustments to ensure compliance with the Regulations across all current supply routes and ensure farmers are not disadvantaged. </p><p>I have set out a clear roadmap for implementing key elements within the new Regulations including: </p> <blockquote> 	1.  The new requirements regarding the prescribing of antimicrobials, including antibiotics and medicated feed, will come into effect on January 28th 2022.<br /><br />2.  Veterinary prescriptions will be required for anti-parasitic medicines from 1st June 2022.<br /><br />3.  The mandatory requirement to use the new National Veterinary Prescription System (NVPS) is deferred until 1st June 2022. Veterinary practitioners can continue to issue paper-based prescriptions in the current format until then.<br /><br />4.  The NVPS will be available for voluntary use by vets from the end of January onwards, helping ensure that prescribers and dispensers are familiar with the system when its use becomes compulsory.<br /><br />5.  Prescriptions for anti-parasitic medicines issued by vets after 1st June will be valid for a maximum period of 12-months. Anti-parasitic medicines can then be purchased by the farmer via the NVPS from his preferred supplier at any time throughout the period that the prescription is valid. </blockquote>  <p>I am also in the process of finalising a proposal to introduce a large-scale Targeted Advisory Service on Animal Health (TASAH) programme specifically focused on parasite control on farms in 2022.  This measure will allow farmers engage a specifically trained vet to provide advice on parasite control measures in their herd, at no cost to the farmer.</p><p>I recognise that the new Veterinary Medicines Regulation means significant change for farmers, vets, pharmacists and licensed merchants &ndash; all of whom have, and will, play key roles in maintaining the health of our livestock. In this context, it is important to recall that the  overarching objective of the Regulations is to address the issue of development of resistance to anti-microbial medicines and also anti-parasitic medicines for the long term benefit of farmers and society.  </p><p>I have consulted widely and listened to a range of voices on this topic, and I believe the steps I have outlined will ensure that we address the challenge of anti-microbial and anti-parasitic resistance and support the health and welfare of our livestock, thus improving productivity. Farmers will continue to have access to a range of sales points thus helping competition, and licensed merchants will continue to be a trusted source of animal health products.</p></reply>

A further one-off allocation of &euro;10m was provided to the Stability Fund for 2021.</p><p>The COVID-19 Stability Fund 2021 was launched on Thursday 6th May, and was targeted at organisations, that met the published criteria, and which deliver critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which faced closure or a loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. 244 organisations were supported under the Stability Fund in 2021.  All applicants have now received an outcome and the fund is closed. There are no plans to reopen the Stability Fund at this time. </p><p>In November, I was pleased to launch the new Community Activities Fund. This &euro;9m fund is being provided to support community and voluntary groups impacted by COVID-19.  This once-off funding, allocated under the Department&rsquo;s Community Enhancement Programme and administered locally by the Local Community Development Committees will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities. Groups will also be able to use the funding to carry out necessary repairs and to purchase equipment such as tables and chairs, tools and signage, laptops and printers, lawnmowers, canopies and training equipment. Applications for funding can be made to the relevant LCDC. Contact details for LCDCs are available here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/38066e-local-community-development-committees-list/</i>.</p><p>My Department also developed a Support Fund to provide additional funding to organisations supported under the Community Services Programme (CSP) and recently announced a further extension of &euro;1m to the CSP Support Fund to cover the period up to December 2021, bringing the total funding allocated to the CSP Support Fund to &euro;8.95m for 2020-2021.  This funding was provided to CSP supported organisations who required additional assistance to continue to retain the CSP supported employees on their payroll, provided assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution and supported organisations considered by my Department to be most in need, to cover overhead costs such as insurance, light, heat and Audit fees.</p><p>In general, I would encourage all organisations to continue to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company, and to check on the Gov.ie website in order to be aware of funding opportunities as they become available.</p></reply>
