Each of the five levels contains a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of measures which are intended, collectively, to contribute to lowering risk of transmission in alignment with the risk level at that time. The Framework is informed by public health advice, but also recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible.</p>  <p>  The plan sets out the decision-making framework and the respective roles of the National Public Health Emergency Team, the COVID-19 Oversight Group, the Cabinet Committee which I chair and the Senior Officials Group.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the measures and restrictions in place at any given time are taken collectively by Government, and reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p></reply>

In the absence of a license from IMRO/PPI, the playing of copyright-protected music is not permitted. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I do not have any function in the setting of tariffs charged by organisations representing the rights of copyright holders.  However, it is open to a person affected by such charges to refer a dispute, under Section 152 of CRRA, to the Controller of Intellectual Property. </p>  <p>  Further information on the role of the Controller of Intellectual Property and the options for referring disputes are available at www.ipoi.gov.ie.</p></reply>

Most recently, at the meeting of the LEEF Sub-Group on Employment Legislation/Regulation which I chaired on 30th   September, I sought the views of LEEF members.  Submissions from ICTU, IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) were received. </p>  <p>  The matter of a further extension is currently under consideration.   In its deliberations, the Government will have regard to the social partners&rsquo; views, the criteria and principles underpinning the emergency provision and the public health and labour market situations.  </p>  <p>  All other redundancy provisions remain unchanged and in force.  If an employer is going to make an employee redundant, protections such as notice periods for redundancy and the payment of a redundancy lump-sum to the affected employee still apply.</p></reply>

However, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.</p><p>COVID-19 has presented undeniable challenges to our ongoing efforts to sustain and grow foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world is already disrupting the typical way in which the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p><p>As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.</p><p>The following table details the number of IDA site visits per county in each of the years 2016 to 2019, and to date in 2020. The 2020 figures capture the total visits per County taking place with potential new investors.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-18a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020111800068#WRB02200"><p>Since the outcome of the UK referendum in 2016 confirming the UK&rsquo;s intention to leave the European Union, the Government has, while fully respecting that decision, acknowledged that it is regrettable.  </p>  <p>  Whatever the outcome of the ongoing future partnership negotiations between the EU and the UK, we are preparing for the fact that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union at the end of this year. This will have significant and lasting implications particularly for Irish businesses trading with the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Of particular interest to the Deputy is a 2018 study entitled "Strategic Implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK trading relations" a comprehensive and independent expert study that my Department commissioned from Copenhagen Economics. The study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. The rise of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence is the main factor driving the results as opposed to the imposition of the tariff regimes of the EU and the UK on their respective imports/goods.</p>  <p>  This analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy action being taken although this of course is not the case given the extensive Brexit mitigation actions put in place across Government and across all sectors of the economy in the past few years. </p>  <p>  All of the scenarios examined in the 2018 study produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario. The scenarios considered reflected four of the possible outcomes from the future relationship between the EU and the UK &ndash; an EEA scenario, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a Customs Union, or a worst-case, no trade deal, WTO scenario. </p>  <p>  The WTO scenario was found to have the most negative impact on the Irish economy gradually reducing GDP growth by 7% by 2030; an EEA scenario would be least damaging gradually reducing GDP growth by 2.8% by 2030. The study found that regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy was still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit would have a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p>  <p>  Following the adoption of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) on the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK last year, my Department undertook further Brexit analysis with Copenhagen Economics. Under this latest study, two additional scenarios for a Free Trade Agreement were examined to take account of the provisions of the RPD published in January 2020. This latest study is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the findings from this study suggest that a Brexit outcome based on the RPD is likely to reduce Irish GDP by between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030 compared with a baseline where the UK remains a member of the EU. This compares to a negative impact of 7% in the no deal (WTO basis) modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics study.</p>  <p>  In response to the various Brexit analysis and studies undertaken across Government I have, over the course of the last three budgets put in place through the enterprise agencies, an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist businesses to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity support through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies.   </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures. Government has also provided for a recovery fund to assist businesses in the aftermath of COVID-19 and Brexit. A full list is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dbei.gov.ie and on www.Gov.ie/Brexit. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the overall negative impact on the economy, IDA Ireland has been working hard to capture any possible increase in investment in Ireland as a result of Brexit. This work has resulted in 93 Brexit-related investments to date with an associated employment potential of 5,900. Two-thirds of these investments are in the International Financial Services sector with the remaining third spread out over the Life Sciences, Technology, Business Services, and Engineering sectors. While this is good news, it by no means makes up for the negatives and the expected difficulties that businesses, particularly those that trade with Britain, will face as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>The Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK trading relationship following Brexit and it is the case that the UK has always, and will continue, to be an important market for Ireland.</p></reply>

It is clear that renewable hydrogen could play a key role in Ireland's future energy system as we move towards our target of net zero emissions by 2050. Ireland has considerable potential to produce renewable hydrogen from excess renewable electricity, particularly from offshore wind. This would provide a zero emission energy source  for use in sectors that are difficult to decarbonise such as heavy goods vehicles and industry.    My Department will continue to work with other departments, agencies and stakeholders to inform Ireland's input into the hydrogen strategy. This will include consideration of whether Ireland should seek to develop a stand-alone national hydrogen strategy or whether it would be more appropriate to integrate the actions needed to develop hydrogen into the next iterations of the Climate Action Plan and the National Energy and Climate Plan.</p></reply>

From 1 January 2021, many aspects of our relationship with our nearest neighbour will change fundamentally as we will no longer share EU membership. While the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period, I can advise the Deputy that the net impact of Brexit on the policy areas within my remit is anticipated to be strongly negative. </p><p>Regarding the economic impact, joint Department of Finance and ESRI analysis of the macroeconomic implications of Brexit, published in March 2019, broadly captures the range of possible future relationships between the EU and the UK.<b></b>The analysis finds that in the long-run (i.e. 10 years), compared to a no Brexit baseline, the level of GDP in Ireland would be around 2.6 per cent lower in a deal scenario and 5.0 per cent lower in a no-deal scenario. The principal negative impact arises from the trade shock, mitigated somewhat by a positive FDI shock resulting from a redirection to Ireland of investment from firms looking to relocate within the single market. While there is uncertainty around the ultimate trade and FDI impacts, the analysis suggests that in each scenario, any positive impact on FDI would be far outweighed by the negative impact on trade.</p><p>Regarding Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector, the nature, scale and complexity of the sector will change in a number of ways as a result of firms relocating from the UK as a result of Brexit and those looking to set up operations in the EU for the first time. The industry in Ireland has become broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time. The Government and the state agencies, such as the IDA, continue to work to fully capture any opportunities for inward investment that emerge. </p><p>However, it should be noted that the Central Bank of Ireland has had to work closely with financial services firms and market participants to ensure that they have contingency plans in place for the end of the transition period on 31 December in order to mitigate a range of risks that would otherwise arise. My Department has also included measures in the 2020 Brexit Omnibus Bill in order to minimise disruption to financial services.</p><p>Finally, there is also a firmly negative impact on customs procedures and the impact of these requirements on business processes and costs due to the UK leaving the Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January. Any business, regardless of size, that moves goods from, to or through the UK will need to complete a range of customs formalities, as well as Sanitary and Phytosanitary and other regulatory requirements. This will result in additional costs and administrative procedures associated with customs formalities for all businesses that trade with the UK. It is expected that the majority of businesses will engage a customs clearance agent to act on their behalf. This will increase pressure on this sector in terms of increased client numbers and increased customs declarations as each consignment will require an individual customs declaration.</p><p>The Government has been planning for Brexit since before the UK referendum to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all possible scenarios.  On 9 September, the Government published its Brexit Readiness Action Plan, which details the actions Government will take and the actions that citizens and businesses should take to prepare for the end of the transition period. Citizens and businesses should now finalise their readiness work for the end of the transition period. This work will continue in the weeks ahead.</p></reply>

The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I am bringing forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified. </p>  <p>  I consider this to be an interim solution only. While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  While it was regrettable that it was necessary to temporarily close the scheme to new applicants, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating for existing Primary Medical Cert holders. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner. </p></reply>

The Central Bank has taken a number of actions in these areas since 2016 in furtherance of its consumer protection mandate. Regarding case selection, the Central Bank carefully considers which cases will best achieve the Central Bank&rsquo;s strategic objectives, and through strong enforcement outcomes motivate compliant behaviour and promote a culture of fairness and high standards within the financial services industry. To this end, the Central Bank maintains effective processes for the selection of referrals to enforcement. As well as evidential matters, factors such as the seriousness or significance of the suspected contraventions and the harm or risk of harm to consumers are among the considerations relevant to the appropriateness of the use of enforcement tools. </p>  <p>  The objective is to ensure that the Central Bank is strategically deploying its enforcement tools and efficiently using its resources to achieve effective and strong enforcement outcomes. The two largest monetary sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank &ndash; Permanent TSB plc sanctioned &euro;21million in 2019 and KBC Bank Ireland plc sanctioned &euro;18.3million in 2020 - evidence the Central Bank&rsquo;s commitment to taking strong enforcement action with real deterrence value where serious and significant breaches of consumer protection requirements are committed. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank, as a systemic regulator, holds regulated firms and the people who run them accountable where there are serious or significant breaches of regulatory requirements and standards.</p>  <p>  Since 2006 the Central Bank has concluded 139 cases under the Administrative Sanctions Procedure  (ASP) framework with fines imposed of &euro;123.98m. Of the 139 outcomes, 22 were imposed against individuals. The Central Bank has also taken action to revoke 28 firms&rsquo; authorisations on an involuntary basis. A further 13 firms were refused authorisation to undertake regulated activities.</p>  <p>  While the Central Banks enforcement work spans the entirety of its mandate and is wider than the Consumer Protection Code alone, since 1 July 2016 it has delivered a number of significant outcomes which were integral to the Consumer Protection Code, including:</p>  <p>  - against Axa Insurance Limited, which related to the operation of the Minimum Competency Code and Consumer Protection Code;</p>  <p>  - against the New Ireland Assurance Company plc which related to the provision of incomplete information to consumers under the Consumer Protection Code;</p>  <p>  - against Springboard Mortgages Limited in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes;</p>  <p>  - against Permanent TSB plc in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes; and</p>  <p>  - against KBC Bank Ireland plc in respect of tracker mortgage failings under the Consumer Protection Codes.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Central Bank uses a wide range of other tools to support its consumer protection work. It has settled 36 cases under the ASP framework, prohibited/suspended or refused 12 individuals under the Fitness and Probity regime and revoked 12 firm authorisations. It has also issued 168 Warning Notices against unauthorised providers.  </p>  <p>  Ultimately for all cases, whether they are specifically based on a breach of the Consumer Protection Code, or another sector of legislation, it is important to note that while a case may not have been settled under the Consumer Protection Codes, protecting consumers is at the centre of all of these enforcement outcomes. For example, since July 2016 the Central Bank has:</p>  <p>  - delivered outcomes concerning (4 by ASP,  7 by revocation) retail intermediaries for failing to have adequate professional indemnity insurance (PII) in place. The Central Bank views PII as a key prudential and consumer protection safeguard and compliance with PII obligations is therefore fundamental to the Central Bank&rsquo;s mandate of protecting consumers.</p>  <p>  - delivered an outcome against an individual in the insurance sector who under-reserved loss claim reserve estimates which resulted in the firm&rsquo;s financial position being artificially enhanced. This led to a significant risk to policy holders and consumers in the event the insurance firm did not hold sufficient assets to meets its liabilities. It is imperative that individuals working in regulated financial services and particularly those in senior roles, fully understand the risks and consequences that their decisions, actions and behaviours may have for an organisation, its employees, its customers and the wider market.</p>  <p>  - issued 7 prohibition notices against individuals whose actions may have or had the potential to result in consumer harm. The Central Bank may issue a Prohibition Notice prohibiting an individual from performing a controlled function for a specified period or indefinitely, if we form the opinion that an individual is not of appropriate fitness and probity.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank intervenes, within the scope of its regulatory mandate (which extends beyond the Consumer Protection Code), to ensure the interests of consumers are protected by focusing on the issues, which pose the greatest potential or actual risk of consumer harm. Its targeted interventions are aimed at addressing widespread issues that affect many customers.</p>  <p>  A credible threat of enforcement underscores its powers to protect. It takes robust enforcement action aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour by and within regulated entities. Transparent and strong action where entities or individuals fall short of required standards helps to deter poor practices, achieve compliance and encourage the behaviour it expects.</p></reply>

This includes, for example, self-employment income from a trade or profession and employment income earned by a proprietary director and his/her spouse or civil partner. The Earned Income Tax Credit is being increased from &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,650 in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill and this increase will take effect for the 2020 tax year and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  An individual may be eligible for both the Employee Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, if they have qualifying sources of income, but the maximum combined credit available for the year cannot exceed &euro;1,650.  This is the position for all taxpayers in receipt of self-employment and employment income.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that social welfare pensions are taxable under Schedule E but are not subject to deductions under the PAYE system.  Pensioners usually have their tax liability on social welfare pensions collected by a reduction in their tax credits. This is sometimes called &ldquo;coding&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Pensioners aged 65 years or over are also entitled to the Age Tax Credit, which is &euro;245 for single persons and &euro;490 for married couples and civil partners.</p>  <p>  I trust this explains the issue and clarifies for the Deputy that there is no discrimination arising in the manner suggested.</p></reply>

I made a statement on 1 July to express Ireland's concern in relation to the adoption of this law, and the situation has been raised directly with the Chinese Ambassador to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The EU has made a number of statements in relation to this situation, most recently on 12 November following the disqualification of members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. This statement reiterated our concern regarding Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy under the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Council of the EU adopted Conclusions on Hong Kong on 28 July 2020 in response to the adoption of the National Security Law. These set out a coordinated package of response measures in various fields, including the operation of Member States' extradition agreements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong. In line with these Conclusions, the Government agreed on 13 October to suspend Ireland's Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  This decision, which was taken in concert with a number of other EU Member States, clearly signals Ireland's concerns in relation to the rule of law in Hong Kong and the erosion of judicial independence promised under the One Country, Two Systems principle.</p>  <p>  My Department, through our Consulate General in Hong Kong and our Embassy in Beijing, will remain alert to the situation in Hong Kong and, along with our EU partners, will continue to raise our concerns with Chinese authorities.</p></reply>

The European Union delivered a statement and separately raised specific concerns in relation to the draft text on behalf of Ireland and other Member States. </p>  <p>  The EU statement welcomed some of the changes in the latest draft of the Legally Binding Instrument; highlighted further necessary changes; and outlined the many measures underway within the EU and across Member States to give greater protection to human rights in the context of business activities.  France was the only EU Member State to intervene and all statements are publicly available on the website of the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  As stated previously, Ireland remains open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty. With regard to scope, we believe that all economic operators, whether transnational or purely domestic, should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. We would also wish to see essential human rights principles, including gender equality and protection of human rights defenders, reflected in any possible instrument which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, any new initiative should build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to which Ireland is firmly committed. We have provided input on all of these issues during deliberations at EU level to develop the EU position in advance of the latest meeting of the OEWG. I will consider whether making an intervention at national level at the next meeting in 2021, in addition to contributing to the EU position and statement, could be useful in further highlighting these priorities. </p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of a small number of UN Member States which have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights.  I am also pleased to note that the forthcoming EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy will contain strong commitments in the area of Business and Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Let me therefore assure the Deputy that we will continue to play a constructive role to advance the business and human rights agenda both within the EU and the UN.   My officials in Dublin and Geneva have also met with the Irish Coalition on Business and Human Rights and this engagement will continue.</p>  <p>  In respect of the potential for domestic legislation, I am aware that the European Union Commissioner for Justice is preparing a legislative initiative for 2021, which may introduce mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence across value chains.  While these policy matters fall outside of the remit of my own Department, my officials are following these important developments closely.</p></reply>

However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p><p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies to be published on the school&rsquo;s website. </p><p>The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria for application in the event of oversubscription, in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p><p>Further information on the new admission process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment</i>.</p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p><p>The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p><p>1. Enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p><p>2. Additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements, Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.  </p><p>3. Utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process.</p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>-  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>-  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>-  Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 45 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022. This included a new primary school, Greystones Community National School, which was established in 2015.  A new post-primary school, Greystones Community College opened in Greystones for the 2020/21 school year as a regional solution for the Kilcoole and Greystones area.  </p><p>The following post-primary schools serve the Greystones School Planning Area:</p><p>-  Temple Carrig Secondary School, Greystones &ndash; this is a co-educational school with capacity for 750 pupils and was established in 2014.</p><p>-  St. David&rsquo;s Secondary School Greystones is a co-educational school and a major building project to expand the school to cater for 750 pupils commenced on site in October 2020. This project is expected to be completed in 22 months i.e. by July 2023.</p><p>-  Greystones Community College &ndash; this new school was established in September 2020. The proposal is to provide permanent accommodation for 1,000 pupils when the school is fully developed. Discussions are ongoing with the landowner of a designated site at Charlesland, Greystones with a view to acquiring the site to construct the new school. </p><p>Greystones Community College opened its doors to 64 first year pupils in September 2020 in interim accommodation in Greystones Lawn Tennis Club. My Department is looking at all potential options in the area in the short and medium term ahead of the school&rsquo;s move to its designated permanent site in Charlesland, Greystones. This will include the provision of appropriate temporary accommodation, including specialist rooms, as quickly as possible as the current school year progresses. My officials will continue to work closely with Kildare Wicklow ETB and the school to ensure that the needs of the school community are met. </p><p>In addition, there is the existing school in the adjacent Kilcoole School Planning Area, Col&aacute;iste Craobh Abhann, which currently has accommodation for 750 pupils and for which there is a major project approved to expand the school to 1,000 pupils. This project is in early architectural planning and is being delivered by the National Development Finance Agency. Additional temporary accommodation was approved in 2019 to cater for expanding enrolments pending completion of this extension. It is open to the school's patron to submit an application for additional interim accommodation to my Department should this be required.</p><p>Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.  </p><p>In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable &ndash; generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation. </p><p>My Department is concerned to ensure that all pupils in the Greystones school planning area have access to a primary or post-primary school school place in September 2021.</p></reply>

The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.  </p>  <p>  Where an employee considers the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, a review can be requested by the employee where Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided.

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to this.  </p><p>The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  </p><p>The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded.  This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  </p><p>The Government was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female membership in its membership, and five of the nine members of the Commission appointed directly by the Government are women.  It will be chaired by Ms. Josephine Feehily.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, will be keenly aware of the gender dimension of pensions policy and delivery and will bring this perspective to bear in its work.  </p><p>The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but also the associated social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms.  The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.</p><p>It should be noted that while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by 30 June of next year and the Government will take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months.</p><p>Further details of the Commission's membership and terms of reference are available on the Departmental website at: <i> </i></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This is because of a long-standing arrangement known as the Common Travel Area (CTA).  The CTA pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it.  Both the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom are committed to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances and a Memorandum of Understanding to that effect was signed on the 8 May 2019.</p>  <p>As part of that commitment to the CTA, the Government also entered into a Convention on Social Security with the Government of the United Kingdom, signed on the 1st   February 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Irish and British citizens living in either country will maintain the right to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in either country and to access social insurance payments, such as state pension (contributory), in either country just as before.   The agreement passed through the Parliamentary ratification procedures in both jurisdictions during March 2019, and now stands ready to be given legal effect on the 31 December 2020. </p>  <p>  From January 2021, many aspects of our relationship with our nearest neighbour will change fundamentally as we will no longer share EU membership.  However, the Government remains committed to protecting and strengthening the Ireland-UK relationship following the end of the transition period.  Strong and vibrant connections are vital with our closest neighbour and trading partner.  Both Ireland and the UK remain co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and are, as outlined, committed to the ongoing maintenance of the Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges. </p>  <p>  While we will work with our UK colleagues on strengthening this relationship, it is also clear that Brexit, in any form, will have significant impacts in Ireland.  The Department of Finance has projected over the medium-term the level of GDP would be around 2% &ndash; 3.25 % lower relative to a hypothetical status quo scenario, with most of the impact in the first year or so.</p>  <p>  The Government has been planning for Brexit since before the UK referendum to ensure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for all possible scenarios.  On 9 September, the Government published its Brexit Readiness Action Plan, which details the actions Government will take and the actions citizens and businesses should take to prepare for the end of the transition period.  This work will continue in the weeks ahead.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

But level 5 restrictions may have implications for the number of referrals during this period.    Once restrictions are reduced or lifted, referrals to CE schemes should begin to get back to more normal levels, with participants being referred by the Departments case offices to CE schemes.  Therefore I can assure the  Deputy that new referrals will be made to the scheme over the coming period. I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

This could more accurately reflect their current income level. </p><p>In addition, the &lsquo;Sudden Change Assessment&rsquo; option allows for applicants to declare that they have had an ongoing change to their income.

Applications for the first round of funding closed on 20 October, but additional rounds are planned and the dates will be announced soon.</p><p>Childcare providers are responsible for their own sessions, fees and admissions policies. However, the funding package and supports outlined above were put in place to support the sustainability of childcare providers throughout the pandemic, and to provide them with the opportunity to be as flexible as possible in supporting the families using their services.</p><p>Further information and resources for parents are available by contacting The Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530 or by visiting <i>www.ncs.gov.i</i>e.

The decision was taken in line with public health guidelines, for the safety of our customers and staff. First-time registrations require the taking of fingerprints and therefore cannot be done online. The Office will reopen as soon as Level 5 restrictions are lifted and appointments will be available to people living in the Dublin area who are required to register for the first time.</p><p>Registrations outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network.

Slaughterhouses are also required to have official veterinarians present to examine the carcases of slaughtered animals post-mortem to check for evidence of disease and traces of illegal substances, to verify compliance with hygiene requirements and to stamp the carcases with a health mark to verify that they are suitable for human consumption. These checks are fundamental to maintaining the safety of the supply of meat and to protect public health.  Policy concerning animal health and welfare rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM).</p>  <p>  Meat inspection by official veterinarians has been legislated for at European level since 1964 (Directive 64/432/EEC) and in Ireland for the smaller slaughterhouses since 1988 (Abattoirs Act 1988). The current legal framework for meat inspection is Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and implementing legislation (Regulations (EU) 2019/624 and 2019/627), as given effect to by the European Union (Food and Food Hygiene) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 22 of 2020). </p>  <p>  In Ireland, large slaughterhouses are supervised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and smaller ones by the Local Authorities &ndash; in each case the official food controls take place under a service contract between the respective official agency and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Regulations governing hygiene requirements in slaughterhouses, for which DAFM has policy responsibility, apply to large and small slaughterhouses, though there is scope for some flexibility for small producers in Regulation (EU) 853/2004 on the hygiene of foods of animal origin provided that the appropriate high standards of hygiene are achieved. In line with this flexibility, the smaller local authority-supervised slaughterhouses tend not to have a permanent veterinary attendance during slaughter, whereas the larger DAFM-supervised slaughterhouses tend to have a permanent veterinary presence.</p></reply>

Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Act, and has engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission. The HSE advises that Dupilumab will be included on the agenda for the December HSE Drugs Group meeting at which the two applications and the submitted representations will be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  Dupilumab remains under consideration with the HSE and a final decision will be made in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. </p><p>On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan,  unfortunately, this means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread. At Level 5 essential retail and essential services will remain open.  Further information on essential retail and essential services at Level 5 can be found at<i>:</i></p><p>Level 5 does not restrict people from purchasing any products.  It does however, restrict people from physically going into non-essential stores.  This is to stop people travelling out of their homes unnecessarily and so to limit the spread of the virus.  </p><p>While Christmas trees cannot be purchased physically in stores, customers can continue to purchase them via online or phone ordering and collection and delivery. </p><p>Further information on all levels of Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 is available at: <i>ttps://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/resilience-recovery-2020-2021-plan-for-living-with-covid-19/</i>. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the cultivation of Christmas trees is a matter that comes under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture Food and Marine.</p></reply>

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine is being made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has also purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  Deliveries of this vaccine from the manufacturer were not as quick as we would have liked, due to the very challenging international market for flu vaccines.  It is also true that demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond, and in this context it is unlikely that additional supply will become available.  </p>  <p>  While I cannot comment on individual providers, I can confirm that 1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  Distribution of the remaining 50,000 doses will commence before the end of this month.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. </p>  <p>  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

Given the volumes required, these operate as batch tests and hence take a number of hours depending on the platform and the volume being processed.</p>  <p>  The HSE has worked intensively over the last number of months to put in place a comprehensive testing and tracing operation.

On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to hunt the virus in populations where it&rsquo;s most likely and where it will do most harm. </p>  <p>  Many of the rapid Covid tests reported in the public domain and in the media which purport to offer a test result in minutes (for example antigen tests) lack the sensitivity and specificity required for healthcare. The HSE is constantly monitoring the sensitivity of all types of tests that are available (e.g. antigen and saliva tests) to ensure that, if deployed, they would be of appropriate quality and sensitivity. This issue continues to be monitored by the WHO, ECDC, HIQA, and the HSE Laboratory taskforce. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that testing for Covid-19 only provides a point-in-time result. It confers no guarantee that an individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason, for example, that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person.</p>  <p>  The testing strategy in use in Ireland remains under consideration by NPHET on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

Supports for rural GP practices have been enhanced, while the Agreement also includes increased support for GPs working in disadvantaged urban areas.</p>  <p>  The 2019 Agreement on GP contractual reforms will see the Government increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023, providing for significant increases in capitation fees for GPs who participate in the reform programme and the introduction of new fees and subsidies for additional services such as the chronic disease programme. </p>  <p>  Improved family friendly arrangements are an important feature of the revised contractual arrangements, with an increase in the locum rate for maternity and paternity cover, and an increase in the paternity leave allowance from 3 days to 2 weeks. </p>  <p>  In addition, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over the past ten years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.</p>  <p>  I believe that these measures and supports will see a needed increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p>  <p>  GPs are private practitioners who hold contracts with the HSE to provide services under various public health schemes; there are no plans at present to directly employ general practitioners. The 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, with preparatory work for the review having begun this year.</p></reply>

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level.  The new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, recommits to this Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation, stating &ldquo;Enhanced governance and accountability in the health service is a key component of Sl&aacute;intecare reform. The HSE Board is now in place and we must now bring forward detailed proposals on the six new regional health areas to deliver services for patients locally that are safe, high quality and fairly distributed.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas was expected to be brought to Government for its approval in 2020. The intention was that this plan would set out the high-level organisational design for the health system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct. Work was underway in the Department of Health and the HSE to develop these detailed proposals, in consultation with stakeholders. Understandably, this work was paused as a result of COVID-19. This programme of work will be given further consideration to take account of the Programme for Government commitment and any new considerations relating to COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  The programme plan to support the development of the Regional Health Areas included a focus on the development of resource allocation modelling on the basis of population needs assessment. One of the goals of the regional devolvement of health services is the concept of &ldquo;one region, one budget&rdquo;.  A key factor in implementing this goal will be determining the methodology and approach to the allocation of resources, on a population basis which takes account of need.  Clearly, the way in which resources are allocated will be determined by the nature of services provided at national, regional and supraregional level, as well as the governance that determines the flow of resources.  It is critical that the approach to resource allocation is equitable, quality-driven, responsive to population health needs, outcomes focussed and sets up regions to deliver best outcomes for available resources.  This will be a significant undertaking but one that is critical to the reorganisation of the health and social care service and the operation of regional structures.  The initial focus of this work will be on conducting an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; mapping of current resource allocation, learning from international approaches, feasibility and readiness assessment and stakeholder engagement.  This will inform and enable work to then commence on specification of a geographic resource allocation formula.</p></reply>

This approach is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.</p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, which is double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for administration to all persons in an at-risk group, as well as 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) for all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.</p>  <p>  As with other persons, teachers who are in an at-risk category, are eligible for vaccination without charge under the influenza vaccination programme. Those teachers not covered by the publicly funded influenza vaccination programme avail of influenza vaccination from GPs and pharmacists on a private basis.</p>  <p>  1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have now been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites since early October.  In addition, 420,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed.  Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be distributed and administered.  Given the situation on the international market, it is not likely that additional supply will be possible.  As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice.</p>  <p>  Each year a certain amount of vaccine is &ldquo;held back&rdquo; to ensure those in at-risk groups receive vaccines. With the unprecedented demand this year it is important that the HSE manage the distribution of the remaining doses in order to target administration to the at-risk groups who need it the most. The distribution of the final 50,000 doses will commence by the end of this month.</p></reply>

A ring-fenced budgetary amount for ECO schemes of 20% of the direct payment budget has been agreed by Agriculture Ministers, with a two-year so-called 'learning' period permitted at the start of the CAP Strategic Plan, to allow Member States avoid any loss of unspent funds due to lower-than-expected take-up of ECO schemes.</p>  <p>  I welcome the proposed introduction of new ECO schemes. Farmers will access these funds by undertaking additional actions which go beyond the basic environmental  requirements.  Member States will design schemes based on their own analysis of needs.  </p>  <p>  The Council position also provides Member States with an option to cap the basic income support for sustainability at &euro;100,000.  There will also be flexibility to reduce such payments above &euro;60,000.  There is a focus on  support for young farmers and an amount equal to 2% of the Direct Payments envelope must be spent on attracting and sustaining young farmers. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Ireland's interests have been protected in the Council agreement. My officials will continue to monitor progress in the trilogue negotiations, and to progress work on the development of Ireland's CAP Strategic Plan, including through ongoing consultation with stakeholders via the CAP Consultative Committee.</p></reply>

To date, over 120,000  farmers have received almost &euro;800m in advance payments and payments have continued since they commenced on the 16th October. This represents a greater amount of money paid to more farmers than in any year of the current CAP programme. </p>  <p>  There are many issues which may delay a payment to a farmer and, unfortunately, there are always a number  of complex cases that take somewhat longer to resolve than usual. My Department is committed to continuous improvement of service and we are acutely aware that resolving such complex cases in the past has lead to such delays in issuing payments to farmers. Continuous systems development is required to improve payment delivery and customer service.  </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently working to address the issue highlighted by the Deputy and will have it resolved in the near future.

Taxation measures for young trained farmers, such as 100% Stamp Duty relief and 100% Stock Relief, require the farmer to be aged under 35 years.</p></reply>

Strong and vibrant connections are vital with our closest neighbour and trading partner.  Both Ireland and the UK remain co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and are committed to the ongoing maintenance of the Common Travel Area and its associated rights and privileges which is of particular importance to those living and working in border communities.</p>  <p>  While we will work with our UK colleagues on strengthening this relationship, it is also clear that Brexit, in any form, will have significant impacts on economic sectors and communities in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The supports and funding provided by my Department to build up resilience in communities to withstand negative Brexit impacts is more important than ever and we will continue to retain flexibility within our programmes to ensure we can respond to emerging needs in communities in all parts of the country as they arise.</p></reply>
