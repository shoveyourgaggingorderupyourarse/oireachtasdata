    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300052#WRA00600"><p>While it might be assumed that there should be strong direct linkages between leasing companies and locally located aircraft maintenance operations, the position is that Global Aircraft Leasing and domestic Irish Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul firms are not mutually interdependent. While Irish based after-market services providers undoubtedly can benefit from their proximity and relationships with the Irish based operations of International Leasing firms, the global nature of both businesses means that cost competitiveness, flexibility and capability are the key determinants in companies&rsquo; decision making processes.   </p><p>  The dynamics of the aircraft maintenance business worldwide are complex and fast changing, partly due to the mobility of the assets &ndash; the planes themselves - and, also due to the influence of both the aircraft manufacturers and the engine manufacturers.  In many cases, under complex sale contracts, these manufacturers are increasingly determining where maintenance of their equipment is carried out. </p><p>  Despite the very globalised nature of both the leasing sector, and also of the maintenance sector, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have, of course, collectively been seeking to actively encourage more collaboration between the international leasing companies and the maintenance operators who are located here in Ireland.  Such synergies are promoted by the Agencies&rsquo; direct engagement with relevant companies, in an effort to develop better linkages between these two sectors of the aerospace industry.  You will appreciate however,  that in cases where leasing companies are making decisions relating to on-going maintenance  of their fleets, such decisions are solely a matter for those leasing companies themselves and are made  on commercial, business efficiency and cost grounds.   </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s success in building up a world-class Aircraft leasing sector has brought very significant benefits to the economy.  The sector now employs over 1,000 people and controls assets of over &euro;80bn.  We have 9 of the top 10 lessors by fleet size here in Ireland.  Its development to this levels has been achieved by a favourable financial climate which has been developed and we have also specialist, multi-disciplinary, personnel available with the requisite skills. In relation to work to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for Aircraft leasing, a wide range of financial and taxation incentives have been put in place over the years. These include rules on VAT, depreciation provisions and exemptions on various measures. Also of course, in relation to Corporations Tax, the attractive 12.5% rate applies.  These incentives are kept under constant review and we are very conscious of the need to be able to offer an attractive business and financial environment to attract and retain companies in such an internationally mobile sector.  </p><p>  IDA Ireland globally has been engaged on an on-going basis to attract companies in all parts of the aviation sector into Ireland both to increase employment and improve the scale of the industry in Ireland. These efforts will continue.</p><p>  Given the circumstances I have outlined, it is not considered that the very unfortunate closure of the Lufthansa engine maintenance plant in Rathcoole will adversely impact on the position of the leasing sector here.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300052#WRA00800"><p>I am aware that a number of public statements have been made in recent weeks, accompanied by media speculation, concerning the prospect of a return to some form of national-level wage bargaining for the private sector.</p><p>  The commentary has been framed in a very constructive manner; it has been driven by concerns about the potential economic and industrial relations issues that might arise over the medium term as the economy continues to stabilise and wage bargaining perhaps returns as a noticeable feature on the Irish industrial relations landscape.</p><p>  The return to such wage bargaining is already visible and I note, in this regard, that the Irish Business and Employers&rsquo; Confederation has indicated that around half of its members expect to experience some level of pay increase over the next 18 months. This will have a positive potential impact on domestic demand.</p><p>  It is vital that any wage increases negotiated are not excessive, do not hamper the emergence of job opportunities, increase costs locally or impact on our competitiveness internationally.</p><p>  We must never forget that Ireland&rsquo;s economy had become increasingly and critically uncompetitive in the five years up to 2008. Regaining cost competitiveness, which has included wage restraint among other things, has been key in our fight to recover. We must be very careful that the gains so hard fought for over the past few years are not eroded. </p><p>  Indeed, it could be argued that we have further to travel in this regard. According to the 2013 Forf&aacute;s Report on Labour Market Competitiveness, despite some reductions, labour costs in Ireland remain above OECD averages. The Report found that Ireland has the 17th highest total labour cost level in the OECD-32 and the 11th highest net wage level in the OECD-32. </p><p>  At the moment, I believe that firms and employers are taking stock of how the next 24 months will possibly pan out. Each assessment will be different and I do not believe that there is a homogeneous model for all Irish business at the moment. Rather, I think that employers must make their own assessments based on their personal experience of how their own business and sector is performing. </p><p>  We know that some sectors are expanding at a faster pace than others while some are only beginning to stabilise and return to growth. In such a current scenario I am not convinced that a national wage agreement is feasible or desirable. Indeed, I have noted, IBEC&rsquo;s view that that local bargaining based on company-level realities is the appropriate manner in which to deal with wage pressures at this stage.</p><p>  With some exceptions, Ireland has been through a period of industrial peace. IBEC and ICTU have agreed two separate Private Sector Protocols for the Orderly Conduct of Industrial Relations and Local Bargaining. This has played a significant role and I would hope that any disagreements arising during pay negotiations where they arise at company level do not cause industrial unrest.</p><p>  However, I can assure the Deputy that it is an issue that I am monitoring closely. The next 18 months will be key in terms of getting the economy expanding again and I am determined to ensure that the gains achieved and the image of Ireland as the best small country in the world in which to do business is not damaged. </p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Competitive Start fund is aimed at accelerating the development of High Potential Start-Up companies (HPSUs) and creating a strong pipeline of HPSUs.  Enterprise Ireland piloted the Competitive Start Fund in 2011 which aims to provide early stage   companies with critical funds to test the market for their products and services and progress their business plans for the global marketplace.</p><p>  Under the terms of the Competitive Start Fund, start-ups receive an equity investment of &euro;50,000 for a 10% ordinary equity stake by Enterprise Ireland matched by &euro;5,000 of promoter&rsquo;s equity.  In addition to funding, each start-up is provided with an experienced business mentor to provide support. The application process has been designed and improved to be fast and efficient to allow the new start-ups to concentrate on validating their business concept and getting to market entry stage as quickly as possible.</p><p>  To date 204 early stage companies have been approved a total of &euro;10.2 million in equity investment under the fund.  These companies employed a total of 243 people (full-time &amp;amp; part-time) as of October 2012*.  Twenty five of these companies have progressed to being HPSUs and have raised seed funding. In 2013 Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s provisional data shows that it supported the creation of 103 HPSUs.  These companies will make a significant contribution to the Irish economy and have committed to creating a total of 2,100 new jobs and generating over &euro;300 million in annual sales by the end of 2015.</p><p>  In 2014 Enterprise Ireland will launch 7 Competitive Start Fund calls with a particular focus on encouraging female entrepreneurs, young or graduate entrepreneurs, manufacturing technologies and aviation start-ups. </p><p>  * Based on the latest available 2012 Forf&aacute;s Employment data.</p></reply>

Firstly, a new operation called AvantCard was established following the purchase of part of Bank of America&rsquo;s Credit Card portfolio by Apollo. This operation employs approximately 250 staff, who manage the Irish card customers. These staff transferred from Bank of America to AvantCard (Apollo) under the EU Transfer of Undertakings Regulations on March 13th   2013.  This was a very positive development and provided more certainty regarding this part of the operation. </p><p>  The second operation remains in the ownership of Bank of America and employs approximately 200 people who manage the UK credit card customer business. The process regarding the possible sale of this UK credit card business remains on-going. Bank of America continues to look for a buyer for this business. </p><p>  On another positive note, Apollo has acquired the entire building in Carrick and has leased office space back to Bank of America. We welcome this investment in Carrick-on-Shannon by Apollo.</p><p>  Government&rsquo;s priority is that any decision taken by Bank of America will have minimal impact on employees at the Carrick on Shannon operation and ensure that jobs are maintained at the facility. Minister Bruton emphasised this when he met with Senior Bank of America Executives in their Headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.  IDA Ireland is in regular contact with Bank of America management in Dublin and with the parent company in the US to monitor developments.  IDA met with senior executives of Apollo in London in September 2013 where the transfer of the Carrick facility and staff to Apollo, and further investment opportunities for the group in Ireland, were discussed.</p><p>  IDA will remain in contact with the company and will continue to highlight the strengths of the Carrick operation to a broad range of potential investors.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300052#WRA01400"><p>I have been informed by IDA Ireland that in respect of job announcements, they are tracked on a calendar basis and not by region.  In the period from 2008- 2010 there were 176 announcements, while in the period from 2011- 2013 there were 221 announcements, an increase of 25%, an increase with which I am pleased as foreign direct investment (FDI) is key to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery. I have arranged to have copies of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s announcements for each year from 2008 to 2013 supplied to the Deputy.</p><p>  For a variety of reasons many IDA Ireland sponsored investments proceed without announcement.  I would like to say that while IDA Ireland&rsquo;s investment announcements are indicative of the improvement in our economic performance since this Government came to office, a better indicator by far are the Agency&rsquo;s recently announced End of Year Results.  Those results show that in 2013, 164 investments were secured and a record 7,071 net new jobs were created, the highest job creation figures in over a decade.  There are now over 161,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s history </p><p>  At the end of 2013 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland client companies, are located outside of Dublin and Cork.  This figure includes those companies that were heretofore Shannon Development client companies.</p><p>  It must be acknowledged that some locations outside of Dublin and the main urban areas already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investment won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  Indeed during 2013, there were some very big announcements in regional locations such as Dundalk, Limerick and Waterford.</p><p>  I am, of course, concerned at the lack of investment in certain regional locations and I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p>  Finally I have appointed Frank Ryan, former Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Ireland to be Chairperson of the board of IDA Ireland with effect from 1 January 2014.  Given his previous experience in supporting enterprise development in this country while working in both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, he is ideally placed to oversee the next phase of growth in the multinational; sector.  I have every confidence that under his Chairmanship, the multinational sector can continue the strong growth which has been so crucial to our economic recovery in recent years. I look forward to working with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and officials of my Department in developing strategies for the enhancement of enterprise and jobs in the regional locations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300052#WRA01600"><p>The Government is totally committed to the retention and expansion of our Manufacturing sector. The new Manufacturing Strategy, which I launched last year sets out an ambitious target to create an additional 20,000 jobs by 2016 and a range of actions are underway to drive that target.  It is very heartening that after several years of significant job losses in that sector, job levels are now rising.  However within that manufacturing sector there are many different sub sectors and some face greater challenges than others.  The aircraft engine maintenance sector is one of those facing a particularly difficult set of circumstances due to global factors, including over capacity in the industry and changing dynamics in the way the players interact.</p><p>  With regard to skills specifically for manufacturing, I also commissioned a detailed report, prepared last year by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs/Forfas and this identified key actions to help ensure that the required skills are available for the sector. Work is in hand to drive those actions, particularly with the various educational and training bodies.    </p><p>  In relation to Lufthansa, IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, has been actively seeking to attract new employment opportunities for the workers being made redundant. The agencies have been targeting existing and prospective clients highlighting the skills and capabilities of these employees as a key attractor. The Agencies have had on-going engagement with the relevant educational bodies to evaluate potential training and up-skilling supports for these employees. Despite extremely difficult global market conditions in that particular sector, every effort is being made to help attract alternative employment opportunities. </p><p>  While we do have several companies thriving in various aspects of aircraft maintenance, employing about 4,000 staff, including two very successful companies at Dublin Airport and another Lufthansa operation in Shannon, the engine casing repair companies have been under very severe pressure, largely due to global changes. </p><p>  Given the various global pressures and factors which arise from time to time for specific sectors and sub-sectors of industry, and the free-market business environment in which we operate, it is not possible to ensure that in the case of every closure, that mechanisms are in place to ensure that immediate re-employment of staff who have been made redundant.  However every effort is made by the relevant State bodies to mitigate the adverse impacts involved and to try to ensure that re-employment opportunities are maximised. This is particularly important in the case of high skilled employees.</p></reply>

There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.</p><p>  While I am, of course, disappointed that IDA Ireland has failed to meet the very ambitious target of 50%, the result for 2013 at 30% is ahead of the outcome of 25% in 2012 indicating a positive trend in terms of new investment in the Regions.  I should point out that 72,500 people, roughly 44% of the total employment in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s base of companies including those that were former clients of Shannon Development, are located outside of Dublin and Cork. </p><p>  It must be acknowledged that some locations outside of Dublin and the main urban centres already facilitate the presence of a large number of multinational companies who have invested over the years, span multiple sectors and employ significant amounts of people.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland is from the existing client base.  Indeed during 2013, there were some very big announcements in regional locations such as Dundalk, Limerick and Waterford. </p><p>  I am, of course, concerned at the lack of investment in certain regional locations and I have, accordingly, requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014. </p><p>  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p>  Finally, I have appointed Frank Ryan, former Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Ireland to be Chairperson of the board of IDA Ireland with effect from 1 January 2014.  Given his previous experience in supporting enterprise development in this country while working in both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, he is ideally placed to oversee the next phase of growth in the multinational; sector.  I have every confidence that under his Chairmanship, the multinational sector can continue the strong growth which has been so crucial to our economic recovery in recent years. I look forward to working with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and officials of my Department in developing strategies for the enhancement of enterprise and jobs in the regional locations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300052#WRA02000"><p>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 implemented EU Council Directive 97/81/EC into Irish law.  The purpose of the Directive was to implement the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by the European cross-industry organisations UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC.</p><p>  The purpose of the Framework Agreement, which was annexed to the Directive, was to eliminate discrimination against part-time employees and to improve the quality of part-time work.  It also aimed to facilitate the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and to contribute to the flexible organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and employees.</p><p>  Accordingly, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides a wide degree of protection for part-time employees, including the general protection that a part-time employee shall not be treated in a less favourable manner in respect of his/her conditions of employment than a full time employee.</p><p>  With regard to employees on zero hours contracts, who are a category of part-time employee, I note that these contracts must be entered into freely by the employer and the employee &ndash; one cannot be forced upon an employee.  Zero hours contracts are normally found in sectors such as retail, healthcare and hospitality.  I am very conscious that in<font color="#FF0000"> </font>certain circumstances, they may be of great benefit to both employers and employees.  They allow greater flexibility for both, reducing the employer&rsquo;s pay costs, while workers can decide when and if they want to work.  Such contracts may be preferred by employees who require flexibility to facilitate educational or other personal requirements and banning such contracts could do a disservice to these workers.  However, this is an area I will keep under review.</p><p>  Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 contains a specific protection for such employees.  The zero hours protection applies to all employees whose contract operates to require them to be available whether they work on a casual basis or not.  It covers situations where, for example, an employee is sent home if things are quiet or is requested to be available for work and is not, on the day, asked to work.  Where an employee suffers a loss by not working hours he/she was requested to work or be available to work, the zero hours provisions of the Act ensure that he/she is compensated for 25% of the time which he/she is required to be available or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser.  The level of compensation may be impacted if the employee got some work.  Claims of breaches of section 18 may be referred to a rights commissioner.</p><p>  An expectation of work does not, however, entitle an employee to compensation.  The zero hours provision does not apply to lay-offs, short-time, emergency or exceptional circumstances, employee illness, employee on-call or where the employee is paid wages for making him/herself available for work.</p><p>  Sections 17 and 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act may also be of particular interest to employees on zero hour contracts.  Section 17 sets out the requirements regarding notification to the employee of the times at which he/she will be required to work during the week. Generally, an employee is entitled to 24 hours&rsquo; notice of his/her roster for the week, although section 17(4) allows for changes as a result of unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>  Section 19 sets out an employee&rsquo;s entitlement to paid annual leave equal to 4 working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment) or one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours or 8 per cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).</p></reply>

A joint Irish EIB High Level Working Group (HLWG) was established to identify concrete and flexible mechanisms to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda. The EIB and Ireland are strongly committed to working together to enhance the Bank&rsquo;s activity in the country and this commitment is beginning to bear results with increase contacts at many levels.</p><p>  Total funding, by the EIB Group to Irish projects in 2013 was &euro;1.193 billion, representing a 21% increase on 2012 levels, including funding for SMEs in the form of &euro;200 million in loans to AIB targeted specifically at SMEs.  </p><p>  In addition to securing a higher level of funding for Irish projects in 2013 than in 2012, funding went to a larger number and broader range of projects than in previous years including infrastructure projects, with loans to the University of Limerick, the Grangegorman PPP, Irish Schools Programme, the Dublin Cross City Luas Project and the N11/N7 Motorway. EIB support has also been secured in the renewable energy sector including a loan to AIB for small to medium renewable energy projects in Ireland; the Bord G&aacute;is Onshore Wind Programme, which consists of the construction and operation of six onshore wind farms located in Ireland, and the ESB Renewable Connection. Moreover, there was specific support for micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the form of a loan to AIB for &euro;100m. Furthermore, the European Investment Fund (EIF) has supported the recently announced Development Capital Scheme in Ireland and has continued its support for the Microenterprise Loan Fund managed by Microfinance Ireland.</p><p>  Close engagement between Ireland and the EIB will continue in 2014 with a number of proposals being discussed between the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the EIB for further support of Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda. For example, as announced in Budget 2014, given the importance of the export sector to sustainable economic growth and employment, officials from my Department and Enterprise Ireland, as well as well as the Department of Finance, are in discussions with the EIB on the feasibility of an EIB-supported trade finance initiative which would proactively support Irish exporters in growing their businesses abroad. Work in support of this will feature in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p><p>  The EIB support for Ireland&rsquo;s growth agenda will contribute to job creation and will complement this Government&rsquo;s drive for job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs in the coming year.</p></reply>

Since the Oireachtas Committee Report was issued in October 2012, a study undertaken for the European Commission in April 2013 projects that there may be up to 900,000 ICT job vacancies in Europe by 2015. In addition, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) published a report in November 2013 which projects that there will be more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>  Almost half of applications for new Employment Permits during 2013 were from applicants with critical ICT skills, both within and beyond the ICT sector itself. The Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2013 committed to delivering a range of additional measures to streamline and simplify the Employment Permit application process, with shortages in the ICT sector specifically in mind. These have all been delivered. </p><p>  For example, an ICT Green Card employment permit application may now be made in respect of all sectors of the economy, not just in the ICT sector itself, in recognition that ICT skills are in short supply across the economy. An Intra-Company Transfer Permit holder or a Contract Service Provider Employment Permit holder can now apply for other types of Employment Permits. The &euro;30,000 salary threshold for IT Graduates (both graduates of Irish and foreign colleges) has been reduced to &euro;27,000, as well as for Specialist Language Support &amp;amp; Technical or Sales Support with fluency in a non-EEA language for client companies of the Enterprise Development Agencies, many of which are in respect of ICT skills. This year, the application process is being enhanced by the development of a &lsquo;Trusted Partner Registration Scheme&rsquo; to allow fast tracking of applications for employment in selected enterprises that are enterprise agency clients.  </p><p>  Other changes to the application process, which include moving the Employment Permits call centre to NERA and the introduction an eForm, have reduced processing times for issue of Employment Permits by an average of 33% over the course of 2013. </p><p>  Together with the Minister for Education and Skills, I am currently developing a new ICT Action Plan, informed by the progress to date in implementing the measures under the first ICT Action Plan, and the EGFSN Report. That report presents new demand scenarios for high level ICT skills to 2018. The Plan will bring together actions by industry, education providers and the state sector to meet the challenge of ICT skills shortages, with an expected launch date shortly.  The focus of the new Plan will be on building the supply of graduates and skilled professionals with core ICT/electronic engineering qualifications at honours degree level and above.</p><p>  Whilst I have no plans to introduce a Technology Permit, I am pleased that the scope of the new ICT Action Plan is being broadened to encompass measures to increase the supply of highly skilled and experienced ICT professionals from abroad, to meet expected skills demand in the short term.  I also intend to bring before the Houses an Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill during this session to underpin an employment permits regime, specifically focussed on plugging skills gaps and minimising their impact on enterprise growth.  I am confident that the changes to the application requirements specific to the Highly Skilled Occupations &ndash; which includes ICT skills - will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination for ICT professionals and their families.</p></reply>

Over recent years IDA Ireland held constant engagement with the company in an effort to help them deal with various issues and challenges. Unfortunately the company were faced with declining revenues and shrinking international opportunities and, following an extensive company review which was carried out, they took the decision to close several plants worldwide, including the Irish engine casing facility in Rathcoole.  Lufthansa&rsquo;s other aircraft maintenance operation based in Shannon continues to operate. </p><p>  The reasons for this closure are complex; modern aircraft engines require less maintenance, the aircraft manufacturers and the engine manufacturers now play a greater role in determining where maintenance is carried out, competition from lower cost Asian centres is intense and it is, or course, a very mobile and globalised industry. There have been new entrants into the sector and, in addition, currency movements have further increased competitive pressures. </p><p>  In relation to State Investment in the Rathcoole operation over the years, total grant aid paid to the company in respect of Employment, Capital, Research and Development and Training since 1978 was &euro;10.7m. There is no contingent liability to the State in respect of these grants. </p><p>  Regarding the site and buildings, while the Lufthansa company own key parts of the plant, other external companies own some peripheral parts of the overall site. A potential new operator would obviously have to come to an acceptable arrangement with the current owners. The IDA is actively pursuing the attraction of potential new investors to take over the plant and have created a profile of the workforce and their skills, for marketing purposes.</p><p>  With regard to licences/permits, maintenance organisation approvals are issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 of 20 November 2003 as amended, annex II, Part 145. Up until December 2011, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) approved and provided the required certification for Lufthansa Airmotive Ireland Ltd for its Irish based operation. However, in accordance with the legislation (EU Regulation 216/2008), a single approval can include several different plants in different countries, i.e. approval from the Member State of the principle place of business is sufficient for a subsidiary in another Member State. The IAA approval certificate for Lufthansa Airmotive Ireland Ltd was returned to the IAA in December 2011, following a rationalisation program to bring all of the Lufthansa subsidiaries under German authority approval. This process commenced in July 2011.</p></reply>

Broadly speaking, the Action Plan for Jobs envisages that an extra 20,000 jobs can be created in manufacturing activities, while 30,000 jobs can be created in internationally traded services.  These will support a further 50,000 new indirect jobs in the economy.</p><p>  The latest employment statistics published by the Central Statistics Office (26<sup>th</sup>  November 2013) show that employment increased by 58,000 in the year to Quarter 3 2013.  Increases in employment have been recorded in eight of the fourteen economic sectors categorised by the CSO, including a number which are targeted for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Agriculture, ICT, and Accommodation and Food services. </p><p>  The Government is tackling the issue of youth opportunities in the labour market through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  Through these strategies, the Government has brought in a range of new initiatives such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, JobsPlus, and the ICT Action Plan, to help people to upskill or enter employment.  These schemes provide opportunities for all people who are unemployed, including young people.</p><p>  The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs, which will be published shortly following its approval by Government, will include a number of additional measures to support youth employment.</p><p>  Through the Action Plans for Jobs in 2012 and 2013, the Government has focussed on measures aimed at restoring our competitiveness position and creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland.  Ireland is rated highly internationally as one of the best countries in the world in which to do business, and we have built a strong competitive basis on which to compete on global markets.  Ireland has moved up to 17<sup>th</sup> place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013, having being ranked 24<sup>th</sup> only 2 years ago.  Ireland is ranked 15<sup>th</sup>  in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2014 report, while Forbes magazine recently named Ireland as the &ldquo;best country for business&rdquo;, up from sixth position in the previous year.</p><p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, we must continue to do more to ensure that these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover.

Household products on sale in the Irish market, including sofas and mattresses, come within this requirement. </p><p>  I am aware of the recent allegations of the sale of non-compliant products on the UK market and I am informed that the National Consumer Agency (NCA) has been following up with UK product safety authorities. The Agency has also been engaging with relevant retailers to determine whether the affected products were sold on the Irish market and what appropriate follow-up is required. </p><p>  The NCA is the competent authority for market surveillance of consumer products and follows up any complaints received. In the region of 400 / 500 calls are dealt with each year in relation to potential product safety issues across a wide range of products. A very small proportion of such calls (3/4 per year) have related to potential furniture safety issues. In one case, the importation of a large consignment of sofas was intercepted by the Customs Authorities and, following investigation by the NCA, it was determined that the consignment did not meet requirements and was returned to the country of origin. </p><p>  In the context of investigating the adherence of products to the relevant standards, the NCA, on occasions, sends sample products for testing to accredited test houses. There are no such test houses in Ireland for the product safety legislation for which the Agency has responsibility, and as a consequence such testing must be carried out abroad.</p></reply>

The Draft Scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill has been approved by Government for priority drafting. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting is underway.

To this effect, there is on-going dialogue between relevant Ministers and officials, North and South, to promote economic development, job creation and innovation on a cross-border basis.</p><p>  From my own perspective, I attend meetings, of the North South Ministerial Council Plenary, which are hosted by either the Taoiseach or the First and Deputy First Ministers, most recently in November last. In addition, I co-chair meetings of the North South Ministerial Council Trade and Business Development Sectoral, with my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Ms. Arlene Foster MLA. The most recent such meeting was held just yesterday, in Armagh, when we discussed a range of issues of mutual interest on enterprise and business development in both our jurisdictions.  These included a review of various cross-border initiatives being undertaken by <i>InterTradeIreland</i>  , the North/South Trade and Business Development Body, and senior executives of that body participated in the discussions.</p><p>  My officials also engage in on-going dialogue with their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (D&rsquo;ETI). A key area of such regular engagement is on the oversight of <i>InterTradeIreland</i>, which is co-funded by my Department and our counterpart Northern Ireland Department. <i>InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s</i>  suite of programmes is designed to encourage trade and business growth across the island and create an environment where it is easier to do cross-border business.  These programmes include:</p><p><i>Elevate</i>   &ndash; which focuses on helping micro enterprises to take the first steps in exporting and explore opportunities in a new cross-border market;</p><p><i>Challenge</i>   - which helps SMES realise their ambitions to become more innovative; </p><p><i>Innova</i>   - a cross-border collaborative Research &amp;amp; Development programme offering companies an opportunity to accelerate new product, process or service developments through partnering with a company in the other jurisdiction; and</p><p><i>Fusion</i>   - a unique technology transfer programme which provides companies with new product or process development needs access to a three-way partnership that includes a third-level research institution with specialist expertise.</p><p>  In addition, my Department co-funds a total of 28 projects under the Enterprise Development theme of the Interreg IVA Programme (2009-2015), together with both the administration in Northern Ireland and the EU.  These projects include addressing barriers to trade faced by micro-enterprises in border counties, assisting with market entry support, developing cross border linkages, business support mentoring, capacity building for SMEs, schemes for assisting specific enterprise sectors, the provision of two Enterprise Centres and the provision a major Science Park. </p><p>  Also, there is close engagement and cooperation between the relevant Enterprise Development bodies which come under the remit of my Department, i.e. <i>Enterprise Ireland </i>and the <i>County Enterprise Boards</i>    with their counterparts in Northern Ireland on a range of mutually beneficial issues. </p><p>  We will continue to work diligently with our counterparts in Northern Ireland to increase the economic benefits - especially on trade development, research and innovation and job creation - which can accrue from practical cross-border co-operation. </p></reply>

Our youth unemployment rate, for persons under 25 years of age, reached over 30% in 2012.    </p><p>  The Government has been tackling the issue of youth employment through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  Through these strategies, the Government has brought in a range of new initiatives such as JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, JobsPlus, and the ICT Action Plan, to help people to upskill or enter employment.  These schemes provide opportunities for all people who are unemployed, including young people.</p><p>  It is encouraging to see that, as the early signs of an economic recovery begin to emerge, there has been an improvement in the number of young people at work.  The youth unemployment rate decreased from 31.1% to 26.5% over the year to the Third Quarter of 2013.  However, this rate is still far too high and it is important that we continue on our course to turn the economy around so that we create more job opportunities for all who want to work. </p><p>  I am currently finalising the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and I can confirm that it will include a number of measures to support youth employment.  For example, my Department, together with Enterprise Ireland, is examining options for initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, which could include a range of supports for business start-ups by young people under 25 years of age.  </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs will be published shortly, following its approval by the Government.</p></reply>

Potential demand from SMEs is very difficult to assess and for this reason I did not set lending targets for the Schemes.</p><p>  As of 17 January, 2014 Microfinance Ireland (MFI), has approved 149 applications to the value of &euro;2.32m supporting 333 jobs.  </p><p>  Take-up to date may be a reflection of the muted level of demand for credit as evidenced in the Department of Finance commissioned SME Credit Demand Surveys.</p><p>  My Department and the Microenterprise Loan Fund operator, MFI have committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of this Fund. While my officials engage with MFI on an on-going basis in how the Fund is being delivered, I will commence a review of the operation of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Acts 2012 by July 2014.  The purpose of the review will be to enhance the uptake and impact of the Fund and I can assure the Deputy that I will take all recommendations into consideration with a view to improving the overall take-up of the Fund.</p><p>  As of 17 January, 2014 the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme has 77 live facilities resulting in &euro;10.5m being sanctioned through the scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 408 new jobs being created and 247 jobs being maintained.</p><p>  As take-up continued to be lower than anticipated, I commissioned an independent review of the Scheme, which was submitted to me in Q3 2013. Since then my Department has worked with the Review Steering Group to determine the changes that can to be made to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and the contents of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme, on foot of this review. This complex work is progressing as quickly as is practicable. The review also contained a number of recommendations outside of the legal framework such as awareness raising that can be pursued without the need for legislative changes. In addition, my Department has been working with the Irish Banking Federation to determine the likely take-up of the revised Scheme. </p><p>  I will ensure these changes to the Credit Guarantee Scheme are made in 2014 through the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and I will implement the review recommendations, as appropriate, with a view to enhancing the up-take and impact of the Scheme as soon as possible.</p></reply>

General Comments provide guidelines for States Parties on the interpretation of specific aspects of the Convention and clarify the normative content of the rights set out therein.</p><p>  According to paragraph 2 of the General Comment the human right to water entitles everyone to &ldquo;<i>sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses. An adequate amount of safe water is necessary to prevent death from dehydration, to reduce the risk of water-related disease and to provide for consumption, cooking, personal and domestic hygienic requirements.</i>  &rdquo;</p><p>  Although the General Comment makes no reference to the phrase <i>&ldquo;drinkable water&rdquo; </i>the water required for each personal or domestic use must, according to paragraph 12(b) of the General Comment, be   <i>&ldquo;safe, therefore free from micro-organisms, chemical substances and radiological hazards that constitute a threat to a person&rsquo;s health. Furthermore, water should be of an acceptable colour, odour and taste for each personal or domestic use&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Paragraph 37 of the General Comment of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights confirms that States Parties have a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of minimum essential levels of each of the rights enunciated in the Covenant. In the Committee&rsquo;s view, one of the core obligations in relation to the right to water is &ldquo;<i>to ensure physical access to water facilities or services that provide sufficient, safe and regular water; that have a sufficient number of water outlets to avoid prohibitive waiting times; and that are at a reasonable distance from the household</i>  &rdquo;. </p><p>  With regard to drinking water quality, the EU Drinking Water Directive has been transposed under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007.  Those regulations provide that all suppliers of drinking water must ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean.  Water that is wholesome and clean is defined as water that:</p><p>-  Is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and </p><p>-  Meets the quality standards specified in Tables A and B in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Regulations.    </p><p>  A copy of the Regulations is available in the Oireachtas library.</p></reply>

This might take into account, inter alia, their previous actions on the same subject or previous engagement with the same country.

I made clear and demonstrated my support for the process and my willingness to meet with participants throughout.  </p><p>  I believe that my engagement, and that of the Taoiseach, with all Parties over the past number of months has been helpful not only in the context of ongoing work in relation to the Haass proposals but is also very valuable in terms of strengthening and deepening Government relations across the NI Executive.  </p><p>  Throughout the Talks, I have made clear to all participants and stakeholders the Government&rsquo;s view that there is now a unique opportunity to make further progress towards advancing reconciliation and the creation of a truly reconciled and prosperous society in Northern Ireland.    That remains the Government&rsquo;s view and we will continue our engagement with the Northern Ireland Political Parties and the British Government to that end.  </p><p>  While acknowledging that the issues to be addressed in the talks are difficult and contentious, the Government encouraged the parties to be ambitious in their approach.  I welcome that very significant progress was made within the talks process over a short period on a number of the most difficult issues that face society in Northern Ireland.  The priority now should be to safeguard and give practical effect to what has been achieved.   </p><p>  Since New Year, I have maintained contact with all of the party leaders and have made clear my intention of engaging closely with them as they seek to conclude their important work on what are some of the most divisive issues in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  I welcome that the five parties in the NI Executive have been meeting to discuss and agree the next steps.</p><p>  The Government will play its role to the full in partnership with the NI Parties to the full as they complete their work on an agreement.</p><p>In regard to specific contacts, I have spoken with all the party leaders since the talks concluded.  I met with the first Minister and Deputy first Minister and hope to have an opportunity to speak with each again shortly.  I have had numerous discussions with Secretary of State <b>Theresa Villiers</b>   and met with her in Hillsborough last week.    I believe there is a shared sense of purpose on the part of both governments to see this process brought to an early conclusion.</p></reply>

The core activities of NewERA since its establishment have been:  advising on the disposal or restructuring of State assets; activities to facilitate investment in economic infrastructure; and provision of corporate finance and governance advice in respect of certain State entities and assets.</p><p>  These activities have involved NewERA providing independent corporate finance advice and financial analysis to Government on a range of issues across its remit and actively engaging with relevant stakeholders and Government Departments. Its work to date includes the following:</p><p><b>State Asset Disposals </b></p><p>  NewERA is advising the Government in relation to the sale of BGE's energy business. A consortium comprising Centrica plc, Brookfield Renewable Power Inc and iCON Infrastructure was selected on 12 December as the preferred bidder for the business.</p><p>  NewERA provided advice to the relevant Government Departments in relation to the sale in November 2013 of ESB's 50% shareholding in UK-based Marchwood Power Ltd where it achieved a price above expectations and which, it is anticipated, will realise &euro;140 million in dividends for the Exchequer this year.</p><p>  Following the June 2013 Government decision in relation to Coillte, the restructuring of the company will be overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder departments. NewERA is also undertaking further financial analysis to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte (this will involve analysing possible synergies between the investment programmes of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte).</p><p><b>Activities to Facilitate Investment in Economic Infrastructure</b></p><p>  NewERA has also been working with the relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders on investment initiatives in the areas of water, energy retrofit, export wind and broadband.</p><p><b>Corporate Finance and Governance Advice</b></p><p>  NewERA has provided detailed financial analysis and recommendations (where appropriate) to relevant Ministers on requests for Ministerial consents received from the relevant commercial State entities (ESB, Bord Gais Eireann, Bord na M&oacute;na, Coillte and EirGrid)-&quot;CSS&quot; entities. These requests primarily stem from legislative obligations on the CSS entities to seek Ministerial approval (e.g. for an entity to borrow) or arise under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. This analysis includes (where appropriate) a financial review of the relevant CSS entity's capital investment programmes.</p><p>  NewERA has begun the process of reviewing the dividend policies of the CSS entities and has provided advice to the relevant Government Departments on a revised dividend policy for ESB, which was announced by ESB on 23 October 2013, and which provides for an increased dividend pay out to the State from 2015.  </p><p><b>Current status</b></p><p>  In June 2013 the Government announced legislative proposals for putting NewERA on a statutory basis and the Heads of the NTMA (Amendment) Bill which will, inter alia, put NewERA on a statutory footing are with the Office of the Attorney General for drafting. This Bill will also provide for the establishment of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) by reorienting the National Pensions Reserve Fund and making the &euro;6.4 billion in the Fund's discretionary portfolio available for commercial investment in Ireland.</p><p>  An interdepartmental Steering Group (chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform) has been tasked with reviewing the options of of moving to a full holding company structure for the ownership of commercial State companies with the Group to report to Government on the matter in due course.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses. However, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.</p><p>  The idea of making flood insurance compulsory has been considered. However, it would mean that in areas where there was likely to be regular flooding, the cost of insurance would almost certainly be prohibitive and could make premiums unaffordable for policyholders in general.</p><p>  On the question of legislation, the Government has also examined the introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance in respect of flooding from regular insurance bodies. However, this approach was not considered financially viable because it was believed that over time it would incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.</p><p>  What the Government can do, however, is try to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works (OPW) is committed to doing all it can to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on floor relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.</p><p>  Most of the damage arising from the recent stormy weather was in coastal counties in the West and South.  OPW, along with other relevant Departments and Offices, will be providing financial support to local authorities in relation to the repair of public infrastructure damaged in the storms. In OPW's case the support will relate to damaged coastal flood defence structures such as rock armour revetments, sea walls.</p><p>  In relation to the issue of the provision of flood cover in areas where the OPW has carried out flood relief works, the OPW and Insurance Ireland have been engaged in discussions to agree on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW, or in certain instances by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.  These parties have reached agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies.</p><p>  The outcome of these discussions means that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will, therefore, be in a position to provide the necessary flood cover to householders in such areas. In cases where individuals which are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact the Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at </p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, banks display in their branches a list of certain charges.  Under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended), credit Institutions and bureaux de change must notify the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank) if they wish to introduce any new customer charge for providing a service or increase any existing customer charge for providing a service.  The Central Bank assesses these charges based on four criteria set out in the legislation:</p><p>  - The promotion of fair competition;</p><p>  - The commercial justification submitted in respect of the proposal;</p><p>  - The impact new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers;</p><p>  - Passing on costs to customers. </p><p>  The Central Bank may either approve or reject an institution s application under Section 149. An institution may choose however, not to apply charges for which it already has approval for commercial or competitive reasons and then subsequently apply such charges at its own discretion.  In this regard these concessions are not subject to a Section 149 notification i.e. an institution may choose to apply such internal account structures at its own discretion and so the Central Bank has no power in this area to approve/reject such revisions.  The National Consumer Agency provides comparison tools for financial products including current accounts on its website .  I would strongly advise consumers to use this site if they are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost of fees.  The Code of Conduct on the Switching of Current Accounts with Credit Institutions is available on the Central Bank's website at .  This simplifies the switching of current accounts between Credit Institutions for the consumer.</p></reply>

There is no equivalent scheme in Northern Ireland.  Under the rebate scheme, the amount of the repayment will vary in accordance with the average price at which auto-diesel is available for purchase in the State during a repayment period, subject to a maximum of 7.5 cents per litre.  The rebate rate applicable for the current repayment period is 6.2 cents per litre.</p><p>  The scheme is available to qualifying road transport operators established in the State and in the EU who are tax compliant and properly licensed and who purchase diesel in the State for use in a qualifying vehicle.  Qualifying vehicles, in the case of passenger vehicles, are vehicles that conform to certain classifications under EU law and that are engaged in the lawful carriage of persons, including buses, coaches and certain minibuses.</p><p>  The auto-diesel for rebate must have been purchased by the qualifying road transport operators either in bulk (a quantity of 2,000 litres or more), or by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered to a premises or place that is under the control of a qualifying road transport operator.  These purchasing restrictions are necessary for the management and control of the repayment scheme by Revenue, to minimize the risk of abuse.  In addition to the diesel rebate scheme, it should also be borne in mind that the rate of mineral oil tax on auto-diesel in Ireland is considerably lower than in Northern Ireland; &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres compared with &euro;695.93 in Northern Ireland at the current exchange rate.</p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT in Ireland under paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.  In this respect, services provided by the coach and bus sector are exempt from VAT.  This means that a person who provides a bus or coach service does not register for VAT and does not charge VAT on the supply of their services.  This also includes the hiring of a bus or coach with a driver.  Persons who are exempt from VAT cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services, such as fuel, that are used for the purposes of the person's coach and bus service.</p><p>  An Irish coach or bus service operator may be entitled to a VAT deduction when that operator engages in the transport outside the State of passengers and their accompanying baggage.  This is defined as qualifying activities in section 59 of the Value-Added Tax Act 2010.  For example, an Irish coach operator who incurs Irish VAT on diesel that is used in the transport of passengers in Northern Ireland will be entitled to a deduction for the portion of the VAT that relates to transport in Northern Ireland.  A Northern Ireland coach operator who is engaged in the transport within this State of passengers and their accompanying baggage will be entitled to claim a deduction for UK VAT on diesel purchases, since transport services there are zero rated, but is not entitled to any refund of Irish VAT incurred on the purchase of diesel in the State.</p><p>  I would point out that VAT law in Ireland and the UK must comply with the EU VAT Directive.  As passenger transport was exempt in Ireland on 1 January 1978, it is possible under the VAT Directive to continue to apply that exemption.  As passenger transport services were charged at the zero rate in the UK on 1 January 1991, the UK are entitled to continue to apply a zero rate to passenger transport services.  It is not possible under EU law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to such services as we did not apply a zero rate to them in 1991.  Given the lower mineral oil tax on auto-diesel in the State and the diesel rebate scheme, I am satisfied that operators in the State are not at a competitive disadvantage compared with operators based in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased to address the risk of abuse of the scheme. In order to qualify for the repayment, the auto-diesel must be purchased by the qualifying road transport operator, either in bulk (a quantity over 2,000 litres), or by means of a fuel card approved by Revenue for that purpose.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered to a premises or place that is under the control of a qualifying road transport operator.</p><p>  These provisions are necessary for the management and control of the repayment scheme by Revenue.  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that licensed mineral oil traders are required to make under Revenue's fuel supply chain controls.  Revenue will only approve a fuel card where they are satisfied that the fuel card provider will supply them with the information required by Revenue about purchases of auto-diesel by means of that card.  Revenue would not have access to this information for fuel purchased at the pump by means other than a fuel card.  There are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel card services to road transport operators and forecourt operators.  The scheme was the subject of considerable discussion with the haulage sector and I believe the current arrangements strike the right balance between facilitating the legitimate haulage sector and preventing fraudulent claims. Revenue will monitor the scheme closely and will continue to engage with the sectors involved.</p></reply>

Some Asian and Middle-Eastern investors, along with others in Europe including German insurance companies, are now likely to be in a position to buy Irish Government debt. An increase in the market participants and demand for Irish bonds should lead to a reduction in yields.</p><p>  Market reaction to the Moody s announcement has initially been positive with the yield on the new benchmark 2024 bond quoted at 3.24% (as of Wednesday 22 January, 9am), some 21 basis points lower than the Friday 17 January  trading session close. The reduction in sovereign yields should also have a positive impact on the rates at which the commercial semi-state bodies (ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, etc.) can borrow.</p><p>  This was the first rating change by Moody s since it cut Ireland s rating to sub-investment grade in July 2011. Moody s cited two reasons for the upgrade: (i) the growth potential of the Irish economy, which together with ongoing fiscal consolidation is expected to bring government debt ratios down from their recent peak; and (ii) the Irish government s exit from its EU/IMF support programme on schedule, with improved solvency and restored market access. </p><p>  In addition to the increase in the rating, Moody's also upgraded the outlook for Ireland to positive. This is significant as it signals that Moody's are prepared to look at another upgrade for Ireland, possibly over the space of the next eighteen months. </p><p>  All in all, this is good news for Ireland and will help to ensure that the momentum of economic and fiscal recovery is maintained. I would in particular like to compliment, in this House, the hard work done by the National Treasury Management Agency, during the dark days when we were effectively locked out of the markets, in spreading the message that Ireland  was dealing with its problems and in paving the way for our return to normal market financing.</p></reply>

Recent examples of this include the development of Islamic Finance and Green Finance initiatives, attracting new business lines to the Irish market.</p><p>  A European Central Bank publication in June 2013 confirmed that Ireland is now a significant location for Islamic funds, with an estimated 20% of the Islamic funds market outside of the Middle East being located here. The first Irish domiciled Shari a-compliant UCIT was established in 2012 by CIMB Islamic Asset Management and this product is now offered in the UK, Germany and France under the UCITS EU passport.  At the end of 2013, the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) had some $11bn.  It should be noted that no specific tax reliefs are given for Islamic funds, and the tax measures for specified financial transactions introduced in Finance Act 2010 did not relate to investment funds.  Those provisions related to other types of financial products, and their purpose was to ensure that such financial products structured along Islamic finance principles are taxed in the same way as conventional financial products.</p></reply>

He addressed the Institute of International and European Affairs on Friday 17th January and earlier that day I met him in my Department.   </p><p>  During my meeting with Mr Regling, I updated him on developments in Ireland following the successful exit from the EU/IMF Programme in December, including the very successful bond issuance by the NTMA on the 7th of January.  We also discussed recent developments in the Eurozone and the future prospects.</p><p>  We issued the following agreed statement at the end of the meeting: &quot;Ireland has undergone a major transformation in recent years and is now well positioned to grow and create jobs in the years ahead. Having been frozen out of the markets in 2010, the commitment of the Irish people and the support of funding from the IMF and the EU including the EFSF (the predecessor to the ESM) enabled Ireland to make the necessary fiscal adjustment over a phased period and to make a full return to the financial markets. The success of the Irish programme is evident and Ireland is now viewed as a safe place to invest. The market reaction to Ireland's exit strategy and in particular the very strong investor appetite for last week's 2024 Bond highlights the positive sentiment towards Ireland in the financial markets.</p><p>  The recovery in the Eurozone is underway and the new architecture put in place since 2010, of which the ESM is a key component, safeguards the stability of the Euro area and will prevent similar crisis occurring in the future. There are many challenges ahead both in Ireland and across the Eurozone and policy makers must ensure that the recovery continues and that the focus is on generating economic growth and jobs.&quot; </p><p>  I understand that a number of  the comments made by Mr Regling during his visit have been widely reported, including those to the effect that the reduction in Ireland's borrowing costs can be attributed at least in part to the decision not to impose losses on senior bank bondholders, and that there was, at this stage, no unanimous support in the euro zone for retroactive recapitalisation of financial institutions.  However, Mr Regling also noted that the timeline involved in this matter was dependant on the SSM coming into being, which is scheduled to come on stream in the latter part of this year.</p><p>  The Eurogroup meeting of 20th  June 2013 agreed on the main features of the ESM's Direct Bank Recapitalisation instrument (DBR). The DBR instrument will come into effect when the Single Supervisory Mechanism is operational. There is a specific provision included in those main features that provides for retroactive recapitalisation. This provision states that: &quot;The potential retroactive application of the instrument should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.&quot; Therefore, the agreement that we were active in negotiating keeps open the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks should we wish to avail of it.  The SSM is expected to be place and operational towards the end of 2014.</p><p>  Finally, as I have previously stated we will ensure that our case for retrospective direct recapitalisation is made at all levels as appropriate.  I remain confident that the commitment made by the Euro-area Heads of State or Government in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns will be respected. It is very clear that there is still a lot of negotiation to be done on this aspect of the facility but the agreement now in place keeps the possibility to apply to the ESM for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks open for us, should we wish to avail of it. </p></reply>

One of the principal recommendations of the Report, which was agreed by all credit union stakeholders, was the establishment of a restructuring board to facilitate and oversee the restructuring of credit unions. The Credit Union and Co-operation  with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 - 2012 Act - established the Credit Union Restructuring Board -ReBo - on a statutory basis from 1 January 2013. The 2012 Act also established the Credit Union Fund and &euro;250 million was contributed by the Government to the Fund to support the restructuring process. </p><p>  The objectives of the restructuring process are to underpin the stability and long-term viability of credit unions and the sector at large and to provide an opportunity for stronger credit unions to develop a more sustainable business model. The restructuring process will be carried out on a voluntary, incentivised and time bound basis. While restructuring will not apply to all credit unions, many credit unions will be able to benefit from the advantages of restructuring such as: achieving economies of scope and scale; securing long term viability and stability; and providing opportunities to expand the range of services to members.  ReBo is working towards the timetable set out in the Commission on Credit Unions Report, with a view to completing the process by the end of 2015.  ReBo is continuing to interact with all credit unions to identify their willingness and suitability to engage in what is a voluntary restructuring process. A number of credit union amalgamations are already underway and indeed completed, with technical assistance from ReBo, for example the recent combination of Balbriggan, Skerries and Donabate to form Progressive Credit Union in north County Dublin.My expectation is that the pace of restructuring under ReBo will accelerate this year towards the completion of the process by the end of 2015.</p></reply>

This Government continues to work to create an environment conducive to the entry of such new entrants primarily through the implementation of policies to promote economic recovery and employment creation but also through different initiatives to ensure that there is an adequate pool of credit to underpin the recovery.  This is a theme common to our EU partners and Ireland has been leading the debate at EU level on the mechanisms to promote, for example, alternative forms of financing for SMEs. It is important though that we establish an environment conducive for banks and alternative credit providers to enter the Irish market and compete. </p><p>  In this regard: we are working to manage and minimise potential market expectations of future State support for the state owned banks which could act as a deterrent to new market entrants; we are working to establish equality in the assessment of credit risk through the establishment of an industry wide credit register to allow for the appropriate measure of risk in lending, allowing incumbent and new lenders to lend with full visibility of the risk of that lending. The Credit Reporting Act was passed at the end of 2013; we are working to reduce switching costs to allow customers to move between banks more easily, enhancing competition and forcing banks to work hard to retain their customers on a commercial basis; we are encouraging risk sharing partnerships to encourage new lending, such as the AIB/European Investment Bank lending initiative; alternative innovative mechanisms to involve other lenders are actively being explored and progressed such as the initiative with the German State Development Bank, KfW; and we are in regular dialogue with potential market entrants as they evaluate potential opportunities in Ireland and will be supportive of new entrants as they emerge. </p><p>  The RBS review by the UK Government confirms the continuing role that Ulster Bank will have in the lending and deposit taking business for all customers here in Ireland. KBC have been expanding their network and their ambitions in Ireland. I believe that it is fair to say that it is not all bad news and that the Irish financial market does offer opportunities to institutions. This Government has also taken steps to ensure that the Irish financial market is accessible to any financial institution considering establishing in Ireland. In seeking to reduce the barriers to entry which are specific to the Irish banking market, Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, which provides for the regulation of bank fees and charges has been disapplied for three years in the case of new financial service providers setting up in Ireland. </p></reply>

Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have now been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgage arrears of more than 90 days in arrears.  </p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears against the 30% target. </p><p>  The new monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department will also provide an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, which is in respect of the end of November, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the number of permanent restructures of permanent dwelling mortgages more than 90 days in arrears has risen from around 41,200 in August to around 49,300 in November 2013, an increase of almost 20%.   </p><p>  The Central Bank's mortgage arrears and restructure statistics for the quarter ending September 2013, published in November (www.centralbank.ie), shows a decline in the total number of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgage accounts in arrears of one per cent compared to the end of June 2013 position.  Within this, early arrears have declined significantly during the reporting period with a quarter-on-quarter fall of six per cent.  The data published by my Department and the Central Bank would appear to demonstrate some success by the lenders in addressing the accounts in early arrears and putting in place appropriate measures to prevent borrowers from going into arrears.</p><p>  It is accepted that the issue of mortgage arrears is a major problem that needs to be resolved, not only for an individual borrower and lender, but also for the long term economic and social health of the country and the Government will ensure that the comprehensive strategy it has put in place to tackle the problem is now fully implemented by all the parties involved in the process.</p></reply>

Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.  In certain cases, such couples also need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example.   The new credit is designed to be an activation measure, which was the original intention behind the OPFTC.  It is designed to be an in-work benefit to support the primary carer to take up, or remain in, employment.  It should not be considered as a supplementary source of income, on which the financial support of a parent depends.   </p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only.  The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  Where a primary carer chooses to relinquish the credit, a secondary carer can make a claim for it provided they meet certain conditions.</p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment, it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  Therefore having completed such an exercise in relation to the OPFTC, I am not minded to reverse the legislative provisions that were approved by the Oireachtas as part of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013.   </p></reply>

Or they may enrol in a mainstream school and attend a special class, or they may enrol in a special </p><p>school.</p><p>  The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school.  My Department has </p><p>no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for </p><p>their child.  The NEWB will try to help parents to find a school placement if their child has been unable to secure a school placement to date.  The NEWB can </p><p>be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate </p><p>educational placements for children with special educational needs.</p><p>  Parents may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs and to seek assistance in identifying placement options, </p><p>using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>  The NCSE also recently published a Guide for Parents and Guardians of Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs on Choosing a School.  This </p><p>guide is also available at www.ncse.ie. </p><p>  Finally, where a parent seeks to enrol their child in a school and that school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil. </p></reply>

However, activity began to increase during the final quarter of 2013, as QQI began to accept new applications from providers, so expenditure from the end of 2013 onwards will revert back to "normal" levels.</p><p>  Its predecessor bodies, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), were allocated a total of &euro;7.714m in 2012.</p><p>  At the end of 2013 QQI employed a total of 84 staff (78.7 on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis) of whom 19 (18.7 FTE) earned above &euro;80,000 per annum.</p><p>  The main statutory functions of QQI, assigned to QQI by the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012, can be summarised as follows: to maintain the National Framework of Qualifications; to agree, and review the effectiveness of, the procedures for quality assurance of education and training established by providers; to validate programmes of education and training; to establish and review the standards of knowledge, skill or competence associated with its awards; to make awards and, where appropriate, delegate authority to make awards to providers; to determine and monitor policies and criteria for access, transfer and progression; to establish a Code of Practice for the provision of education to international learners and the related International Education Mark and to authorise use of the Mark.</p><p>  In addition, QQI has assumed responsibility for a number of other functions undertaken by its predecessor bodies, and therefore serves as the national co-ordinating authority for Europass, ENIC (European Network of Information Centres) and NARIC (National Academic Recognition Information Centre) and as the National Reference Point for vocational education and training; operates Qualifications Recognition Ireland as a single point of contact for all queries concerning the recognition of international awards; maintains Qualifax (www.qualifax.ie), the National Learners Database containing information on approximately 18,000 programmes of education and training; and maintains, on behalf of the Departments of Education and Skills and Justice and Equality, the Internationalisation Register (www.intregister.ie); provides the secretariat for EQAVET (European quality assurance in vocational education and training).</p><p>  QQI currently provides its services to over 1,000 providers of programmes of education and training which lead to awards at every level of the National Framework of Qualifications. In 2012 approximately 170,000 learners in the further education and training sector received QQI/FETAC awards, while approximately 26,000 QQI/HETAC awards were made, either directly by QQI/HETAC or by the Institutes of Technology.</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.  </p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents.</p><p>  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.</p><p>  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p></reply>

The overall value of the measure for the 2013/14 academic year is &euro;16.2m. The management of the Third Level Access Measure Fund rests with the Higher Education Authority and the allocation of funding for the sub-priorities in a particular year is a matter for the authority. The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a local basis by participating higher education institutions and targets those students most in need. The Authority approved in July of this year an allocation for the Student Assistance Fund for the 2013/14 academic year of &euro;8m. Each participating institution was advised of its individual allocation in advance of the academic year in order to facilitate timely planning and disbursement to students.Following agreement with my Department, the HEA, in January 2014, allocated &euro;350,000 of funding to higher education institutions to assist students in severe financial need. This funding is in addition to the &euro;8m allocated in 2013. The &euro;350,000 will be distributed across all higher education institutions that currently receive an SAF allocation and has been allocated in the same way as the core SAF allocation for 2013-14 of &euro;8m. The funding will provide institutions with additional resources to support full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students that are experiencing financial difficulties.</p></reply>

This is a once-off measure to reinstate built coastal defences to their pre-storm condition. The specific application form for this entitled Coastal Storm Damage Flooding Questionnaire 2014 is available on OPW's website <i>www.opw.ie</i> under Flood Risk Management. Any work for which funding is sought will be carried out by the Local Authorities.

At present Contracting Authorities within the State appear to be paying different rates for merchant services to multiple service providers, albeit potentially for different volumes.

The OGP will examine how such merchant service agreements can be purchased more efficiently as part of its programme to secure up to &euro;500 million in cash saving and efficiencies for the taxpayer over the next three years.</p></reply>

Potential flood risk management measures will then be developed and appraised against potential future scenarios (as well as the current) to determine the most appropriate measures for each location and to ensure that the measures set out in the Flood Risk Management Plans (that will be prepared in 2015) will be robust and/or adaptable in the face of potential future changes.</p><p>  In relation to energy usage, the work that is being carried out by the OPW involves the development and implementation of plans and programmes aimed at:</p><p> - maximising the energy performance and increasing the sustainability of new buildings through for example improved design to optimise natural ventilation and the use of renewable technologies where feasible</p><p> - the implementation since 2008 of a very successful energy conservation campaign in existing OPW owned and managed buildings entitled Optimising Power @ Work involving detailed monitoring and recording of energy consumption in 275 large buildings throughout the country and working with staff to effect behavioural change. This initiative has achieved average annual energy savings of over 18% which equates to a cost saving of approximately &euro;4.3m per annum. This initiative is being rolled-out to the wider public sector and will target 500 large buildings with an annual energy saving target rising to 18% after 3 years.</p></reply>

Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad &Eacute;ireann at the last preceding general election or a subsequent bye-election or, in the case of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.  </p><p>  The legislation also provides that payments may be made to a member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, who at the last preceding general election or at a subsequent bye-election was elected as a member other than as a member of a qualifying party. Such qualifying independent TDs are entitled to an allowance, currently amounting to &euro;41,152 per annum.  A similar provision in the Act provides for an allowance currently amounting to &euro;23,383 per annum for independent Senators.  </p><p>  The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses. The allowance is non-taxable and is paid monthly in arrears into a bank account specified by the beneficiary of the allowance. It is not claimed in the same manner as expense allowances. </p><p>  The legislation provides that each party leader must to prepare a statement of expenditure for the party leader s allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor s report to the Standards in Public Office (the Commission) Commission. Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report in relation to the use of the Party Leader's Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas. Allowances paid to independent members are not subject to these oversight provisions</p><p>  I have no plans to discontinue payment of the allowance. Following a review of the allowance and a consultation process with leaders of qualifying political parties, qualifying independent members and with the Standards in Public Office Commission, I published the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013 in October 2013.  The Bill has passed all stages in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is scheduled for Second Stage in this House shortly. </p><p>  The Bill provides for a reduction of 10% in the rates of the allowance, representing an estimated full year Exchequer saving of &euro;0.84 million. The same audit and reporting provisions that will apply to parliamentary leaders will also apply to independent members in receipt of the allowance.  For the first time, independent members will have to record and account for expenditure from the allowance, all of which is to be expended in respect of parliamentary activities, including research. The Bill includes other necessary measures all of which will increase transparency, accountability and ensure citizens can see that their money is being spent as it was intended.</p><p>  The total amounts paid to each qualifying independent TD from 9 March 2011 to end 2013 are set out in Appendix A.

NewERA has, in this context, provided advice on a number of matters including those to which the Deputy's question refers. </p><p>  For example, in the case of Coillte, on foot of the findings of the Inter-Departmental Steering Group established to progress the sale of Coillte harvesting rights, the Government decided last June that it was not the appropriate time to proceed with such a sale, and that the focus should, instead, be on restructuring the company. The Government agreed, inter alia, that:</p><p> - Coillte is to undergo a fundamental restructuring, to be overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments, which will include operational streamlining, financial de-leveraging and a critical examination of the disposal options for its non-core activities such as telecoms and wind; and</p><p> - A robust analysis will also be carried out to evaluate how to give effect to a beneficial merger of Coillte with Bord na Mona to create a streamlined and refocused commercial state company operating in the bio-energy and forestry sectors, as committed to in the Programme for Government. </p><p>  A draft report on the financial costs and benefits of a Coillte/Bord na Mona merger was prepared by NewERA in conjunction with the companies and circulated to relevant Departments in late 2013.  This is currently under discussion with the Departments, and is expected to be finalised shortly and submitted to the relevant Ministers for consideration myself, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minster for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p><p>  In the case of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and also within the context of the relevant inter-Departmental Group(s), NewERA has advised on restructuring required to meet the unbundling requirements of the EU Third Energy Directive, as well as to allow for the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the BGE Group.</p><p>It is, as yet, too early to determine the savings that will be achieved from these restructuring proposals.</p></reply>

It has now developed a presence in the Irish financial market.</p><p>  As of 17 January 2014 MFI, has approved 149 applications to the value of &euro;2.32m supporting 333 jobs.  The latest progress report detailing the analysis and performance for the quarterly period ending 30th September 2013 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  I intend to publish the next progress report for the period to December 2013, once the report has been finalised.</p><p>  The key challenge for MFI is to ensure that people are aware that there is support for new and existing viable micro enterprises with perceived or real higher trading risk that have been refused credit by banks. In that regard MFI has been engaged with key influencers across the country to get that message across. There are on-going promotional and awareness activities to ensure that awareness of the scheme is promoted to its full potential amongst relevant micro business groups across all sectors of business. MFI has also undertaken a number of publicity and awareness raising activities since it began lending, including radio advertisements and attending local business network meetings. In addition, the Minister for Small Business and I promote the scheme at every available opportunity, locally, regionally and nationally. </p><p>  Take-up to date may be a reflection of the muted level of demand for credit as evidenced in the Department of Finance commissioned SME Credit Demand Surveys.</p><p>  My Department and the Microenterprise Loan Fund operator, MFI have committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of this Fund.  While my officials engage with MFI on an on-going basis in how the Fund is being delivered, I will commence a review of the operation of the Microenterprise Loan Fund Acts 2012 by July 2014.  The purpose of the review will be to enhance the uptake and impact of the Fund and I can assure the Deputy that I will take all recommendations into consideration with a view to improving the overall take-up of the Fund.</p></reply>

Start-up companies in particular are a very valuable source of job creation.</p><p>  In support of this mission EI invests in a significant number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), a proportion of these being start-ups in the early stage of development, many developing disruptive new technological applications. Investing in SMEs is inherently risky, particularly so in the case of early stage and seed investments. It should be emphasised that Enterprise Ireland supports companies in an effort to alleviate the market failure for Irish companies in accessing finance. It should also be borne in mind that EI&rsquo;s focus is on the economic return from any investment, i.e. jobs and exports, and not just the financial return.</p><p>  EI, when making an investment, will always seek that the company raises matching funding from the private sector where, at a maximum, Enterprise Ireland accounts for less than fifty percent of any investment. This ensures that the private sector shares a larger proportion of the investment risk. Private sector participation can be from the promoters, private investors and business angels, venture capital or private equity funds. In advance of making an investment, EI undertakes an in-depth commercial evaluation process. </p><p>  The investment write offs for the period 2008 to 2012 can be attributed to companies not achieving market success, in what was a difficult economic period. EI would, in many cases, be writing off investments in line with other private sector investors in any particular company. Equity investment write off over the period 1999 - 2012 (&euro;67m) on foot of investments made over the same period (&euro;427m), represents a 16% write off.  The return from investments in shares for the period 1999 &ndash; 2012 amounted to &euro;376m. The original cost of these shares (including investments written off &euro;67m) amounted to &euro;208m, resulting in a profit of &euro;168m.</p><p>  EI writes off investments where market failure has occurred and a company is being liquidated or wound up.  Before any investment or grant is written off, Enterprise Ireland conducts a thorough due diligence process to ensure that all monies, if any, which are recoverable by EI, have been recovered.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s recovery due diligence process is often carried out in tandem with the recovery processes undertaken by the private sector investors.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the challenges of developing SME&rsquo;s into successful growth companies, Enterprise Ireland client companies continue to have a significant economic impact on the Irish economy, spending more than &euro;19bn per annum and being collectively responsible for more than 300,000 jobs in every county throughout the State. In 2013, EI companies created 18,033 jobs resulting in a net increase of 5,442 jobs. In the same year, EI clients export performance continued to be strong and are expected to rise from the &euro;16.2bn level achieved in 2012. These figures will be published later this year.</p></reply>

There are now over 161,000 people directly employed in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest number in the history of the agency.</p><p>  IDA Ireland markets Ireland as a location for FDI on the basis of a number of selling points viz a pro-business and technologically advanced environment and the availability of an educated and talented English speaking workforce with the blend of appropriate skill sets.  The Agency also offers a range of affordable, state of the art property solutions. Ireland is strategically located between Europe and America and is the only English speaking member of the Eurozone.  Ireland has an attractive corporation tax rate and complies fully with OECD guidelines and EU competition law. Ireland has a good track record of attracting and retaining high quality investments across a range of sectors.  In addition, there is good road access to key cities, ports and international airports. </p><p>  All these factors, together with Ireland&rsquo;s improvement in competitiveness in recent years has led IBM Global location trends to rate Ireland first in the world for inward investment by quality and value and first in Europe and second globally for the number of investment jobs per capita.</p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s recent exit from the bailout and the decision by Moody&rsquo;s to raise the rating on Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign debt to investment grade will have a very positive impact on the on the Irish economy. Investment agency ratings are used by foreign investors when they are deciding where to locate their businesses.  I am confident that the continued work of Government in restoring the economy and the publication of the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs will lead to the attraction of further foreign direct investment into the country and the creation of additional much needed jobs.</p><p>  To respond to the significant job losses in manufacturing in the years up to 2010, and to build on the potential for this sector, I asked Forf&aacute;s to undertake an analysis of Manufacturing in Ireland and the resultant Strategy, which I launched in April last, sets a comprehensive suite of recommendations to develop the sector, and these actions are now being progressed (including through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>  ).  The Strategy identifies that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in Manufacturing by 2016.  The tide is already turning, as in the years 2011 and 2012 there was a net increase of 3,700 jobs in the Manufacturing sector. This trend has gained momentum with the latest Central Statistics figures (QNHS-Q3 2013) showing that almost a further 8,000 jobs have been created in the period since the Strategy was published.  There are now 213,600 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland and a similar number of people employed indirectly: the total supported within the sector is therefore about 427,000.  A particularly attractive feature of manufacturing in Ireland is the fact that many of the present jobs are not in the main urban areas, but dispersed into regional locations, thereby providing a valuable employment focus in areas where alternative jobs are scarce. </p></reply>

There are now 213,600 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland and when account is taken of indirect jobs supported, it now supports over 427,000 people.  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned and which was published last year, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report was also published in relation to skills needs by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.  This will enable the Government to identify key areas and actions that will assist in increasing growth in the sector.</p><p>  Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and 2013</i>  .  The Manufacturing Development Forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations which include delivering a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms, redressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.</p><p>  We must maintain and exploit our natural advantages and, in doing so, continue to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and develop our indigenous manufacturing sector, particularly in higher-value sub sectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, amongst others.  </p><p>In relation to the services sector, this accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland.  While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency-supported companies, the job creation trend has been very positive.  According to the latest figures available, the total net new full-time jobs created in the agency-supported service industry for 2012 was 6,372.  This is very positive growth.  The <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2013</i>   outlined a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services. </p><p>  In relation the indigenous sector, in its recent End-of-Year Statement, Enterprise Ireland announced that its client companies created 18,033 new jobs in 2013 &ndash; a net increase of 5,442 jobs.  These companies now directly and indirectly account for more than 300,000 jobs in the Irish economy equating to 16% of the total workforce.</p><p>  The challenge for Government is to continue to support companies to build on this success and continue to grow employment in 2014.  With this in mind, my officials are currently coordinating the completion of the <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014</i>.  The Action Plan will outline ambitious job targets for the enterprise development agencies and a suite of other measures to support job creation.</p></reply>

The European Research Framework Programme -  which is the largest innovation and technology programme offering grant assistance from the EU  -  has always been an important element in providing international linkages and enhancing the excellence of the Irish R&amp;D system.  The EU Framework Programme has enabled academic and industry research groups to work with their peers across Europe and beyond, and to derive the benefits associated with collaborative research, such as access to knowledge networks, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.  </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the recently concluded Seventh Framework Programme 2007-2013 (FP7) , has been very successful.  We are on track to reach our target of drawing down &euro;600 million from FP7. According to the latest available figures (July, 2013), Ireland&rsquo;s total drawdown in FP7 currently stands at &euro;572 million with funding to private industry at &euro;149 million, or 26% of all funding received to date.  It is not possible to provide specific figures regarding support for the manufacturing and services sectors. While the funding to industry includes support for these sectors, some of the funding to higher education institutions also supports future innovation and job creation in these sectors.</p><p>  Horizon 2020, the successor to FP7, offers huge opportunities to researchers, research organisations and industry to engage in cutting edge research, and power Europe towards economic recovery.  With a budget of almost &euro;80 billion, and covering the next seven years, Horizon 2020 is the biggest ever European Research and Innovation Programme and the largest worldwide.  Many of our research organisations and third level colleges have developed specific strategies to improve their level of performance in Horizon 2020 and are now better prepared for participating in EU research programmes than ever before.  </p><p>  The Government has set an ambitious but achievable target for Irish researchers, of winning funding of &euro;1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.  We have proved that we have an excellent science base on which to compete successfully with the best. A comprehensive national strategy is being implemented which will direct our engagement in Horizon 2020 and ensure that we maximize the benefits for Ireland.  </p></reply>

Ireland has moved up to 17<sup>th</sup> place in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook 2013 having being ranked 24<sup>th</sup> only 2 years ago, while Ireland is ranked 15<sup>th</sup> in the World Bank&rsquo;s Doing Business 2014 Report and was recently named by Forbes magazine as the &ldquo;Best Country for Business&rdquo;.</p><p>  There are a number of key areas where Ireland tops the various global competitiveness rankings, including in relation to: business impact of rules on foreign direct investment; inflation; FDI and technology transfer; availability of skilled labour; flexibility and adaptability of the labour force; and investment incentives.</p><p>  While Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved in recent years, we must continue to do more, to ensure that these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover and that we continue to address the structural imbalances which had built up over the lifetime of the previous Government.  Through the Action Plans for Jobs in 2012 and 2013, the Government has focussed on measures aimed at restoring our competitiveness position and creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland.  The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government&rsquo;s exit from the Troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  I am currently finalising the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, which will build on the progress made in recent years and will include further measures aimed at improving our competitiveness performance.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s overarching aim is to accelerate both the economic and societal return on our public investment in STI.  In this context, implementation of Research Prioritisation, underway since March 2012, will see the majority of public research funding aligned with 14 priority areas where we are most likely to get economic and societal returns, particularly in the form of jobs.  Action Plans have been drawn up and approved by Government for each of the 14 Priority Areas and monitoring systems have been developed and approved by Government to measure the outputs and impact of funding provided.</p><p>  Another key initiative is the adoption of the Intellectual Property Protocol, which outlines a clear, robust and industry friendly policy for the commercialisation of IP arising from state funded research.  As result of this, the central Technology Transfer Office (cTTO) is being established.  The aim of the cTTO is to encourage the commercialisation of IP arising from State funded research, with a view to achieving more job creation from our investment in this area.</p><p>  Furthermore, the remit of Science Foundation Ireland has been expanded to cover applied research, aligned with the 14 priority areas to further support the development of research findings into commercial opportunities, further enhancing our job creation potential. In 2013 SFI had links to 41% (2,618) of 6,449 jobs (90 company announcements) announced by the IDA in all fields.</p><p>  It was most encouraging to see that the European Commission&rsquo;s Innovation Union Scoreboard, published in spring 2013, shows Ireland retaining its position among those EU Member States with above average performance in their research and innovation systems.  Moreover, the European Commission &lsquo;Indicator of Innovation Output&rsquo;, announced in September 2013, shows Ireland, along with Sweden, Germany and Luxembourg as EU Member States getting the most out of innovation.</p></reply>

There are now 213,600 people directly employed in the sector in Ireland and when account is taken of indirect jobs supported, it now supports over 427,000 people.  The Forf&aacute;s Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned and which was published last year, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report was also published in relation to skills needs by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s.</p><p>  Arising from the Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by my Department and relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>.  The Manufacturing Development Forum, comprising industry practitioners, is helping to address the key issues arising from the Strategy recommendations.  These include delivering a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms, redressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.  We must maintain and exploit our natural advantages and, in doing so, continue to attract foreign direct investment and develop our indigenous manufacturing sector, particularly in higher-value sub sectors, for example chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, amongst others.</p><p>  In relation to the Services sector, this accounts for two thirds of total employment within Ireland.  While the majority of service firms are not supported by the State, in respect of agency supported companies, the job creation trend is very positive.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 outlined a range of sectoral initiatives to facilitate new and established services companies to grow, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.  In addition, the recently published Medium Term Economic Strategy (MTES) has identified the Services Sector as a key driver of job creation and growth.  The MTES highlights the opportunities in a range of sectors and it is envisaged that the forthcoming <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2014</i> will concentrate to a significant extent on a range of actions to develop various aspects of the Services Sector.</p><p>  In relation to jobs created in County Kildare in the manufacturing and services sectors over the last three years, such data is not readily available.  However, non sector- specific details of jobs created and lost by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the County Enterprise Board, in each individual county, over recent years, were supplied by me in the reply to Parliamentary Question 47719/13 dated 12<sup>th</sup> November 2013, and this additional information can be forwarded by my Departmental officials if required.</p></reply>

However, the Department of Social Protection has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.</p><p>  Under the SWA scheme, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  This is to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment.  Examples of the main types of needs that may be met under this provision in respect of severe weather conditions includes assistance towards the purchase of household appliances, bedding, clothing and household repair and maintenance.</p><p>  In addition to the payment of ENPs, SWA legislation also provides for assistance in the form of an urgent needs payment (UNP) which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA.  The person may be required to pay the money back in respect of a UNP at a later date, for example, if the person had significant capital or income or was later compensated by an insurance company.</p><p>  In response to the recent weather events the humanitarian assistance scheme has been activated.  The humanitarian assistance scheme, which is means-tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and, in some instances, structural repairs as a result of the flooding damage.  The Government has not set a limit on the amount that can be paid to an individual household under this scheme.  Levels of payment depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses.  Any person continuing to experience hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering the SWA scheme who may be able to offer assistance.</p></reply>

When a DB scheme is set up, the level of employer and employee contributions is agreed and established in contract in the Trust Deeds and Rules of each scheme.  The Trust Deeds and Rules differ from scheme to scheme and reflect the level of obligation of the parties involved.  </p><p>  Significant challenges exist for many DB schemes and many employers, trustees and scheme members are making great efforts to ensure their ongoing viability.  This process is generally managed through dialogue between the parties, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.  This may include a mix of measures such as increased employer/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.  </p><p>  In developing the legislative changes contained in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013, very significant efforts were made to identify an approach that strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of pensioners, active and deferred members across the broad range of scheme portfolios and scheme structures.  To ensure the broadest range of views and expertise was considered, the consultation process included a stakeholder consultation.  This included groups representing older people and pensioners, the pensions industry, employers and trade unions.  Written submissions were also sought from the groups and informed the review process.  In addition, the Department engaged external technical and actuarial specialists to undertake modelling exercises which assisted in the review process.</p><p>  Before the recent changes were introduced, when a DB scheme wound up and was underfunded, pensioners received 100% priority for their benefits, often at the expense of current and former employees.  The legislative changes aim to provide for a fairer and more equitable distribution of scheme assets whilst also facilitating greater sharing of the risk between all the beneficiaries when a scheme is underfunded.  However, a principle underlying the changes was that pensioners would continue to be afforded the highest level of protection, particularly those on low to moderate pensions with protection levels set at 100% of pensions up to &euro;12,000; 90% of pensions between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000; and 80% of pensions greater than &euro;60,000.  </p><p>  Pension schemes generally make an allowance for the State pension when calculating final pensionable salary for the occupational pension.  This is often referred to as a &quot;co-ordinated&quot; or &quot;integrated pension&quot;.  In the case of a co-ordinated pension, the recent changes to the Pensions Act will not apply to the State element of a co-ordinated pension.  Those on an un-co-ordinated defined benefit pensions typically include pre-1995 employees in the civil and public service and commercial semi-state organisations.  The pensions of these individuals are generally higher than those who have an entitlement to the State pension.  This is apparent in an analysis of pensions in payment which shows that the median pension for pensioners of commercial semi-state organisations is &euro;21,500 compared to &euro;11,000 for pensioners in the private sector. </p><p>  Any consideration by the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits under the Pensions Act is not an arbitrary task.  The trustees of pension schemes have a fiduciary duty under Trust Law and the Pensions Act to act in the best interest of all scheme members.  The Pensions Act and statutory guidance issued by the Pensions Board sets down detailed criteria which the trustees of a scheme must comply with before application to the Pensions Board to issue a direction to restructure pension scheme benefits.</p><p>  In relation to the pension fund levy, this is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  This levy, which was introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative in 2011, will be abolished from the 31st of December 2014.  An additional levy on pension funds at 0.15%, to continue to help fund the Jobs Initiative and current and future State liabilities in relation to pensions, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015. </p><p>  In the case of both a company and the scheme being insolvent, the State will guarantee that existing pension benefits will be protected to a level of 50%, with pensions of &euro;12,000 or less being 100% protected.  In this context, I must emphasise that the Pensions Board is working with pension schemes, particularly schemes in a poorly funded position to help these schemes achieve a more sustainable funding position thereby decreasing the likelihood of State intervention.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the Act provides that a foreign divorce is recognised if granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled at the date of the institution of the proceedings for divorce.</p><p>  The Registrar General is the statutory officer responsible for the system of marriage registration in the State.  I have made inquiries of the Registrar General and I understand that persons intending to marry in the State must give three months&rsquo; notice of intention to marry and provide the registrar with evidence as to forename, surname, address, marital status, age and nationality. If a party to an intended marriage is divorced that person is required to provide a court certified copy of the final divorce decree.  If the divorce was granted in a non-EU foreign jurisdiction they must provide evidence that the rules regarding the recognition of foreign divorces set out in the 1986 Act are satisfied, that is, that one of the parties to the divorce had a domicile in that jurisdiction at the relevant time.  Where one of the parties to the divorce had a domicile of origin in the jurisdiction which granted the divorce, evidence of domicile is normally satisfied by the production of a birth certificate and a statement by way of affidavit that the person in question continues to reside in that jurisdiction.  If the person left their domicile of origin and moved to another jurisdiction they may acquire a domicile of choice.  The acquisition of a domicile of choice can be difficult to prove and each case is examined on its own merits. </p><p>  I understand from the Registrar General that the position in relation to divorces granted in China is that once they are granted by a court they are potentially recognisable in the State, providing the rules relating to domicile can be satisfied and that a Chinese divorce involving mediation as part of a court process is similarly potentially recognisable.</p></reply>

A significant reform programme to ensure appropriate resources are focused in the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance for unemployed persons is well advanced.  The rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities &ndash; payment processing, control and activation - has resulted in changes in the way CWS services are delivered and the rationalisation of some Community Welfare Service clinics.</p><p>  In Co. Kildare, in preparation for these changes, the Department contacted all affected customers directly, advising them of the changes in the services.  The Community Welfare Service in Athy which was formerly available two mornings per week at a walk-in clinic is now available Monday to Friday through initial telephone contact, which means the service can be delivered without the need to attend a clinic.  Telephone calls are followed by appointments if necessary, home visit or application by post for non-urgent claims. </p><p>  All calls are returned within one working day and emergency calls are prioritised.  Where any customers are not able by reason of illness or disability to attend an appointment arrangements will be made to see them in their home.  A fast referral service has now also been put in place with a standard Referral Form issued to local organisations and representatives. </p><p>  Prior to the restructuring, several changes to the operation of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (SWA) in South Kildare/West Wicklow had already been made.  All claims for Rent Supplement were centralised to a dedicated unit.  All claims for Mortgage Interest Supplement were centralised to one office within the area.  A system of Integrated Decisions was put in place in Newbridge Local Office in order to expedite claims for Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit and One Parent Family payment and thus minimise the recourse to SWA in these cases. </p><p>  The result of these initiatives has been to greatly reduce the dependence on SWA, and the local Community Welfare Service, in local areas.  The main business now transacted locally is applications for Exceptional Needs Payments.</p><p>  All changes will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure adequate services continue to be available. </p><p>  Contact details for the Athy service are as follows:<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Telephone</th></tr><tr><td>Athy - Castledermot</td><td>045 - 887831</td></tr><tr><td>Dunlavin &ndash; Ballitore &ndash; Baltinglass </td><td>045 - 887829</td></tr><tr><td>Rent Supplement Claims</td><td>1890 - 800698</td></tr><tr><td>Mortgage Interest Supplement claims</td><td>045 - 887833</td></tr><tr><td>Fax Number for Referrals</td><td>045 - 887845</td></tr><tr><td>Postal Address for all Referrals</td><td>P.O.

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (trading as &quot;3&quot;), the NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  My Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  Throughout the contract period, network utilisation and performance data is submitted by &quot;3&quot; to my Department on a monthly basis.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on &quot;3&quot;, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to  or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  My Department will then liaise with &quot;3&quot; personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues. </p><p>  The NBS customer referred to in the Question has not been in contact with my officials.  However, I understand from &quot;3&quot; that the customer contacted its customer care centre regarding service performance issues earlier this month.  &quot;3&quot; have informed my officials that, following a review of the customer's service, arrangements are being made for a site visit by its engineering staff to his premises to conduct an investigation into the reported issues.  My Department liaises very closely with &quot;3&quot; to ensure that any issues relating to service performance, which are brought to its attention, are addressed as quickly as possible.  While my Department has previously dealt with a small number of individual complaints from NBS customers in County Kerry, there is no evidence to suggest widespread poor quality performance in the area.</p></reply>

Increasing Ireland's levels of renewable energy and energy efficiency is critical for reducing our heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels and thereby improving the sustainability of our energy supply.  Ireland's target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources, as mandated under the Renewables Directive (2009/28/EC), is a significant contribution in the context of the current Energy and Climate Framework objectives.</p><p>  The period between 2020 and 2030 is the next critical phase in the evolution of both EU climate and energy policy and the European Commission has just published on 22 January 2014, a Communication setting out its ambition for a 2030 Energy and Climate Framework.  As Minister with responsibility for energy policy, I welcome the inclusion of a target for renewables, which I, along with Ministers from seven other Member States specifically called for this.  I look forward to examining the Commission's proposals for 2030 in more detail and to working closely with all relevant Departments on this important cross cutting issue to ensure a fully coordinated approach is taken.  Not only is the renewable energy sector of key importance for how emissions targets in the context of Climate Change policy are met, it also provides a real, and sustainable, economic opportunity for Ireland, both in terms of a secure, indigenous, source of energy and as a clean energy export.</p><p>  Regarding 2050 policy, I published a scoping report in November 2013 on a low carbon roadmap for the electricity generation sector that will feed into the national roadmap envisaged under the Government's forthcoming Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.  The public consultation on this scoping report has just concluded. A total of fourteen responses were received and I intend to publish these on my Department's website shortly.  In addition, I intend to publish the third iteration of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) later this year.  Reducing energy consumption through efficiency remains the most cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gases and one of the primary means of achieving Ireland's climate change objectives.  My Department intends to publish an energy policy green paper later this year which will involve a full public consultation process.</p><p>  The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) operates a number of programmes and projects which aim to provide data or planning toolkits to support policy and interventions by a range of public bodies and agencies in relation to climate change mitigation.  The INFOMAR seabed mapping programme is a joint venture between the GSI and the Marine Institute.  The near shore mapping acquired has contributed to improved coastal flood modelling taking into account the effects of climate change including sea level rise.  Work is also under way in conjunction with the British Geological Survey to complete a feasibility study on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the Irish Sea basins.  CCS technologies may assist in reducing Irish CO2 emissions in the medium term.  GSI is also conducting a shallow geothermal project, providing best practice guidelines with a view to supporting industry and homeowners in this emerging renewable energy sector.</p></reply>

The establishment of Irish Water is an integral component of this strategy and involves major organisational change, an entirely new funding structure governed by economic regulation, the introduction of domestic water charges based on usage and the roll-out of a national domestic metering programme. </p><p>  The role of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) was key to bringing the necessary skills and competencies to the project, allowing the utility to be established within an ambitious timeline at lower cost and at least risk, by leveraging from their knowledge, systems and skills and matching this with skills within the water sector.  BGE had initial responsibility for certain key deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy, pending the enactment of the Water Services Acts, which, <i>inter alia, </i>provided for BGE to establish Irish Water as a subsidiary company. </p><p>  My Department continues to engage with officials of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government and with BGE on matters which are relevant to the overarching corporate governance responsibility for BGE and my role as shareholder of BGE.  The Water Services Acts 2013, together with Irish Water's Memorandum and Articles of Association, provide the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with a consenting role for certain matters relating to Irish Water.  In this regard I have consented to approvals granted by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government on key matters including Irish Water borrowings from the NPRF (National Pensions Reserve Fund) and capital expenditure on the water metering project.</p><p>  My Department does not have a role in assessing the establishment costs for Irish Water, which I understand are subject to examination by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  The key focus of my Department, working with the NewERA shareholder executive unit of the NTMA and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been to ensure that BGE is well positioned to play its critical role in maintaining the security of Irish energy supplies, while also facilitating delivery of important Programme for Government commitments including the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the establishment of Irish Water.</p></reply>

The remaining &euro;51m is in the form of annuity loans with the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), for which local authorities are making repayments to the HFA and recoup ing   these payments from my Department.</p><p>  In 2013 as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on LAGS, in terms of accepting new applications into the scheme, was no longer a sustainable option. The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35/2013 on 11 December, 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications.</p><p>  Prior to the discontinuation of the Scheme, three loans were submitted by Sligo County Council for sites at Ballintogher, Lisnalurg and Tubbercurry for incl usion in the Scheme; all of these   were fully assessed and accepted into the scheme and have since been fully redeemed. No other Sligo County Council applications were under consideration at the point of the Scheme&rsquo;s discontinuance.</p><p>  Two applications for inclusion into the Scheme from Sligo Borough Council in respect of sites at   Finisklin and Robbers Lane Magherboy were, however, still under consideration when Circular 35/2013 was issued and these and other applications which were under consideration and not yet finalised no longer qualify for acceptance. </p><p>  An application was also received from Sligo Borough Council to have loans for a site at Ballinode included in the Scheme. These loans were approved under Circular 24/2012 for inclusion in the revised Scheme. A condition of the recoupment process provides that only when the land has been transferred to Housing Sustainable Communities Ltd. (HSC Ltd.) can the housing authority apply to have the annuity payment recouped. To date the lands at Ballinode have not been transferred and Sligo Borough Council has been advised of the relevant requirements in respect of land transfer and the recoupment process.</p><p>  The Department continues to engage with the Housing Finance Agency and the local government sector in relation to the management of the local authority loan book generally . Local authorities are advised to consult with the Housing Finance Agency directly on the management of loans relating to lands not accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.</p></reply>

The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012. </p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. </p><p>  In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. </p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by the Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure has been provided to Irish Water in 2013. My consent was given with the consent of the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF. My Department is awaiting a report on the actual drawdown of the loan during 2013. Reports to date indicate that almost &euro;100m was spent in 2013 on establishment costs and some &euro;35m has been spent on the initial stages of the metering programme. </p><p>  The company also indicated that to date, as part of the establishment of the company, some &euro;50m has been spent on external service providers. The procurement by Irish Water of external resources was a matter for the company and I had no role in approving individual contracts. However, the company indicated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last week that the following major companies were used by the Irish Water Programme to help deliver the required systems and processes in the establishment of Irish Water - IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG. Further details of the contracts relating to the establishment of Irish Water are set out in the submission made by the company to the Joint Oireachtas Committee and this submission has been published on the company&rsquo;s website at </p><p>  As the establishment costs were to be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water, they would also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. Against this background, and in advance of the establishment of Irish Water, my Department provided confirmation to BGE that spending being properly incurred on the water services activities would be recoverable in the event that the project was not proceeded with or, subject to meeting certain conditions, be recoverable as part of the funding model to be reviewed by the Commission. This initial commitment was provided by my Department in December 2012 and updated on a number of occasions in advance of the incorporation of Irish Water and the consent to the NPRF lending. The consent for Irish Water to enter into the loan arrangement with the NPRF was provided in July 2013, with an understanding of the overall estimated budget involved. It is also the Department&rsquo;s expectation that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water. </p><p>  The Water Services Act 2013 requires Irish Water to submit separate accounts to me not later than six months from the end of the financial year with a view to the laying of such accounts before each House of the Oireachtas. In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and almost &euro;490m from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from borrowing and this will be the subject of appropriate Ministerial consents in due course. My Department has requested a detailed cash flow projection in this regard for 2014 from Irish Water, which would include projected annual establishment and metering costs. We are also awaiting updated budget information on operational costs. Irish Water has agreed operational budgets with local authorities for the component of costs which they will meet during 2014. </p><p>  Irish Water is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects previously included in my Department&rsquo;s 2010 - 2013 Water Services Investment Programme. On the basis of the proposed State equity provision and borrowing, this programme is likely to give rise to spending of some &euro;310m in 2014.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through Service Level Agreements.  The majority of the existing staff remain employees of local authorities working under such arrangements from 1 January 2014. As such, no staff transferred from local authorities or from other public sector positions to Irish Water.</p><p>  Any employees of Irish Water who came from the local authority sector or from the public service sector immediately prior to taking up a post with Irish Water applied for advertised posts and were recruited through a competitive process.</p><p>  Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the internal capabilities required within the organisation and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for the organisation. It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance. Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water&rsquo;s website <i>. </i></p><p>  Data supplied by Irish Water indicate that at present 310 staff appointments have been made in Irish Water. The breakdown of these staff in terms of their employment immediately before recruitment is as follows: 59 were recruited from Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann; 107 from Local Authorities; 5 from my Department and the balance, 139, were externally recruited. </p><p>  I and my Department will not necessarily have access to details of expenditure and other organisational matters in relation to Irish Water. In this context, and to support and assist public representatives in their role, my Department has requested Irish Water, on behalf of myself and Minister O&rsquo;Dowd, to take early action to ensure that public representatives are regularly briefed on matters pertaining to the organisation and operation of the utility. Irish Water is currently considering how best to support and respond to the Parliamentary and public representation needs of elected representatives at national and local level. </p><p>  Pending the establishment of these arrangements, my Department requested the information sought in the questions from Irish Water in relation to salaries and I can indicate that the salaries of the 310 employees of Irish Water can be broken down as follows: <table><tr><th>Salary </th><th>Staff </th></tr><tr><td>Less than &euro;70,000 </td><td>183 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;70,000 - &euro;79,999 </td><td>42 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;80,000 - &euro;89,999 </td><td>35 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;90,000 - &euro;99,999 </td><td>21 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;100,000 - &euro;124,999 </td><td>19 </td></tr><tr><td>&euro;125,000 - &euro;149,999 </td><td>9 </td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;150,000 </td><td>1 </td></tr><tr><td> -</td><td>310 </td></tr></table></p><p>  The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that these are in line with the arrangements applying with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. Bord G&aacute;is has in place a competitive market based pay model. The model offers market based pay ranges for all employees which includes a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA). A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group.  As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. </p><p>  In this model, where an employee does not meet expectations they will not be eligible for a performance award and underperformance will be dealt with under the Irish Water Disciplinary Procedure and will lead to sanctions up to and including dismissal. Performance pay will be based on a structured performance review and requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met. </p><p>  I also understand that no bonuses have been paid to Irish Water staff, but I have asked the company to set out the basis and content of the model as applied to Irish Water contracts of employment, including the criteria against which high performance will be evaluated and the kinds of targets (at company and division or grade levels) against which such performance may be bench-marked.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.427" nospeaker="true" ><p>To date Irish Water has provided my Department with the following information in relation to the arrangements on the performance related award, which is applied across Irish Water as follows and does not apply to the Managing Director of Irish Water: Staff Numbers Maximum % of Performance Related Award 

included in contract  

 50 2.75% 165 6.5% 65 14% 29 15% 309  

  The amount of the performance pay will be a function of corporate performance, business unit performance and individual performance. The figures outlined above illustrate the percentage to be allocated if an individual receives a 'Fully Meets Expectations&rsquo; performance rating. When an individual receives a &ldquo;Does Not Meet Expectations&rdquo; performance rating, no award will be made.</p></speech>

In line with the Code of Practice for the corporate governance of State bodies, the determination of the remuneration of the senior management of commercial State bodies, with the exception of the Chief Executive, is a matter for the Board of the body and not one in which I have a statutory remit. </p><p>  The Managing Director of Irish Water was appointed by the Board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, and his remuneration package was approved by me, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The gross salary payable to the Managing Director of Irish Water is &euro;200,000 per annum. In accordance with his approved Contract of Employment, the Managing Director of Irish Water is afforded the use of a company car (Honda CRV) on terms determined by the Company. </p><p>  I and my Department will not necessarily have access to details of expenditure and other organisational matters in relation to the company. In this context, and to support and assist public representatives in their role, my Department has requested Irish Water, on behalf of myself and Minister O&rsquo;Dowd, to take early action to ensure that public representatives are regularly briefed on matters pertaining to the organisation and operation of the utility. Irish Water is currently considering how best to support and respond to the Parliamentary and public representation needs of elected representatives at national and local level. </p><p>  Pending the establishment of these arrangements, my Department requested the information sought in the questions from Irish Water and I can indicate that nine regional managers working on the domestic metering programme have been provided with leased cars on the basis that they are on-call and may be required to travel twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. The cars are 1.6 diesel engines and the models are: one Kia Optima, one Kia Sportage, two VW Passat, and five Ford Mondeos.   </p><p>  A car allowance of &euro;10,500 is paid to twenty seven Senior Managers who are required to use their own cars in the course of their duties with Irish Water. This is a fully taxable non-pensionable allowance, subject to tax, PRSI and USC. This is in lieu of the payment of mileage expenses as would pertain in other circumstances, as the company views this as a more cost-effective option. </p><p>  Irish Water has confirmed that while no member of staff has a debit or charge card, two credit cards have been issued for business use in Irish Water. These cards are for company purchases or costs on behalf of the business. The cards have been issued in the name of the Managing Director and the Head of Customer Operations. In 2013 approximately &euro;10,000 was spent on each card. The only commitment to date in 2014 relates to an amount of &euro;375. Irish Water is preparing a breakdown of the various payments, which they will directly issue to the Deputy.   </p><p>  The holder of the card does not approve the payment of the credit card bill, in other words, there is a further sign-off as part of the approvals process. All charges to the credit card must be accompanied by supporting documentation </p><p>  Irish Water provides health insurance of VHI Plan C or equivalent for nine of its Senior Executives, no other staff benefits are in place.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance. </p><p>  The Act provided for a three month transition period from 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2013 to allow vehicle owners to bring their motor tax status up to date by making either or both a retrospective and prospective off-road declaration, as appropriate. </p><p>  The new arrangements have been fully in force since 1 October 2013.  These only allow for a future declaration which must be made in the month before tax falls due.  The declaration of non-use can be made at any time during that month, either via the local motor tax office or online, and is free of charge. The declaration cannot be made along with a payment of arrears which is payable only once a full month has elapsed i.e. where a vehicle has been without tax for a full calendar month.  The minimum period for which a vehicle licence can be taken out is three months. </p><p>  As the Non-Use of Motor Vehicles Act 2013 made minimal other changes to the existing taxation system, no changes were made to the duration of vehicle licences, which can be taken out for three, six or twelve months, or to the payment of arrears which are required to be paid in conjunction with the taking out of a vehicle licence, where there is a gap of more than a month between the expiry of the last vehicle licence and the renewal of the next licence.   </p><p>  There was extensive public notice of the Act&rsquo;s coming into force and widespread awareness-raising of the new arrangements from before the start of the transition period.  The measures are aimed at closing an evasion loophole, costing taxpayers approximately &euro;55m per annum, which was facilitated through the use of retrospective declarations.  They are also intended to ensure that motorists keep their vehicle status up to date, that is, the vehicle should be either taxed or the subject of a declaration of non-use.  This is important both from an enforcement aspect as well as ensuring a consistent flow of income to the Local Government Fund.</p></reply>

I fully agree with the Commissioner's analysis in this matter. It is important to remember that while the Garda station in question has reduced opening hours to the public, it remains as a functioning Garda station on a 24 hour basis.  The result of these reduced public opening hours is that Garda&iacute; have been freed from public counter duties in these stations at night and are now available for operational policing.</p><p>  The Commissioner has no plans to change these current opening hours.</p></reply>

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions but the decision is solely at the discretion of the Judge who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</p><p>  The Courts Service has indicated that where an organisation wishes to become a beneficiary from the Court Poor Box they may apply, in writing, to their local District Court Office and any applications received will be brought to the attention of the presiding judge. In Dublin, applications should be forwarded to the President of the District Court.</p><p>  Work is at a very advanced stage in my Department on the General Scheme of a Bill to replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions, such as probation orders, and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  The Court Poor Box is being examined in this context with a view to bringing forward proposals for a transparent statutory reparation scheme.  I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the near future.</p></reply>

I intend to have these staff in place by the end of February to enable the new Authority to carry out the necessary preparatory work before coming formally into operation later this year.</p><p>  An early priority for the new Authority will be the preparation and publication of a statutory register of charities. All registered charities will be required to provide reports to the Authority each year on their activities and these reports will be made available to the public. This will provide a much needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charitable sector, and will support the good practice in charity governance and management that is critical to a vibrant charity sector that commands the trust and confidence of donors and beneficiaries alike.</p></reply>

I signed the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 (Sections 3 to 12) Commencement Order 2014 on 10 January, commencing Part 2 of the Act on 11 January.</p><p>  The changes to the <i>in camera</i> rule retain the privacy provisions in respect of family law and child care court proceedings but allow for <i>bona fide </i>  representatives of the press to attend such proceedings subject to strict conditions.  The courts retain the power to exclude representatives of the press and to restrict or prohibit the publication of evidence given in the proceedings in certain circumstances.  In addition, a strict prohibition applies on reporting of material likely to identify the parties to the proceedings or any children to whom the proceedings relate.  </p><p>  I believe that it is in the public interest that there be greater knowledge of the administration of the law in this important area and, in this context, that the media have access to, and be able to report on, family law and child care cases.  These reforms will provide valuable information to the public, judiciary and legal professionals on the operation of the law by our courts.  While the new provisions have been in place for less than two weeks, the impact of the changes is already very evident from extensive media reporting, even in that short period, of cases which would up to now have gone unreported.</p></reply>

One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  The EAG&rsquo;s report was accepted by Government in 1995.      </p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA). In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct. Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service;</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years;</p><p>  - Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks. A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. As discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time, other than to emphasise that in dealing with this issue the manpower and operational needs of the Defence Forces must be the primary consideration.</p><p>  It is intended to finalise negotiations with the Representative Association as soon as possible in 2014.</p></reply>

Acceptance into the scheme was established using the pre-determined selection criteria as follows:</p><p>  1.farmers in the Boora region of Co. Offaly who chose Wild Bird Cover Option B (Grey Partridge) as one of their selected options, </p><p>  2.farmers with a minimum of 0.5 hectares of designated land,</p><p>  3.farm partnerships, </p><p>  4.farmers who previously participated in REPS commencing with smallest farms. and</p><p>  5.others based on farm size (again favouring smaller holdings).</p><p>  Based on the funding available farmers in category 4 with 22.06 hectares of utilisable agricultural area and below were successful. Category 4 farmers with areas greater than this and all farmers in category 5 were unsuccessful.  On the basis of his application form, the person named came under category 5 as he had not previously participated in REPS. On this basis a letter issued to him informing him that he was unsuccessful and setting out the reasons.</p><p>  An appeal was received stating that the applicant had Natura (callows) land which was omitted from both the 2012 SPS application and from the AEOS application. If an applicant had Natura land they would have qualified for the Scheme under selection criteria 2 i.e. farmers with a minimum of 0.5 ha of designated land.

My Department has initiated work on the preparation of the agriculture sectoral roadmap and facilitated an eight week public consultation that ran from September to November 2013. My Department understands that there will be further public consultation on the draft National Low Carbon Roadmap in due course.</p><p>  It is planned that the first agriculture sectoral roadmap will examine and outline coherent and cost-effective measures that will seek to achieve sectoral emissions reduction initially in the period to 2020, while being mindful of the very real global food security imperative.</p><p>  The sectoral roadmap will also examine how the agriculture sector can adapt to the effects of climate change. It is likely that, in Ireland&rsquo;s case, climate change will bring both opportunities and threats that must be considered by all actors involved.</p><p>As well as benefitting from public consultation, my Department is also working with colleagues in Teagasc who have carried out very relevant research in relation to cost-effective agricultural mitigation measures. These include the <i>Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture </i>(September 2012) and the more recent study &lsquo;<i>Carbon-Neutrality as a horizon point for Irish Agriculture&rsquo; </i>  (December 2013) which aims to address and provide a scientific framework for the challenge posed in seeking an approach to carbon-neutrality in the longer term for agriculture.</p><p>  My Department will continue to work closely with other Departments and agencies in developing the technical capacity necessary to underpin evolution of national climate policy and the development of a definition for carbon neutrality in the agricultural sector.</p><p>  In early 2012 my Department procured the services of a team of independent consultants to carry out an environmental analysis of various scenarios by which the targets in Food Harvest 2020 might be achieved. At the outset of the analysis, my Department facilitated an eight week period of public consultation which ran from May to July 2012. All submissions received were forwarded to the consultants for consideration. When the draft final report was ready, a further eight week period of public consultation was facilitated on the draft, and this ran from September to November 2013. Again all submissions were forwarded to the consultants for consideration before finalising their report. In addition to the two periods of public consultation, officials of my Department met with representatives of Environmental Pillar on five occasions to discuss the progress of the analysis, which includes recommendations on mitigation. The consultants were present at three of these meetings. It is expected that the final report of this analysis will be available very shortly.</p></reply>

While improved farm efficiencies and productivity are essential to producer profitability, price is a major contributor in increasing returns to beef farmers. Cattle prices have reached historically high levels in recent years because of supply shortages in the domestic and export markets.</p><p>  However, because of the country&rsquo;s dependence on beef exports, cattle prices are largely determined by the industry&rsquo;s export performance. With the assistance of Bord Bia, the industry been very successful in positioning Irish beef in key European markets with almost 66% of export volumes now destined for the higher value standard retail, premium foodservice and retail or quick service sectors. Maintaining this export performance in a competitive environment requires a continuous focus on satisfying customer demands and adding value to our unique grass-fed beef product through improving its animal welfare, sustainability and carbon footprint credentials on the basis of Teagasc R&amp;amp;D activities.</p><p>  Neither I nor my Department can exert any control over the prices obtained by producers for their livestock but I have put in place a number of support measures to underpin the viability of primary production. These include the Beef Genomics Scheme (BGS) for which &euro;23 million has been set aside in this year&rsquo;s budget. The BGS which will begin the process of building a genetic database for the beef sector that will position Ireland as a global leader in beef genetics and ultimately lead to a more efficient and profitable farm sector. </p><p>  In addition to the BGS, &euro;9 million in funding will be disbursed under the Beef Data Programme (BDP) in 2014. The objectives of the BDP are to improve the genetic quality of the national beef herd through the collection of essential breeding and production information and to stimulate improvements in the competitiveness and output quality of the Irish beef industry. </p><p>  Apart from the BGS and the BDP, a further allocation of &euro;5 million has been earmarked for the continuation of the Beef Technology Adoption Programme (BTAP) in 2014. Some 6,200 farmers received an annual payment of &euro;825 in relation to their participation in the second year of the BTAP. In total, these supports, added to residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme, amount to an investment of almost &euro;40m in this strategically important sector in 2014.  </p><p>  With regard to the economics of beef production, the particular difficulties experienced by producers who market cattle over the winter period were considered by the industry-led Beef 2020 Activation Group, which was established to set out the actions necessary to achieve Food Harvest 2020 targets. The Group&rsquo;s report noted that a more widespread use of contracts would provide price certainty for winter finishers but acknowledged the problems faced by the processing industry in moving to a generalised contract system. </p><p>  The solution proposed by the Group is a winter finishing minimum price negotiated annually between the individual processor and the individual farmer for spring marketed animals taking account of over-wintering costs. This arrangement would aim to protect those farmers who bought-in or valued on-farm cattle at a price consistent with the actual beef price in the Autumn against serious loss. It would not protect those who overvalued their own stock or overpaid for bought-in cattle. Such an arrangement would assist producers and processors who wished to enter into mutually beneficial commitments based on market realities and would undoubtedly remove a substantial proportion of the farmer&rsquo;s financial exposure. These recommendations refer to the nature of the contractual agreements between farmers and producers and are of course a matter for industry.</p></reply>

School vision screening is one of a range of services carried out by the School Health Team, specifically by Public Health Nurses. As their salaries are not split and coded to specific activities, it is not possible to identify the cost of vision screening separately from other activities. For similar reasons it is not possible to track the cost of every visit by a child to an ophthalmologist. Referrals arising out of the vision screening service in primary schools would not be regarded as unnecessary. The HSE is currently considering various proposals for vision screening to make it as efficient and cost effective as possible.</p></reply>

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees.  This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation which is being drafted.  The Department and the HSE are currently considering the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the roll-out of GP services free to all children aged 5 and under.  Under the existing medical card and GP visit card contracts, it is always open to GPs to choose to participate or not and similar arrangements will apply under the new legislation.

I have reviewed the issues raised and I am satisfied that the current legislation is fair and reasonable and so there are no plans to amend it.  Section 4 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act (No.34 of l997), as amended, sets out the categories of persons who can make a claim before the Compensation Tribunal.  This Act was amended by the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act, 2006 (No.22 of 2006) where it is clearly defined that those who can make a claim must have been "diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C".  It is estimated that up to 16,000 women in Ireland were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D.  Approximately 1,000 of these women were infected with Hepatitis C and were therefore eligible to apply to the Tribunal for compensation.</p></reply>

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Currently, persons affected by Symphysiotomy or Thalidomide are automatically entitled to a medical card. Outside of these circumstances, all applications for a medical card are assessed on the basis of an applicant&rsquo;s means under the assessment guidelines.  There are no proposals for any amendments thereon.</p><p>  Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.

I note that Cystic Fibrosis Ireland has expressed its confidence that, following discussions, an agreement can be drawn up that will allow building to commence and I too am hopeful that this matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.  The key issue is that patients with CF are assured that sufficient beds will be available when they are needed, but at the same time, when beds are not needed for CF patients, they can be freed up for other very ill patients with respiratory and other conditions. </p><p>   In relation to the issue of infections raised by the Deputy, I have been assured by the HSE that CF patients will be accommodated in isolation rooms which will separate them from other patients on the ward.  In the event of a non CF patient occupying the isolation room, the room will be decontaminated before being occupied again.

These are set out in the HSE&rsquo;s 2014 Service Plan and include the phased implementation of Money Follows the Patient, the transition to Hospital Groups, implementation of new internal management processes, the establishment of an interim Patient Safety Agency, and the development of Commissioning Functions with the aim of achieving the greatest progress possible on a commissioner / provider split, prior to the introduction of statutory functions.

The preparation and publication of the HSE's annual Service Plan in each of the years 2011 to 2014 has taken place against a background of significantly reduced financial and human resources as a direct consequence of the very significant deterioration in the public finances that the State has had to contend with in this period. The resultant financial constraints has necessitated reductions in health service spending of over 20%. The numbers employed across the HSE have reduced by over 14,000 in this period.</p><p>  The HSE has, in each of the years from 2011 to date, continued to focus its efforts on minimising the impact on front line services by utilising new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reducing resources. The delivery of services has, as a consequence, focused on the dual challenge of protecting patient outcomes while, at the same time, reducing costs. This has required increasing emphasis on models of care that treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide safe quality services at the least possible cost.</p><p>  Despite these resource reductions the annual HSE Service Plan has managed, to a very significant extent, to maintain core service levels while also supporting growing demand for its services arising from population growth, increased levels of chronic disease, increased demand for drugs, higher numbers of medical card holders (up by 590,000 since 2008) and new cost intensive medical technologies and treatments. Additional funding has also been invested over this period to meet a range of critical service needs, and areas such as primary care and mental health services have benefitted from this funding. The roll out of such initiatives as the National Clinical Care Programmes and the Special Delivery Unit initiatives are also delivering greater value for money and productivity.</p><p>  In this regard, the 2013 edition of <i>Health at a Glance </i>published by the OECD shows that Ireland continues to make substantive headway in improving health outcomes. Mortality due to cancer fell by 21%, ischemic heart disease by 59% and cerebrovascular disease by 54% between 1990 and 2012 and in all three instances the rates of improvement in Ireland were above the OECD average. Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by a full four years since 2000 to reach 80.6 today, again above the OECD average. This has been achieved during a period when the average length of stay in acute hospitals has also reduced and the number of patients receiving treatment they require without having to stay in hospital (that is, day case patients) has increased as a percentage of total discharges by over 50%.</p><p>  The men and women who deliver our health and social care services are to be complemented for maintaining and, in many cases, improving the ever expanding range of services provided to the general public despite such reduced resources over the past four to five years. Their efforts have been highly commendable in these most challenging of times.</p></reply>

While this has fallen from a peak of 50.9% in 2008, Ireland continues to retain a high level of population holding voluntary private health insurance.<b></b>However, the figures underline the need for cost containment by insurers so that people can continue to afford health insurance.</p><p>  The Government is committed to keeping health insurance affordable for as many people as possible and I have consistently urged insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance. In this regard, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin to work with insurance companies and my Department on an independent review process to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  I am currently examining Phase 1 of Mr. McLoughlin's report, <i>Review of Measures to Reduce Costs in the Private Health Insurance Market 2013</i>, which was published on 26th December 2013. The second phase of Mr. McLoughlin&rsquo;s review has commenced and will report within three months.  In particular it will study further the drivers behind rising costs in the health insurance industry and seek to address them.</p><p>  As Minister, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to health insurance prices set by the health insurance providers. However, many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured. There are numerous lower cost plans available from all four health insurers and it is quite possible for consumers to find a similar level of cover in the market for a cheaper price. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA plays an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information, and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-01-23a.664.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014012300076#WRZ01600"><p>The State has introduced a series of reforms in recent years to reduce pharmaceutical prices and expenditure. These have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013; the average cost per items reimbursed is now running at 2001/2002 levels.</p><p>  In relation to the specific product Montelukast, the originator product Singulair came off patent in March 2013. Under the terms of the 2012 Agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE reduced the price of Singulair to 70% of its initial price in Quarter 2 2013 and will reduce it to 50% of the initial price in Quarter 2 2014. Under the terms of the 2012 Agreement with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), generic versions of Montelukast are currently priced at 50% of the originator initial price. In Quarter 2 of 2014, the price will be reduced to 47.5% of the initial originator price.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides that from June 2013 the maximum price of all new medicinal products reimbursed under the community drug schemes will be set in accordance with the criteria set out in the Act. The Act also provides that the HSE must review all items currently reimbursable under the GMS and other community drug schemes (including prices) within three years to determine if they should remain on the reimbursement list and, if so, what price should apply. In addition, the Act introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that reference pricing will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.</p><p>  Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicinal products. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 groups of medicinal products, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.  They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.</p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August 2013. The List has been updated since then by the addition of 11 more priority groups of  medicinal products. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicinal Products on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the first top 20 priority groups of medicinal products by end Quarter 1 2014.  A second list of 20 priority groups of medicinal products has now been identified and this list includes montelukast products. It is expected the IMB will have completed assessment of these 20 groups of products in Quarter 4 2014. Details on when each group of medicinal products will be assessed for interchangeability will be published on the IMB website in due course (www.imb.ie).</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the maximum price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013 resulting in a 70% reduction in the price paid by the HSE for these products compared to May 2013. The second reference price for esomeprazole 20mg products was implemented on 1 January 2014 and the HSE expect to implement reference prices for esomeprazole 40mg on 1 February 2014 resulting in a 56% reduction in the price of these products compared to May 2013. The HSE also expect to implement reference prices for rosuvastatin products with effect from 1 February 2014 resulting in a 40% reduction compared to the prices paid in May 2013.</p><p>  In addition, the consultation process is also underway in relation to three more groups of medicines which have been designated as interchangeable by the IMB &ndash; Omeprazole, Lansoprazole, and Pravastatin. It is expected that reference prices will be implemented for these groups of medicines with effect from 1 March 2014. The HSE will continue the process of setting reference prices for the remaining groups of interchangeable medicinal products published by the IMB in accordance with the processes and timelines set down in the legislation. It is expected that 80% by value of the off-patent market for prescribed medicines will be subject to reference pricing by end 2014 resulting in further significant reductions in the price of generic medicines. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p></reply>

The current pharmacy based model results in over 70 million items being dispensed annually through local pharmacies across the State, including low population centres in rural areas. It enables pharmacies to receive deliveries each day from multiple wholesalers ensuring that all patients have continued access to essential medicines without delay. Under this model, as the drugs are purchased by individual pharmacies with no direct input by the HSE, there is no scope for the type of  purchasing arrangement envisaged by the Deputy.</p><p>  The Irish Pharmacy market is among the most competitive in Europe enabling any registered pharmacist to open a retail pharmacy business in Ireland. Recent media reports concerning reduced prices being charged for medicines at a new pharmacy in Dublin is an example of how the current Pharmacy model can deliver more competitive prices which will result in savings for both consumers and the taxpayer.</p><p>  Establishing an alternative centralised distribution centre capable of distributing 70 million items across the State would be extremely difficult to achieve and would absorb any potential savings available to the HSE from directly purchasing medicines or entering into a partnership with another jurisdiction to jointly purchase medicines.</p></reply>

The National Roadmap will be coordinated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and will be completed, following public consultation, in 2014.</p><p>  Roadmaps for adaptation will also be prepared by key sectors, including transport, and Departments will be guided by the National Climate Change Adaptation Framework on the preparation of sectoral adaptation plans.</p><p>  The NESC Secretariat analysis in 2012 made a strong case for the national climate challenge to be reframed and the sectoral roadmap for the transport sector will form part of that process.  It will set out a pragmatic approach towards achieving a transition to a low-carbon transport sector in the period up to and including 2050.  The early stakeholder consultation for the transport roadmap concludes on 7 February 2014.</p><p>  While no research has been commissioned in the last year, my Department keeps abreast of the extensive research being conducted in this area.  Such data is important in determining the range of measures necessary for the development of a robust and cost-effective policy platform for climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p></reply>
