Providing telecommunication services is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator. </p>  <p>  In April 2020, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, including students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and introducing new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. Consequently, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.</p>  <p>  Those commitments were further supported through regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, for a ComReg framework proposal enabling temporary release of additional radio spectrum rights of use. Ministerial consent was granted for this proposed providing flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodating increased demand arising from  Covid 19 related remote working and studying. Three-month licences were issued to three mobile network operators and were renewed on a number of occasions most recently to  to 1 April 2021.     </p>  <p>  In addition, ComReg recently published an alert on its website to help increase awareness of the unlimited data packages entitled: &ldquo;Looking for mobile unlimited data plans for remote school or college?&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Finally, as of March 3rd, 287 publicly accessible Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) have been delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention. High speed broadband services are being switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. </p></reply>

Technical testing and validation continues prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised by NBI that build works are continuing across the country in 11 Deployment Areas, including a total of 45,000 premises, and &quot;make ready&quot; work is underway in a further 18 Deployment Areas that include a further 64,688 premises.<i></i></p><p>The Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays both nationally and internationally, as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. </p><p>I am advised that NBI are working to provide greater functionality and more detail on their website with a rolling update of network build plans. </p></reply>

I acknowledge that to achieve these objectives will require fundamental changes in how we live our lives. The Programme for Government places climate action and environmental sustainability at the centre of the Government's policy agenda.     </p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, to be published shortly, will significantly strengthen the statutory climate governance framework to support achieving our climate objectives.  I am also currently leading the preparation of the 2021 Climate Action Plan, which will set out actions that must be taken across every sector in order to ensure we deliver on our commitments. To inform the next Plan, I will shortly launch a public consultation, complemented by a strengthened National Dialogue on Climate Action to create enduring structures for citizen engagement and activation on climate change across all of society. </p>  <p>  I also recently launched a public consultation on the introduction of a nationwide ban on smoky fuels, which when finalised will improve air quality delivering our environmental targets, but will also provide significant health benefits, improving quality of life and our overall well-being.</p>  <p>  The Sustainable Progress Index report highlighted New Zealand&rsquo;s Wellbeing Budget. I would note that Ireland is also taking concrete steps in this area and work is underway to deliver the Programme for Government commitment to develop new measures of well-being and progress, recognising that in order to achieve a well-rounded policy-making system there is a pressing need to move beyond uniquely economic measures. Work is also progressing across Government to mainstream the approach to equality budgeting, further illustrating the commitment to inform policy beyond economic values. These will be important developments as we move to advance our implementation of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </p>  <p>  This year, my Department will also lead the development of Ireland&rsquo;s second SDG National Implementation Plan to further guide implementation and promote awareness of the Goals. It is important to emphasise that meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the SDGs will entail ambition across Government and wider society.In this regard, the SDG Stakeholder Forum, established under the first SDG Plan, will continue to provide a further interface between the public bodies and civil society to inform the next Plan and support our collective work to deliver the SDGs. </p></reply>

These schemes offer partial grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency improvements for people at risk of energy poverty.</p>  <p>  Since 2000, over 400,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. Achieving these targets will allow many more households to reap health benefits associated with warm, energy efficient homes.</p>  <p>  SEAI grant schemes will be a central element of the Government's approach to achieving our national retrofit targets.  &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for residential and community retrofit programmes. Of this allocation, &euro;109 million is provided to support people vulnerable to energy poverty to retrofit their homes. This allocation will kick-start the first phase of our retrofit plan.  A further &euro;65 million has been provided for retrofitting the social housing stock through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is intended to publish a National Retrofit Framework later this year following publication of the National Development Plan. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-10a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031000075#WRC00237"><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepares inventories of past greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland on an annual basis. Inventories are compiled by the EPA according to international standards to meet EU and UN reporting obligations and to inform national policy development.</p>  <p>  The EPA, together with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland recently released a report entitled &lsquo;The impact on 2020 greenhouse gas emissions of COVID-19 restrictions&rsquo;. The report gives a first indication of Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 emissions and projects they will be 6% below emissions in 2019. Emissions from the transport sector have seen the largest fall and are estimated to have reduced by almost 17% from 2017 levels. On the other hand, emissions from the residential sector are estimated to have increased by 9% in 2020, as many people have been working from home. The report also states that focusing on climate action as part of a green recovery stimulus offers the opportunity to rebuild our economy, generate new jobs and respond to climate change. This is in line with Government policy. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has a Green New Deal for Ireland as a core mission. It commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade - and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, the latter being consistent with EU 2050 ambition. I have supported increased climate ambition at EU level through the European Green Deal, while asserting the importance of cost-effectiveness and fairness across Member States in pursuit of increased ambition. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which I will shortly take to Government for approval to publish following pre-legislative scrutiny, will significantly strengthen the governance structure in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate breakdown, including achieving our 2030 climate goals.</p></reply>

I am advised that the amount of light that might emanate from a proposed development is considered in assessing individual planning applications on a case by case basis. However there is no specific national strategy in place in relation to 'light pollution' under environmental legislation.   </p>  <p>  The designation by the International Dark-Sky Association of 700 square kilometres on the Iveragh Peninsula, County Kerry, as the first International Dark Sky Reserve in Ireland has been a significant addition to the county&rsquo;s rich tourism profile. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy is concerned with the potential impact of a pilot communications antennae project in the Black Valley area of Kerry. I further understand that officials at the Department of Rural and Community Development were contacted by a company which was interested in exploring possible sites for a small-scale pilot deployment of the company's equipment in the State, in line with the provisions of a trial license issued by the Commission for Communications Regulation.</p>  <p>  The company was provided with the contact details for the Local Authority Broadband Officers by the Department of Rural and Community Development. They also addressed the monthly Broadband Officers network meeting on 25 February 2021.</p>  <p>  The decision to proceed with the pilot is a matter for the relevant Local Authority and my Department has had no role in the matter. </p></reply>

This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services.    </p>  <p>  An Post last week announced a new partnership with Bank of Ireland to offer personal and SME withdrawal and lodgement services to Bank of Ireland customers across the An Post network of 940 post offices nationwide. This follows the announcement by Bank of Ireland that it is to close over 100 of its offices in Ireland. This builds on the agency banking services An Post already provides for a number of other leading banks including AIB and Ulster Bank with more than 4.5 million transactions and a cash value of almost &euro;1.5bn annually.</p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. I met with representatives of the  Irish Postmasters' Union last week to discuss the future of the network and how Government can support it's continued viability. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. As a first step, Government noted the Offline Services Report this week and agreed to establish an Inter -Departmental Group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to the post office network; that Group will report back to Government by the end of July. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no proposals to introduce a Government funded subsidy for the post office network.</p></reply>

In order to achieve our current EU 2030 emissions reduction target, the agricultural sector will need to achieve the full abatement potential identified in the MACC, which is an average abatement of 1.85 MtCO₂eq. per year from 2021 to 2030.</p>  <p>  The step change in climate ambition set out in the Programme for Government will need to be reflected appropriately in the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan. Far reaching policy changes will be developed across every sector, including agriculture and the dairy industry, including: </p>  <p>&middot;Building on Ireland's relative carbon efficiency in food production and ensuring the delivery of the measures identified by Teagasc to the fullest extent possible.</p>  <p>- Transforming the scale of organic farming, with delivery of a fair price for farmers at its heart.</p>  <p>- Developing a new strategy to expand afforestation, particularly Close to Nature Forestry and agro-forestry.</p>  <p>- Evaluating the potential role of sustainable bioenergy.</p>  <p>- Introducing a transformational programme of research and development, to ensure Ireland is at the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation, including in the bioeconomy; marine sequestration; improving agriculture breeding programmes; feed additives to reduce biogenic methane; agroforestry; paludiculture; and nutrient management.</p>  <p>  Land-use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and provide a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit. While the achievement of such improvements is not addressed in current EU policy, the Programme for Government commits to seeking to incentivise land use in the European Green Deal and broader EU policy. It also commits to evaluating the potential contributions towards our climate ambition from land-use improvements and set in train the development of a land-use plan, based on these findings. </p>  <p>  It is important that the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) protects farm incomes and sectoral supports consistent with these objectives, and that the National Economic Plan and NDP Review frontloads investment that is directly aligned with our climate ambition.  </p></reply>

Consideration of the report and recommendations is currently in progress.</p>  <p>  The electricity generation market in Ireland, the Single Electricity Market (SEM), is liberalised and open to both state-owned and private enterprises to compete in line with the requirements of the EU internal energy market. As such, while state-owned bodies may own and operate offshore wind developments, these bodies do so on a commercial basis. ESB is already involved in a number of ventures in offshore wind generation asset development. In order to avoid undermining the competitive principles of the I-SEM, the State does not directly own or operate, or plan to own or operate, any such generation assets. </p>  <p>  Instead, to progress towards the Programme for Government commitment of 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030, my department is developing the terms and conditions of the Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (Offshore RESS). The Offshore RESS will be the means for supporting offshore wind developments via a competitive auction based framework. </p></reply>

I am committed to addressing this critical public health and environmental challenge through a nationwide ban on smoky coal and enhanced regulation of other solid fuels. </p>  <p>  We have taken the first step in this process by launching a public consultation, to ask for views on how we regulate all solid fuels that contribute to air pollution. There are no proposals to ban the use of peat, wood or briquettes - the objective is to reduce the level of emissions associated with burning these fuels through enhanced regulation and to protect human health. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the system we put in place is as legally robust and as informed as possible, regulations will be introduced once the findings of the consultation have been fully considered and the required regulatory processes completed. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that for some householders, burning solid fuel is the main or only way they have of heating their homes. The goal over the lifetime of this Government is to provide support to retrofit these homes and, in the interim, to ensure they can be heated in a way that improves public health. This is being supported by an allocation of &euro;221 million for home and community retrofitting provided for in Budget 2021. This 82% increase on the 2020 budget is being funded through carbon tax revenue and includes &euro;109 million in additional supports for low income homes.</p></reply>

The final report was published by the respective Ministers on 4 July 2018. The report indicated that the Department of Finance would continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it would commission an independent external evaluation of the possibility or otherwise for promotion of the local public banking concept in Ireland. That further report was published by the Department of Finance in December 2019 and concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the July 2018 report.</p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done over the past few years to develop the network and this has had a positive effect for both postmasters and customers. This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. I intend to set out a series of next steps on the Offline Services Report shortly.</p>  <p>  We are working with An Post to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network. As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no proposals to introduce a Government funded subsidy for the post office network.</p></reply>

In April of last year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.    </p>  <p>  Those commitments were further supported through regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis. Ministerial consent was granted for this framework proposed by the regulator to provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand due to Covid 19 related working and studying from home. Licences were issued to three mobile network operators and renewed on  a number of occasions with the most recent renewal valid until 1 April 2021.      </p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention is being delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.</p>  <p>  The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 3 March, 287 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  Bringing connectivity to remote rural locations is central to promoting regional development and BCPs represent an important delivery in the early stages of the National Broadband Plan. </p></reply>

The Strategy set out several actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society. The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty. </p><p>Good progress has been made under the strategy including:</p><p>- Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) energy poverty retrofit schemes; </p><p>- A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed which has informed changes to energy efficiency grant schemes with further recommendations to follow later this year;</p><p>- Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for 2021.</p><p>- The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021. </p><p>Income supports from the Department of Social Protection  to help households with the costs of heating their homes have also increased. The Minister for Social Protection provides an estimated &euro;300 million in 2021 for a Fuel Allowance payment, of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;784 each year, from October to April, to an average of 372,000 low income households. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. The Department of Social Protection also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can include support with fuel bills in some cases.</p><p>Research undertaken by the Economic and Social research Institute shows that the proportion of households in or at risk of energy poverty has reduced from 28% in 2015 to 17.5% in 2020.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions also shows that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019. </p><p>A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and will inform next steps in relation to the development of a new strategy.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the National Retrofit Framework which will be published this year. Retrofitting of homes supports good physical and mental health by creating healthy indoor living environments with healthy air temperatures, humidity levels, noise levels, and improved air quality.</p></reply>

To date, over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme and in 2020 the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was over &euro;14,800.</p><p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the scheme work programme. This includes homes that: are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting an initial survey. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. This has been impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The average time for a surveyor to be allocated over this period was approximately 8 months. </p><p>Work in relation to recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme including the issue of repeat upgrade visits has been ongoing in recent months and is nearing completion. </p><p>Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021 - an increase of &euro;47 million on last year. In addition, delivery capacity has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. My Department is also in regular contact with the SEAI in relation to the operation of the Scheme. </p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards 70% renewable electricity by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. </p>  <p>  Government does not have any role in the delivery of electricity infrastructure on the ground. This is consistent with the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which states: &lsquo;The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies&rsquo;. Therefore I do not enter into any negotiations with EirGrid on the project and I have had no direct contact with local authorities or with local groups opposed to the project.</p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions.  Most recently and fully in line with the resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 16 February 2017, my Department commissioned an independent report incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector. The report from the International Expert Commission was published in October 2018 and it found that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this piece of critical electricity infrastructure. I do not intend ordering a repeat of such a review.</p>  <p>  EirGrid and ESB Networks, as our electricity system operators, always seek to work in close collaboration with landowners and stakeholders in the delivery of electricity infrastructure. Both companies are engaging with those living closest to the route of the interconnector. In that regard EirGrid has already set in place a variety of engagements locally, including the appointment of community liaison officers and a mobile information unit active in the area. I expect such engagements to intensify in the coming weeks and months, subject to Covid-19 national public health guidelines.</p></reply>

There is a range of steps set out in the Long-Term Renovation Strategy that are being taken to progress the retrofit of the building stock. I would highlight, in particular, the significant increase in resourcing provided to SEAI and the increased budget for support schemes across the residential, commercial and public sectors.  </p>  <p>  The Long-Term Renovation Strategy does not include all the policies and measures for the sector that will be necessary to meet the commitments set out in the Programme for Government to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in the period to 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. The additional policies and measures will be considered as part of the next Climate Action Plan which is currently under development. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the Long-Term Renovation Strategy was held from October to December 2020. A total of 22 submissions were received which are helping to inform the development of the next Climate Action Plan and future revisions of the Long-Term Renovation Strategy. </p></reply>

Partial grants are available for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency retrofits for people at risk of energy poverty. Since 2000, around 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. Last year alone, although COVID-19 restrictions had a negative impact on activity, over 17,500 homes were retrofitted with SEA  support.    </p>  <p>  &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes. This represents an additional &euro;100 million, or an 82% increase, on the 2020 allocation and is the largest ever budget for the schemes.</p>  <p>  Waiting times vary across schemes. Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, in 2020 the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months, which reflects the impact of COVID-19 restrictions. SEAI have advised my Department that this average waiting time should only ever be used as a general guide and waiting times may vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application.</p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Homes programme works must be completed within an 8-month period, starting from the date of grant approval.</p>  <p>  Aggregation based supports such as Community Energy Grant and the National Retrofit Scheme approve applications which meet the qualifying criteria on an ongoing basis within the annual budget.  Work on these schemes can commence as soon as grant approvals are given to each project with works to be completed by mid-October of this year.   </p>  <p>  Full details on the application processes for all schemes operated by th.

Significant increases in volumes of generation capacity, including from renewable energy sources, will be required to meet Ireland&rsquo;s electrification objectives including demand from heat pumps, electric vehicles and data centres. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan sets out a number of actions to ensure that data centres are accommodated in a sustainable manner including implementing flexible demand and other innovative solutions for data centres. This has been implemented by EirGrid for new data centres seeking to connect in Dublin.</p>  <p>  EirGrid has launched this week a public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future'. The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres. EirGrid&rsquo;s consultation will align with Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to further reduce electricity emissions which will be set out in this years revision to the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing by the Renewable Electricity Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) Steering Group, led by the the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in order to deliver on the step up in ambition in the Climate Action Plan of meeting 15% of electricity demand from CPPAs by 2030. A public consultation on options is currently underway and is running until the 31st March 2021; the relevant documentation is available at www.seai.ie  </p></reply>

Currently 12% of the energy we consume is from renewable sources. The National Energy &amp;amp; Climate Plan, which was approved by the Government and published last year, commits us to reaching a level of 34% by 2030. </p>  <p>  In order to achieve this target, the Government has set a target of 70% of the electricity we consume to come from renewable sources by 2030. We are currently over halfway to achieving this target and the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme will support further increases as evidenced by the successful first auction which took place last year. </p>  <p>  In the heat sector, the National Energy &amp;amp; Climate Plan envisages an increase from the current level of 6% renewable energy to 24% by 2030. This will be achieved by a combination of retrofitting 500,000 homes, installing 400,000 heat pumps, ensuring new buildings do not install fossil fuel heating systems and supporting the growth of renewable energy through programmes such as the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat. </p>  <p>  Growth in renewable energy in the transport sector will also be required which is within my remit as Minister for Transport. This will include significant growth in the use of electric vehicles powered by electricity that will be 70% renewable by 2030. It will also include growth in the use of sustainable biofuels displacing fossil fuels in conventionally power vehicles.  </p>  <p>  I would note the policies and measures currently in place are not sufficient to meet the commitments set out in the Programme for Government. An updated Climate Action Plan is currently under development and I expect this will further increase the rate at which we move away from fossil fuels to renewable technologies. </p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards 70% renewable electricity by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. </p>  <p>  Government does not have any role in the delivery of electricity infrastructure on the ground. This is consistent with  the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which states: &lsquo;The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions.  Most recently and fully in line with the resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of 16 February 2017, my Department commissioned an independent report incorporating international industry expertise to examine the technical feasibility and cost of undergrounding the North-South interconnector. The report from the International Expert Commission was published in October 2018 and it found that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this piece of critical electricity infrastructure. I do not intend ordering a repeat of such a review.</p>  <p>  In a separate independent study carried out by KHSK Economic Consultants and also published in October 2018, the issue of possible impacts on the valuation of homes was considered. The report "International Practice in the approach to and levels of compensation of property owners in proximity to high voltage transmission lines" indicated that transmission lines have a negligible or small impact on property values, and where an impact was found it tends to be short term only. It is to be expected that this project will attract new levels of investment and employment opportunities that will significantly benefit the local economy. </p>  <p>EirGrid and ESB Networks, as our electricity system operators, always seek to work in close collaboration with landowners and stakeholders in the delivery of electricity infrastructure. Both companies are engaging with those living closest to the route of the interconnector. In that regard I note that EirGrid has already set in place a variety of engagements locally, including the appointment of community liaison officers and a mobile information unit active in the area. I expect such engagements to intensify in the coming weeks and months, subject to Covid-19 public health guidelines.  </p></reply>

The long-term challenge for the sector is to achieve carbon neutrality, while not compromising our capacity for sustainable food production. The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs, and supports for farmers. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2019 includes measures for the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deliver in order to ensure we meet our existing EU targets. The next Climate Action Plan 2021 will further evolve the climate policy in the area, including in respect of the agri-food industry. We are working to identify actions to support increased carbon removals. Land-use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and  may provide a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit. As well as developing the next Climate Action Plan, we are evaluating the potential climate contributions from land use improvements, to set in train the development of a land land-use strategy </p>  <p>  Finally, we recognise the interlinked role the agriculture and agri-food sectors have with the waste sector and are committed to supporting the agri-food sector to evolve Ireland&rsquo;s capability as a leader in circular economies. We are investing in research in the agri-food sector to prioritise investment in climate and the bio-economy and will implement the National Policy Statement on the Bio-economy, providing the agri-food sector with new opportunities using biological resources in a sustainable and circular manner</p>  <p>  With the correct policy choices in the agriculture sector, we can reward farmers for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy, and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes.  </p></reply>

It is proposed as a 575km long (500km subsea), 700MW cable from the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes. </p>  <p>  The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for the people of Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal energy market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland.  It will also enhance security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p>  <p>  In late 2019 the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530 million towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. This grant was made possible by significant support for the project from the Irish Government that resulted in its designation as an EU Project of Common Interest.</p>  <p>  Extensive planning by EirGrid and a period of public consultation took place last year with regard to the development of interconnector infrastructure, following which decisions were reached on the interconnector's location in East Cork.  A further decision was arrived at by EirGrid regarding the establishment of an enhanced community benefit scheme for impacted communities.</p>  <p>  While I have no function in this matter, my officials have been informed that EirGrid will likely submit its planning application for Celtic Interconnector project in Spring this year with the project estimated to be completed in 2026.</p></reply>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government were consulted as part of this process.</p>  <p>The goal of the Charter is to ensure that every Local Authority embeds decarbonisation, sustainable development and climate resilience into every aspect of the work they do.  The Charter acknowledges the need to take collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address the impacts of climate change, while also committing Local Authorities to being advocates for climate action. </p>  <p>  Under the Charter, Local Authorities will measure the carbon impact of activities and implement measures to reduce carbon emissions in line with national objectives, including a 50% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030. In 2018 my Department entered into a five year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs).  Mayo County Council is the lead authority for the Atlantic Seaboard North region, which includes both Local Authorities in County Galway, along with those in counties Donegal, Sligo, and Mayo.</p>  <p>  My Department engages with all four CAROs on a regular basis, in particular through participation in the National Local Authority Climate Action Steering Group.Under the National Adaptation Framework each Local Authority has developed a Local Adaptation Strategy. These strategies are now being implemented, and each CARO is working with the Local Authorities in its region to both facilitate and monitor implementation of the local climate adaptation actions within the strategies. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Bill further strengthens the role of Local Authorities in climate action. It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to produce its own Climate Action Plan (covering both mitigation and adaptation) within eighteen months of the enactment of the Bill, and then subsequently at least once every five years. These plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and Local Authorities will have to liaise with each other in the preparation of these plans</p>  <p>  To build the necessary capacity, my Department is also funding and engaging with the CAROs in relation to the implementation of a new Local Authority climate action training programme. This programme will increase knowledge of climate change and the need for action among all Local Authority staff, and will facilitate both climate mitigation and adaptation at local level</p>  <p>  A further &euro;65 million has been provided for retrofitting the social housing stock this year  through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It is estimated that this funding will result in 2,400 retrofits to B2 or cost optimal equivalent though the final number is dependent on the initial condition and dwelling type</p></reply>

The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a public consultation which closed for submissions on 18 February last. Over 900 submissions were received from the general public and a broad spectrum of industry and interested parties.

It further commits to ensuring the Shannon LNG project is not included in the EU Projects of Common Interest list in 2021. I have previously confirmed that if an LNG project were to apply for inclusion on the 2021 list of EU Projects of Common Interest, Ireland would not provide the required Member State approval and accordingly such a project would not be included on the list. I would note that no LNG projects in Ireland have applied for inclusion on the 2021 list. Furthermore, the European Commission has proposed an update to the relevant regulation, which Ireland has supported, that will ensure no LNG projects would be eligible to be Projects of Common Interest in future. </p>  <p>   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also sets out that the Government does not support the importation of fracked gas and commits to developing a policy statement to establish that approach. My Department is in the process of developing the policy statement, which includes the consideration of any necessary legal and regulatory provisions.  This includes detailed examination of the European energy and environmental frameworks, in which our national laws operate, to ensure the policy statement will be legally robust. Once finalised, I intend to bring the policy statement to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. The review will inform future policy in relation to natural gas supplies, gas storage, electricity interconnection, emergency reserves and other measures that would enhance our security of supply. This will be done in the context of the doubling of the electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s final consumption and the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. It is in the context of this study that any changes to planning legislation could be considered. I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>Design work on the National Broadband Plan is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county in Ireland with over 186,000 premises surveyed as of the 3 March. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and the first fibre to the home connections are connected and in a test and trial phase in Carrigaline, Co Cork. They will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. Over the coming months retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network. A test and trial phase in Cavan and Galway will also commence shortly.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 3 March, 287 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools.</p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. </p><p>NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate acceleration of the rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>There are some 273,548 premises in Co Cork of which approximately 71% have access to high speed broadband through commercial operators. The remaining 79,424 premises, including premises in the area of Rathpeacon, are located in the Intervention Area in County Cork. </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 3 March 2021, over 186,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys have been completed or are underway in Co Cork in Midelton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon, Kilpatrick, Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh. Pre-build works are underway in Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown, and Upper Rochestown. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected  in Carrigaline and construction work is continuing with technical testing and validation taking place prior to wider release of the area.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie. </i>Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP and will provide high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 March, 287 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and by the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork BCP sites are installed and connected with high speed broadband  at Ballindangan Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, T.O. Park Labbamollaga  and Whitechurch Community Centre (which is located  5.45 Kilometres from  Rathpeacon, County Cork). Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of the schools aspect of the project was announced late last year and will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including information dissemination, trusted intermediary and advisor services and financial supports such as enabling grants. I will announce further details of this enabling framework shortly.</p><p>All projects successful in a RESS auction must establish a Community Benefit Fund.  For the first auction alone this amounts to close to &euro;4 million in funding annually. These funds will be aligned to incentivise investment in local renewable energy, energy efficiency measures and climate action initiatives. </p><p>Under the proposed new microgeneration support scheme to help citizens generate their own renewable electricity, for example from solar panels on their roofs, and receive a fair price when they sell the excess into the grid, renewable energy communities will be eligible for the Clean Export Premium, in addition to the Clean Export Guarantee, for a period of 15 years.</p><p>In addition, the Communities Energy Grant Scheme funded by my Department and operated by the SEAI, now with a budget of &euro;30 million, is designed to encourage and support home retrofit to a BER B2 standard, as well as energy efficiency upgrades in commercial, public, community and voluntary sector facilities. </p></reply>

Decarbonisation of our electricity system and upgrading our grid infrastructure will be critical to achieving this ambition. It will mean making far-reaching changes to our electricity system that will affect everyone. EirGrid have this week launched a detailed consultation entitled <i>Shaping Ireland&rsquo;s Electricity Future</i>which outlines innovative approaches to developing the grid in order to meet our ambitious 2030 renewable energy targets. Details on the public consultation and how to have your say are available at: consult.eirgrid.ie </p><p>Domestic sources of renewable energy will also necessitate significant grid infrastructure upgrades over the coming decade as microgeneration becomes more commonplace. </p><p>The recent Price Review decision from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) on the allowable spend on our electricity grid over the next five years signalled a dramatic increase in funds for grid enhancement. For example, ESB Networks' allowable capital expenditure has been increased by 84% over the previous period.</p><p>The major ramp up in the levels of renewables on our power grid to achieve the Government's 70% renewable electricity target by 2030 and the move to a highly electrified economy will give rise to challenges in ensuring security of supply and maintaining a reliable system for all customers during the transition. The winter capacity margin of available electricity supply over demand has reduced every year over the past five years mainly due to increasing demand, including from data centres, and peat generation exiting the market. The CRU and EirGrid, which both have statutory responsibilities to ensure security of electricity supply, are actively monitoring matters. </p><p>My Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. It is planned that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

My Department, under Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan, has engaged extensively with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to review the existing planning exemptions for rooftop solar PV micro-generation. That Department has agreed to update the existing exemptions that will include provision for apartments, community and educational buildings including schools and expect that these interim regulations will be completed and submitted to the relevant Oireachtas Committee in Quarter 2 this year.</p>  <p>  These regulations will need to be accompanied by Aviation Safeguarding Maps related to the construction of solar installations in the vicinity of aviation sites including heli-pads, aerodromes and major airports.  In recognition of the length of time that it is expected to take to complete the aviation safeguarding maps, the Department of Housing has decided to adopt the interim measure outlined above which would allow the revised regulations to be introduced prior to the completion of these maps, but with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations.The overall process for updating the solar panel planning exemptions to include the completed aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes  along with the finalized Statutory Instrument will be brought through the legislative process as provided for under section 262(4) of the Planning and Development Act requiring the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, which it is anticipated will be completed later in 2021.</p>  <p>  A Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is developing an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. The proposed support mechanism was outlined in a public consultation (now closed) last month and the submissions received are currently being reviewed.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to prioritising the development of micro-generation of electricity primarily for self-consumption, and a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators in the second half of 2021, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. </p></reply>

A key aspect of delivering on this ambition will be enacting the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, which will underpin the on-going development of policies and measures.  If Ireland is to meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, it is essential that we continue to drive the diversification of our energy mix away from fossil fuels.  The requirement to diversify energy supply must be balanced with the need to secure indigenous supply and the carbon footprint associated with importing fuels.  </p><p>In this context, Ireland operates within the framework of European Union legislation. The EU has recently revised the Renewable Energy Directive to include strict criteria in relation to the sustainability of biomass fuels. These criteria are due to be transposed into national legislation later this year.</p><p>While my Department does not gather data in relation to the import of wood pellets, the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) has been developed to financially support and stimulate the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users.  The SSRH, which is operated by the SEAI, provides an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems.  Eligible renewable energy technologies are supported through a multi-annual payment, for a period of up to 15 years, on the basis of prescribed tariffs.  The National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll-out of the scheme for the period up to 2027.  The introduction of these schemes provides an indirect stimulus to the indigenous wood pellet industry.</p><p>More broadly, the 2019 Climate Action Plan included a number of commitments to support the use of biomass to increase the level of renewable energy in the heat sector and, in the context of forestry policy, to seek to bridge the short term supply gap in indigenous biomass. Actions to further stimulate the promotion of the domestic biomass supply chain, as part of the overall development of a new strategy for the forestry sector, will form part of 2021 Climate Action Plan. </p></reply>

This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation is kick-starting the first phase of our retrofit plan.</p><p>Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households. This is a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation. &euro;112.5 million will be spent on expanding other existing SEAI grant schemes and introducing new and improved ones. The first of the new schemes was launched in September when a call for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) scheme issued. A &euro;30 million call for projects under the Communities Energy Grant scheme was launched in November. Examples of other initiatives to commence in 2021 and now in development include a new National Retrofit scheme focused on achieving B2 retrofits; a heat-pump ready homes campaign and a new Community Activation Scheme. </p></reply>

This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public messaging across a range of different information campaigns.</p><p>The overall communications strategy for Covid-19 is based on a coordinated response that ensures maximum clarity for citizens, businesses and our wider community. This aligns with both World Health Organisation (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) advice, both of which emphasise the importance of ensuring the general public is aware of the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, and further that a high degree of population understanding, community engagement and acceptance of the measures put in place are key in preventing further spread. </p><p>It is also recommended that communication strategies should target different audiences and provide the rationale behind the measures, also outlining the necessity to put a support system in place to provide essential services and supplies (e.g. food and medication), and to monitor vulnerable individuals. </p><p>Campaigns have included national and local radio, national and regional newspapers and social elements across different platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok.</p><p>Last Spring a number of campaigns were run as restrictions were initially imposed at the onset of the pandemic in order to explain the measures and to reinforce public health messages. Other campaigns focussed on specific sectors and topics, including supports for business, the postponement of the Leaving Certificate, the Return to Work and Community Wellbeing campaigns.</p><p>In May of last year, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published and a communications campaign was run to explain the different phases of the Roadmap.</p><p>During Summer 2020, the Jobs Stimulus Plan was announced by the Government and a campaign was run which focussed on restoring confidence and investment in the recovery.</p><p>In Autumn, campaigns aimed at Community Wellbeing and Keeping Well and reinforcing public health messaging were run.</p><p>The AntiViral campaign, launched in December, aims to engage with those aged 18-24, recognising that they have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. </p><p>This campaign is a way to demonstrate the positive role that our young people are playing in beating back this virus. It has had over 5.7 million interactions on the social platforms and reached over 300,000 people in that age demographic. The AntiViral hashtag had over 1.1 million views and the campaign&rsquo;s positive sentiment was measured at over 60%.</p><p>Also in December, there were campaigns to inform citizens of the advice for having a safe Christmas with family and friends, and guidance on shopping safely, to reinforce public health messaging. </p><p>It is essential that citizens, business owners and communities are informed of the decisions being made by Government, and campaigns are developed and implemented to make the public aware of these decisions.</p><p>Data from 25 of the Campaigns advertised in national press show an average reach of 49%, with 17 of these reaching over 50%. The average readership for the 25 campaigns was 1.9 million (with 16 of the 25 campaigns having a readership of over 2 million). Readership figures for regional newspapers is over 1.5 million for each campaign. Radio advertising had an average audience reach of 79%, with 19 of the campaigns advertised on radio reaching over 80%. </p><p>Digital display advertising was used in 13 campaigns, with a combined audience reach of over 33 million. This is an average of 2.6 million impressions, with six of the campaigns reaching over 3 million citizens.</p><p>Of 19 campaigns analysed that used Social media advertising, an average of 4.9 million impressions were achieved, with a high of 16.1 million impressions for the Publication of the Roadmap campaign.</p><p>Invoices for the campaigns run during Winter 2020 and Spring 2021 are currently being processed for payment.</p></reply>

As outlined by the EU Commission this may include measures to require companies to take actions to address their adverse impacts on social and environmental matters including human rights by way of a due diligence duty. </p>  <p>  Certainly, the matters signalled are of great importance and any EU legislative proposals will be examined carefully and subject to consultation with stakeholders to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position. The proposals shall be considered from the perspective of Ireland&rsquo;s support for human rights, their feasibility for companies and their directors having particular regard to SMEs, and the effectiveness of the proposals in meeting their objectives.</p>  <p>  In parallel, there is already an obligation on certain large companies in the EU to publish annually non-financial information in respect of their social and environmental impact including on matters such as human rights and climate change or explain where they do not.  The EU is reviewing the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU) with the objective of improving the way this information is made publicly available including the question of developing an EU standard to enhance these non-financial disclosures.  A legislative proposal is expected in April 2021. </p>  <p>  I look forward to the receiving the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals and to Ireland taking an active part in progressing these important and positive developments.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and for their families.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies including an obligation under sections 9 and 10 to engage in an information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies. Section 11A of the Act provides that, where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission. It is also an offence under section 11 of the Act where an employer fails to comply with sections 9 or 10. </p>  <p>  There is also an obligation under section 12 which makes it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment of the proposed collective redundancy.  My Department received notification of the proposed redundancies in the Rehab Group on 17th February 2021.</p>  <p>  It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility by law to pay statutory redundancy to eligible employees.  Negotiations on enhanced redundancy packages over and above the statutory entitlement are a voluntary matter between an employer and its employees and the Government has no role in this.</p>  <p>  The Government will work in a coordinated way to assist any person who loses their job. My colleague Heather Humphreys T.D. the Minister for Social Protection would be best placed to advise further on supports for jobseekers with disabilities, including the EmployAbility service which is an employment and recruitment service that helps people who have a disability to secure and maintain employment.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Workplace Relations Commission provides information on employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations, and can be contacted at Lo-call 1890 80 80 90 or via its website www.workplacerelations.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-10a.261.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031000078#WRF02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 140 together.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, however, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit. </p>  <p>  Doctors, including non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs), are on the critical skills list and are eligible for the Critical Skills Employment Permit.  The Critical Skills Employment Permit is Ireland's premium employment permit and is targeted at highly skilled people in eligible occupations deemed to be critically important to growing Ireland&rsquo;s economy, are highly demanded and highly skilled, and in significant shortage of supply in our labour market.  This permit provides for immediate family reunification, broad access to the labour market for dependents, spouses and partners as well as fast tracking to long term residency after two years. The criteria attached to this permit type includes the requirement for the non EEA national to have secured a job offer of two years. </p>  <p>  The employment permits legislation applies a range of criteria when considering an application for an employment permit including the remuneration offered and the period of employment as set out in the contract of employment provided with the application. The duration of the employment offered to any non EEA national, for any employment, is a contractual arrangement between the employer and the employee and my Department has no role in this regard.   </p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the HSE to put in place a process that allows for up to two year, multi-site applications for Doctors, including NCHDs, for employment permits but any agreement on duration of individual employment contracts is a matter for the HSE and the doctor concerned. </p>  <p>  The new Employment Permits (Consolidation and Amendment) Bill proposes to include provisions to streamline employment permit processes and improve agility by moving some of the operational detail from primary legislation to regulation including duration of an employment permit which would allow adjustment to be made more easily in response to changes in industry practices.</p></reply>

The aim of this scheme is to provide grants to businesses ineligible for the Government&rsquo;s other existing schemes such as CRSS and is designed to help with fixed costs. Wholesalers, suppliers, caterers and events companies down 75% or more in turnover and in receipt of a rates bill may benefit, including those that commenced after the 1st November 2019 where their turnover is below projections.</p>  <p>  I am committed to helping businesses respond to the economic challenges arising from the pandemic with a particular focus on firms that do not qualify for the weekly CRSS grant from the Revenue Commissioners or existing sectoral schemes in areas such as the arts, transport and tourism.</p>  <p>  This new scheme will help some businesses that are not eligible for existing grants, largely due to the fact that the premises they operate from have not been closed to the public. We estimate that this will help approximately 7,500 businesses. While the grant is modest it will be of substantial assistance to smaller businesses with some of their fixed costs like rent, utilities and security.  </p>  <p>  The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised and I plan to launch it in the coming days.</p></reply>

A feasibility grant of &euro;15,000 or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is lesser, is available to qualifying applicants meeting the required criteria.</p><p>In addition, on 20 November 2020, I announced &euro;8.24m in grants for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country administered through Enterprise Ireland. The funding will ensure that the Enterprise Centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services to support the next wave of Irish start-up companies. Enterprise Centres provide important infrastructure for entrepreneurs and are an essential part of the start-up ecosystem across Ireland.

An important action within the National Remote Working Strategy is to extend the mapping and classifications of hubs, as completed by Western Development Commission on the Atlantic Economic Corridor, across the country to develop national data on hub infrastructure.

The introduction of the new restrictions followed advice from NPHET that the situation with the virus had deteriorated to the point where there was an absolute need to reduce the level of mobility and congregation in order to reduce all opportunities for transmission.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Health advice, the additional restrictions required construction activity to cease from Friday 8 January.  The Government agreed a limited number of exemptions from these restrictions. These exemptions, which are set out in S.I. 4 of 2021, allow for the continuation of construction and development projects which are necessary for maintenance of supply chains in respect of certain manufacturing or information and communication services. The manufacturing and information and communication services include: chemicals, pharmaceutical products, medical devices, IT equipment, products necessary for national and international supply chains, personal hygiene products, broadband, data centres, etc. This has allowed certain key projects in the Exporting/FDI sector to continue. </p>  <p>  While I am not aware of the submission referenced by the Deputy, I am, of course, acutely aware of the ongoing impact the pandemic is having on our economy, and the challenges faced by the construction industry. Our approach will continue to be guided by the public health advice and will be kept under review. The current restrictions will remain in place until 5 April, when the issue of any potential easing of restrictions relating to construction will be considered further.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-10a.295.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031000078#WRF06000"><p>I am acutely aware that particular issues have emerged, and continue to emerge, for stakeholders as we all seek to implement the new EU-UK trade arrangements under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) consequent on Brexit.  These are the inevitable outworkings of Brexit, a policy choice by the UK with which we did not agree, with the UK now a &quot;Third Country&quot; from a trade policy perspective having exited the EU's Single Market and Customs Union as of 1 January this year.  One such issue is where the UK acts as a distribution hub for goods, including those sourced from the EU, as referenced by Deputy O'Reilly.</p><p>In that regard, &quot;Rules of Origin&quot; are the premise upon which any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) seeks to confer the preferential tariff rates - zero in the case of the TCA - on the members of the Free Trade Area encompassed by the FTA, namely the UK and EU-27 in this instance.  The TCA outlines the conditions which have to be met for goods to avail of a preferential tariff when moving between the EU and the UK. The primary condition is that goods being exported to Ireland from the UK must be of UK origin to avail of the 0% tariff rate and goods being imported to the UK from Ireland must be of EU (including Irish) origin to avail of the 0% tariff rate on entering the UK.</p><p>As the Deputy points out, goods can potentially lose their Union origin if they at any point exit customs supervision or are released into free circulation after they leave the EU as they transit to Ireland.  Having regard to the Union Customs Code, which sets out the rules applicable for goods brought into or taken out of the customs territory of the Union, on 27 January this year, the Revenue Commissioners issued eCustoms Notification 14/2021 which provides guidance and scenarios for the movement of goods from the EU to Ireland through the UK whereby the tariff may not be incurred.</p><p>For example, where the movement of the goods through the UK is a requirement, Revenue have advised that consideration could be given to using the &ldquo;transit procedure&rdquo; provisions of the Union Customs Code.  Under this mechanism, where EU originating goods are brought into the UK from an EU Member State, the goods can be stored in a customs warehouse in the UK and not lose their EU preferential origin thereby not incurring a tariff.  In this connection, there is a requirement to have a customs warehousing authorisation from HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs (HMRC) in the UK and HMRC provide advice on the rules and requirements relating to the Customs Warehouse procedure in the UK, including the conditions associated with the operations which can be carried out on the goods while they are in the warehouse.  </p><p>This Revenue Commissioners' Guidance also addresses Inward Processing and Returned Goods options.</p><p>Alternatively, where there is no need for the goods to transit through the UK as part of the import, the direct movement of goods from the EU to Ireland should be considered as an option by Irish importers thereby avoiding the goods leaving the EU Customs Union or Single Market. Therefore, if goods travel directly from the EU to Ireland, for example from a port in France, Belgium or the Netherlands, the goods have not left the Single Market and the Customs Union and thereby remain in free circulation in the Union.  In this regard, connectivity between Ireland and Continental Europe has been significantly enhanced through additional direct ferry sailings/capacity. </p><p>I should also add that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through our Enterprise Forum and the Retail Forum to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level. We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland hosted a webinar last month on <i>&lsquo;Rules of Origin: How Rules of Origin affect your business to trade to, from or through the UK&rsquo;</i>. The webinar focused on the implications of rules of origin for Irish businesses, and some solutions that can help to resolve the current challenges that businesses face. While the webinar was aimed at Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Office clients, it was also open to all Irish companies that trade with the United Kingdom and my colleague, Minister Troy, participated in the webinar. </p><p>Finally, Budget 2021 provided contingency funding for COVID-19 and for all Brexit outcomes and the Government is committed to assisting firms on a dynamic basis in responding to Brexit, especially those firms that are in the most severely impacted sectors.</p></reply>

The Agreement delivers on the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s objectives with businesses having access to zero rate preferential tariffs and quotas on goods traded between the EU and UK once the usual rules of origin for the EU-UK Free Trade Area are met.  This is vitally important for the agri-food sector, for example, which would otherwise have faced very significant additional costs and barriers when trading with the UK. </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department, in conjunction with Copenhagen Economics, undertook a comprehensive study to consider the impact of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s trade and economy. Following agreement in October 2019 on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK, my Department commissioned further economic modelling to reflect the benefits of the terms of the Agreement and Political Declaration/Protocol on Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  This Analysis forecast that growth levels over a decade would be 3.2 to 3.9 per cent below where it would otherwise be, depending on whether a "best-case" or "worst-case" scenario was modelled.  This outcome showed a reduction by almost half in the adverse impacts on the Irish economy that had been forecast for a trading relationship with the UK based on WTO terms, and the study identified a lessening of the negative impacts envisaged for the more generic FTA modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics analysis.</p>  <p>  As regards undertaking a specific appraisal of trade data for the first two quarters of 2021, I believe it is too early to commence a meaningful impact assessment of the concluded EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) at this point as certain parts of the TCA and the Northern Ireland Protocol have grace periods or temporary derogations attached to them. Furthermore, a framework for regulatory cooperation in financial services between the EU and the UK is to be agreed by March 2021 and the EU is assessing the UK&rsquo;s data privacy regime before deciding whether to grant a data adequacy decision in favour of the UK.  In addition, further changes will be introduced by the UK on 1st April and 1st July in term of SPS certifications and inspections regimes.  Therefore, we will not have sufficient statistical data available to assess the totality of the impact of the TCA until such temporary derogations and all elements of the Agreement are fully in force, including any further easements or derogations that may be agreed under the TCA structures.  However, I am fully committed to such post-implementation evaluation at an appropriate point, as soon as sufficient statistical data are available.  That assessment will have to take account of the impact which stockpiling ahead of 1st January and dampening in demand due to the pandemic, may have on such data, esp. as between the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, in advance or a macro-economic assessment, I should note that my Department and the Enterprise Agencies are in constant contact with industry bodies including through the Enterprise Forum which I chair and the Retail Forum, chaired, by Minister Damien English, to identify where sectoral and regional impacts of the TCA are emerging at an operational level.  In addition, Minister Robert Troy, in light of his responsibilities for trade promotion, has engaged in extensive outreach with business groups to address the many logistical challenges that the TCA has presented us with.  We have a large number of Brexit supports including planning vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, the Enterprise Ireland Ready for Customs Grant of up to &euro;9,000, as well as financial supports for adapting and restructuring business models and grants for research into new markets to assist companies respond to the new TCA dispensation.

Last year alone &euro;3m was allocated to local authorities in support of the Anti-Dumping Initiative, &euro;1 million of which was ring-fenced to combat illegal dumping activities arising from the COVID-19 crisis. This funding supported over 300 projects nationwide during 2020, including a national anti-dumping awareness communications campaign, &quot;Your Country - Your Waste&quot;, which I launched in November 2020.</p><p>My Department also supports local authorities and Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities through the annual Local Authority Waste Enforcement Measures Grant scheme, which supports the recruitment and retention of over 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel nationwide. Questions in relation to the full annual cost of waste enforcement by each local authority should be direct towards individual local authorities. </p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 3 March 2021, nearly 187,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Longford in the areas of Drumlish, Ennybegs, Moat Farrell, Cullyfad, Longford Town, Newtownforbes, Cloondara, Stonepark, Ardagh, Moydow and Kilashee. Further details are available on specific areas within County Longford through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie  , which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 March, 287 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Colmcille GAA Club (5.6 Kilometres from the premises), Corlea Heritage Centre and Aughine Community Centre. Sites at Ballymore Shamrocks GAA Club (6.8 Kilometres from the premises) and Mullinalaghta Community Center are installed and connected. Further details can be found at   .</p><p>Naomh Guasachta National School (Bunlahy) is installed by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative and Fermoyle National School is installed and connected.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at   . </p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. </p><p>Funding for the SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased to over &euro;109 million in 2021. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. This will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades, making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government.</p><p>In 2020, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to households under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,819. A further breakdown of the average costs under the scheme is set out in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Category</b></th>       <th><b>Description of works</b></th>       <th><b>Excluding VAT</b></th>       <th><b>Including VAT</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shallow</td>       <td>Includes attic and/or cavity wall insulation and windows occasionally</td>       <td>&euro;4,225</td>       <td>&euro;4,795</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deep</td>       <td>Includes external wall insulation (and any other insulation), and windows occasionally but no heating upgrades</td>       <td>&euro;16,135</td>       <td>&euro;18,313</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deep Heat</td>       <td>Includes heating upgrades and any insulation (including external wall insulation), and windows occasionally</td>       <td>&euro;24,431</td>       <td>&euro;24,729</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Weighted</b></td>       <td></td>       <td><b>&euro;13,057</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;14,819</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>A range of home energy improvements can be funded under this scheme. The upgrades that are recommended for any given property depend on many factors including age, size, type and condition of the property. For each eligible home, SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent carries out a survey of the home which determines the upgrades that can be installed and funded. The home is subsequently allocated to a contractor which carries out a further assessment of the property to confirm the initial recommendation.  A programme of work is then agreed between the contractor and SEAI. Decisions in relation to the recommended upgrades made by both SEAI&rsquo;s managing agent and contractors are informed by a technical operations manual. </p><p>The broad conditions for recommending works are set out in the table below.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Energy upgrade</b></th>       <th><b>Conditions for recommendation</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Attic insulation</td>       <td>&middot;        Pitched roofs<br /><br />&middot;        Where appropriate ventilation is possible</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavity wall insulation</td>       <td>&middot;        Walls consisting of an inner and an outer leaf separated by a cavity<br /><br />&middot;        Wall by wall basis<br /><br />&middot;        Where appropriate ventilation is possible</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>External wall insulation</td>       <td>&middot;        Solid or hollow block walls<br /><br />&middot;        Properties built after 1940<br /><br />&middot;        Wall by wall basis<br /><br />&middot;        Where appropriate ventilation is possible</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Internal wall insulation</td>       <td>&middot;        Solid or hollow block walls where external wall insulation not suitable<br /><br />&middot;        Properties built after 1940<br /><br />&middot;        Wall by wall basis<br /><br />&middot;        Where appropriate ventilation is possible</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Replacement windows</td>       <td>&middot;        Single glazed windows<br /><br />&middot;        Window by window basis<br /><br />&middot;        Where walls are also being insulated<br /><br />&middot;        Replacement doors are not included</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Heating upgrade</td>       <td>&middot;        Where no central heating or highly inefficient heating is present<br /><br />&middot;        Where walls and/or attic are insulated or can be insulated</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Heating controls</td>       <td>&middot;        As part of a heating upgrade</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ventilation</td>       <td>&middot;        Where walls or attic are being insulated<br /><br />&middot;        In adherence with current building regulations</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Draught proofing</td>       <td>&middot;        Secondary measure, eg where wall and/or attic also being insulated<br /><br />&middot;        As required</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lagging jacket</td>       <td>&middot;        Secondary measure, eg where wall and/or attic also being insulated<br /><br />&middot;        As required</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CFLs</td>       <td>&middot;        Secondary measure, eg where wall and/or attic also being insulated<br /><br />&middot;        As required</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The aim of such a system would be to help address the challenge of meeting increasing food demand internationally, while at the same time, contributing to climate commitments, including avoiding the off-shoring of agricultural activity to less carbon-efficient production systems. Such an initiative will require close collaboration and buy-in from other Member States and the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland has significantly increased its climate ambition, with the implementation of the Climate Action Plan 2019 and the step change in climate objectives set out in the Programme for Government, including an average of 7% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions per annum form 2021 to 2030. This increase in ambition will need to be reflected appropriately in the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency's recent  publication &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Environment: An Integrated Assessment 2020&rdquo;, demonstrates that the overall quality of Ireland&rsquo;s environment is on a downward trend, and the outlook is not optimistic, unless we accelerate the implementation of solutions across all sectors and society. In drafting the Climate Action Plan 2021, far reaching policy changes will be developed across every sector, including agriculture, that set us on the path of systemic change that is required for Ireland to become a climate-neutral and climate-resilient society and economy by 2050 at the latest.  </p>  <p>  With the 2030 Climate Target Plan and EU Climate Law, the EU will raise its ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030. This is a substantial increase compared to the existing 40% emissions reduction target. The Commission is preparing to present, by June 2021, an overhaul of all relevant climate legislation as part of a &ldquo;Fit for 55 Package&rdquo; to align with the newly proposed target. As part preparing this legislation, the Commission will consider the interactions of how emissions are accounted for between the agriculture and land use sectors.   . </p></reply>

Subsequently 14 projects have withdrawn from RESS-1 consisting of 13 solar projects and one wind project with a total capacity of 187MW (approximately 14% of  the auction capacity). The remaining 68 projects, representing 86% of the auction capacity, have entered into implementation agreements and provided performance bonds where appropriate in accordance with the Terms and Conditions. Letters of Offer have been awarded to these projects, which equate to approximately 1,088MW of new renewable generation. This includes seven community projects comprising of five solar and two wind projects.</p>  <p>  A number of milestones remain for each project to pass for them to be eligible for support under RESS-1. EirGrid and ESB Networks will be responsible for engagement with applicants to programme the  connection to the grid and commissioning of each project. </p>  <p>  RESS-1 projects will be supported through the Public Service Obligation (PSO) Levy and projects will be eligible for PSO support upon commercial operation of a RESS-1 project or on 1 July 2021 (whichever is later).

This is the level of excess generation and interconnection available to meet the peak electricity demand. This has reduced in recent years mainly due to increasing demand along with some power stations exiting the market and others not being available to generate when needed. Covid-19 has also impacted the maintenance of power stations reducing availability at key times. </p>  <p>  EirGrid's Winter Outlook highlights the risk of System Alerts which are periods when there is an elevated risk of not being able to meet system demand and/or risk of operational security limits being violated. There have been four System Alerts since August 2020 - most recently on Wednesday 6 January.  </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities and EirGrid are taking a range of actions to ensure adequate generation capacity is available to meet demand.

These supports incentivise projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 older homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. The development of a new retrofit plan to achieve these targets is well underway. Budget 2021 provided &euro;221.5 million in capital funding for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. This allocation will kick-start the first phase of our retrofit plan. It is intended to align the delivery of the Phase 2 of the Retrofit Plan with the review of the National Development Plan later this year.</p>  <p>Supports to enable businesses to become more energy efficient are also available from the SEAI.  &euro;17.3 million has been allocated for Business Energy Efficiency (Excellence in Energy Efficient Design, SME &amp;amp; Energy Auditing) and Business Renewable Energy (Support Scheme Renewable Heat) for 2021.  Information on a range of other supports that enable businesses to become more energy efficient including the SEAI&rsquo;s Energy Academy; information and advisory services; the Large Industry Energy Network; and Accelerated Capital Allowances is available at www.seai.ie  .</p>  <p>  The Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Programme provides capital support to retrofit public buildings with the objective of developing a scalable retrofit model that can be replicated across the wider public sector including schools.  The budget for this scheme has more than doubled to &euro;21 million for 2021.  This increase will provide continued supports to the public sector in delivering on its more ambitious 2030 targets outlined in the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Department, together with the SEAI, is also currently carrying out an updated Comprehensive Assessment of the potential for efficient heating and cooling in Ireland. In addition, a policy framework to encourage the development of district heating in Ireland is being finalised with a view to completing this work in early 2021. </p></reply>

Under Directive 2009/28/EC (&lsquo;the Renewable Energy Directive&rsquo;) Ireland committed to meeting a target of 16% of the overall share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020. In 2019, Ireland achieved  a 12% overall share of energy from renewable sources broken down as follows</p>  <p> - a 8.9% share of renewable energy in transport;</p>  <p> - a 6.3% share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling sector;</p>  <p> - a 36.5% share of renewable energy in electricity production.</p>  <p>  For 2020, a shortfall of between 3% and 4% in respect of the overall renewable energy target is projected. Accordingly, to ensure that we meet our 16% target and secure compliance with the Renewable Energy Directive, my Department negotiated international agreements with Estonia and Denmark to purchase statistical transfers in respect of 3.5 TWh of renewable energy, as provided for under Article 6 of the Directive. The purchases were completed at the end of last year.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to accelerating the deployment of renewable energy to meet the ambitious Programme for Government target of reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030, to meet the long-term target of climate neutrality by 2050 contained in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020, and to contribute to the EU-wide binding target, under the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (&lsquo;the recast Renewable Energy Directive&rsquo;), of 32% of energy from renewable sources by 2030. </p>  <p>  To achieve these goals, Ireland has adopted a target of 70% of renewable energy in electricity production by 2030, to be delivered through the deployment of additional onshore and offshore renewable capacity, including 5GW of offshore wind, which will be supported through the Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RESS), and through the increased deployment of microgeneration to be supported by a forthcoming microgeneration support scheme. </p>  <p>  The increased deployment of renewable energy will assist in decarbonising the transport sector, through increased use of biofuels provided for through the Biofuel Obligation Schemes and further electrification of the sector through the deployment of electric vehicles and associated infrastructure. In addition to energy efficiency measures, the decarbonisation of the heating and cooling sector will be achieved through renewable energy measures such as the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat and further electrification of the sector by the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes by 2030.</p>  <p>  The development of renewable energy sources will contribute to sustained and sustainable economic growth by supporting economic activity and new jobs, reducing our reliance on imported fossils fuels, and mitigating the long-term damage that rising greenhouse gases will cause to the national, European and global economy.</p></reply>

The development of the national retrofit programme to achieve these targets is well underway.  Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives.  The funding has already supported calls for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) scheme and the Community Energy Grant Scheme as well as a &euro;47 million increase in funding for energy poverty schemes.  Further SEAI administered retrofit initiatives will be launched in the coming months. </p>  <p>  A further allocation of &euro;65 million has been provided to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to support the retrofitting of local authority homes.</p>  <p>  It is essential that appropriate structures and governance arrangements are put in place to help us meet our retrofit targets.  For that reason, another key development was the designation of the SEAI as the National Retrofit Delivery Office.  Significant additional resources have been provided to SEAI to increase the capacity of the organisation to drive delivery of our retrofit targets.</p></reply>

Of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps.  National Broadband Ireland (NBI) will  address  the remaining premises through the NBP State led intervention.</p><p>The NBP State led Intervention will be delivered by NBI under a contract to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.  The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>In addition, a number of commercial operators have announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband.  Eir has said it will roll out fibre to a further 1.4 million premises, bringing their fibre deployment to some 1.8 million premises.  SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services.  Virgin Media is offering 250Mbps as a standard offering with 500Mbps and 1Gbps available to many of their customers across the more than 1 million premises that they cover.  Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p><p>The latest available Comreg Key Data Report on broadband for Q3, 2020 shows that fixed broadband subscriptions increased to 1.5 million which is an increase of 0.8%  for that quarter and an increase of 3.6% compared to Q3, 2019.  Of these, over 223k were fibre to the premises (FTTP) subscriptions representing 14.8% of the total fixed broadband in Q3 2020 which is up from 9.9% in Q3 2019. In Q3, 2020 approximately 80.4% of broadband subscribers had purchased broadband with speeds equal to or greater than 30Mbps.  Of all fixed broadband subscriptions 40.8% of subscribers purchased broadband speeds equal to or greater than 100Mbps. According to Eurostat, in 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s household penetration rate (including fixed and mobile broadband) at 90% is slightly higher than the EU average of 89%.</p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 3 March 2021, nearly 187,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed.  Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.

The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network and currently include primary schools, community centres, sports centres, agricultural marts, industrial estates and post offices.  To date most of that activity has focussed on community halls, sports centres and schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has now prioritised primary schools with no high speed broadband and continues to work with the Department of Education in this regard.  An acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p>  <p>  While schools are now clearly the main focus of this element of the NBP, other locations of a strategic nature in the intervention area continue to be assessed for the purposes of this element of the NBP.</p>  <p>  BCPs are a subset of a much wider national network of hubs.  In this regard the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development are chairing an inter-departmental working group which is seeking to enhance and promote the visibility of this national network and, as part of this exercise, are exploring the range of services that these facilities will offer.  </p></reply>

The consequences of failure are catastrophic, particularly for some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable people.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will hold its 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, United Kingdom, from 1 to 12 November 2021.  While the Paris Agreement is delivering on raising global climate ambition, further effort is required.

The EU continues to retain its leadership role on climate ambition and mobilising and supporting action of other Parties. </p>  <p>  The EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050.  This objective is at the heart of the European Green Deal and in line with the EU&rsquo;s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement.  The European Council has agreed, at its meeting in December 2020, to increase the EU's 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% relative to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June 2021, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland.

These targets concern sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, such as agriculture, transport, buildings and waste.  The ESR sets Ireland a target of a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The policies and measures in Climate Action Plan 2019 are designed to ensure that Ireland meets this target.  Within the Climate Action Plan there are specific targets for the energy sector to meet.  The Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.  The development of the National Retrofit Programme to achieve these targets is well underway. &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  This allocation has facilitated the expansion and improvement of existing SEAI grant schemes and the introduction of new initiatives.  The funding has already supported calls for projects under the new National Retrofit (One-Stop-Shop Development) Scheme and the Community Energy Grant Scheme, as well as a &euro;47 million increase in funding for energy poverty schemes.  Further SEAI administered retrofit initiatives will be launched in the coming months. </p><p>  The Climate Action Plan also sets a target for 70% renewable electricity by 2030. The Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) published their Energy in Ireland report in December 2020, which is available at .  The report shows that the share of electricity generated by renewables was 37.6% in 2019, up from 33.0% in 2018.  Wind was the largest share of renewable electricity at 32% with hydro at 2.8% and other renewables including biomass at 2.7%.  The European Green Deal commits to delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions at EU level by 2050 and increasing the EU-wide emissions reduction target from 40% to up to at least 55% by 2030, to align with the goal of the Paris Agreement limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  Ireland fully supports the enhanced ambition at EU level.  This ambition aligns with our Programme for Government commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Work is currently underway across Government through the development of a new Climate Action Plan for 2021.  This plan will include additional policies and measures in every sector to bring about the significant changes needed to transform our society.  Furthermore, the Government is undertaking a review of the National Development Plan (NDP), which will look at the necessary capital investment in areas such as energy, transport and the built environment to support delivery of the Programme for Government commitment. </p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below 2005 levels.  The latest EPA projections show that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by our targets could be between 2-4% below 2005 levels.  While these projections do not take into account the likely impact of Covid-19, they demonstrate the challenge we face to reduce emissions.  The EU itself has also an overall target of 20% emissions reduction by 2020 and has reported that it is well on track to meet this and is likely to exceed the target.  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation EU/2018/842 (ESR) established binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for the period 2021&ndash;2030.  The ESR sets Ireland a target of a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The policies and measures in Climate Action Plan 2019 are designed to ensure that Ireland meets this target. Ireland&rsquo;s target is expected to increase in line with ambition under the EU Green Deal to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030 versus 1990 levels.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, we are committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, in line with EU ambitions.  It also recognises the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in terms of plans and strategies to achieve these targets.   </p>  <p>  While emissions from the agrifood sector have continued to increase, Irish agriculture has a positive international reputation in terms of producing high quality, sustainable produce. The long-term challenge for the sector is to meet the national policy objective of an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise our capacity for sustainable food production.  The Government is committed to finding the balance between environmental, climate and biodiversity needs and supports for farmers.</p>  <p>  The existing Climate Action Plan includes measures for the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deliver in order to ensure we meet our existing targets.  This is underpinned by actions aimed at: reducing emissions on our farms by vigorously adopting the abatement opportunities identified by Teagasc; promoting diversification of land use as part of a gradual transition; harnessing opportunities in the bioeconomy; realising the potential of sustainable bioenergy supply opportunities; better management of our peatlands and soils; and developing clusters of exemplar practice.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Climate Action Plan will further evolve the role agriculture and in particular the agrifood industry play in supporting our climate ambitions, and responsibilities. We are working to identify actions to support increased carbon removals.  Land-use offers significant potential to sequester additional carbon and provides a new source of family farm income and rural economic benefit.  As well as developing the next Climate Action Plan, we are evaluating the potential climate contributions from land use improvements, to set in train the development of a land land-use strategy.</p>  <p>  And finally, we recognise the interlinked role the agriculture and agrifood sectors have with the waste sector and are committed to supporting the agrifood sector to evolve Ireland&rsquo;s capability as a leader in circular economies.  We are investing in research in the agrifood sector to prioritise investment in climate and the bio-economy and will implement the National Policy Statement on the Bio-economy, providing the agrifood sector with new opportunities using biological resources in a sustainable and circular manner.​</p></reply>

The UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Annex I Parties (which covers EU Member States) require that Annex I Parties should use the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to measure emissions inventories. This ensures consistency of measurement across Member States.  Emissions from heavy industry in the EU are managed under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).  The EU ETS limits emissions from more than 11,000 heavy energy-using power stations, industrial plants and airlines.  In Ireland, our ETS sector accounts for 25% of our emissions, with the remaining 75% in the non-ETS sector.  This compares to an EU average of 39% ETS and 61% non-ETS.  As the target for the EU ETS is set on an EU level, there is a level playing field for participants in the scheme across all EU Member States.</p></reply>

This means Ireland must deliver on its commitment to reach 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and that this must be planned and delivered in a cost-effective way that minimises costs to consumers.  The SEAI report on Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland (Jan &ndash; June) 2020 sets out the breakdown of electricity prices based on energy &amp;amp; supply, network costs, renewable taxes, capacity taxes, environmental taxes and other costs.  Section 4.1.6 on page 40 of the report provides a breakdown of costs to non-households (business).  Table 28 shows the breakdown of these costs for all EU member states in terms of cent per kilowatt hour.  The report is available online at </p><p>The SEAI, in its Energy in Ireland 2020 report, available at , shows in Table 22, Page 61, that electricity prices to Irish industry rose by 2% in real terms between 2015 and 2019.  The fuel mix for electricity generation is one factor that has a key bearing on the variation in the price of electricity. I n the EU, Ireland has a high overall dependency for electricity generation on fossil fuels, at 69%.  </p><p>Since 2015, energy prices in Ireland have increased by 6.7% in real terms, compared with an average increase of 1.6% in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Europe, and a 1.4% decrease in the United States over the same period based on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).  In 2019, overall energy prices in Ireland were 4.3% higher than in 2018, compared with an increase of 1.1% in OECD Europe and a 3.9% decrease in the US.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 3 March 2021, nearly 187,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete in County Donegal in the areas Milford, Letterkenny, Ramelton, Termon, Ballymacool, Kilmacrennan, Mullaghfin and Tommyscroft.  Further details are available on specific areas within County Donegal through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website <i>www.nbi.ie</i>.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence.  I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.  NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 March, 287 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed BCP&rsquo;s connected in Donegal are Ray Community Centre, Leghowney Community Centre (9.21 Kilometres from the premises), Dunree Military Museum, Cranford Coole Community Centre, the Gweedore Theatre and Meenreagh Hostel.  Further details can be found at <i> </i>.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Some 42 schools in County Donegal are to be connected by the end of 2022.  Further details are available on the NBI website at <i></i>. </p></reply>

This has been trialled on a pilot basis for those taking a theory test for trucks and buses during the months of December and January. The pilot is now being evaluated. The RSA is fully committed to extending the service to all categories of vehicles, however, I would like to highlight, this expansion of services will take some time. Operational, technical, logistical and contractual issues will have to be addressed prior to roll out of the service and it is expected to be at least end of Quarter Two before the RSA are in a position to offer the service for all test categories.</p>  <p>  When the Driver Theory Test (DTT) Service closed in late 2020 due to the latest restrictions, the backlog arising from the first suspension (March to June 2020) had not yet been cleared. This, coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements, led to further delays for those wishing to take the DTT.</p>  <p>  The RSA, together with its service provider, have put plans in place to significantly increase capacity within the service when it is allowed to re-open. To cope with the initial four-month suspension, the service increased capacity from an average pre Covid-19 capacity of 15,000 to over 25,000 monthly. A plan is being progressed to increase this capacity up to 50,000 per month when service resumes, to manage the backlog of customers and shorten waiting times.</p>  <p>  As you can appreciate, the first priority has to be public safety &ndash; we want to provide services, and we know that people are looking for services, but services can only be provided to the limit possible while preserving public health.</p>  <p>  As the scheduling of candidates is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and their contract provider, I have no power to intervene in individual cases. </p></reply>

Shannon Airport (as part of Shannon Group) has availed of many of these horizontal business supports, many of which have been extended into 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to these economy wide measures, &euro;6.1 million in emergency funding was approved by Government in June 2020 to assist Shannon Airport complete a hold baggage screening project, which had been suspended due to the impacts of Covid.  This funding was provided to ensure ongoing compliance with security requirements under EU Regulation 2015/1998.  </p>  <p>  In addition, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances being faced by airports and taking account of the recommendations of the Taskforce for Aviation Recovery, the Government announced an &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in November 2020, which includes funding for State airports in 2021.</p>  <p>  As part of that package, &euro;32.1 million has been allocated to Shannon and Cork Airports under a new Programme for regional State airports.  Capital funding requests from Shannon Airport under this Programme are currently being assessed by my Department.  </p>  <p>  In addition, supplementary support schemes have been developed to help address liquidity issues at our airports as a result of Covid-19.  These new schemes were approved by the European Commission on 24 February and have a budget of &euro;26m.  </p>  <p>  One of these schemes will help to compensate State airports, including Shannon, for damage caused by Covid-19 in 2020.  This funding will provide airports with the flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity when circumstances allow.  Shannon Airport will shortly be invited to apply for funding under this new Scheme.</p></reply>

The driving test is conducted in an enclosed space for a period of over 15 minutes, where physical distancing is not possible. </p><p>Given the significant risk to testers when conducting a driving test, Government has deemed that the driver testing service should be available ONLY for essential workers in Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions.  The Road Safety Authority offers driving tests to those who can produce evidence that they are an essential worker, in accordance with Government definitions.  No exceptions can be made.</p><p>My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to help the service meet the growing demand for tests within the current public health situation.  An additional 40 driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. Recruitment has commenced and a panel will be formed. However, hiring of testers requires advertising, selecting candidates and training. Newly hired testers require 7 weeks of training in order to be ready. Training is given by experienced testers, so while new hires are in training the capacity of the service is reduced. </p><p>The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols. </p><p>Until Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions have been eased, no progress can be made on addressing the backlog; however, the Road Safety Authority has plans in place for when the service is allowed to resume for all learner permit holders to be tested at the earliest possible date, and a gradual return of driving test times to their pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

In this context 12 regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP and the construction of a Distributor Road to the south of Athy connecting to the N78 is one of those schemes. Implementation of the programme of projects is on a phased basis and progression of each project is subject to the profile of annual capital allocations available to the Department. </p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code and the terms and conditions applying to regional and local road grants, capital projects are subject to review and approval at a number of stages.

Attending a flight training school is considered to fall within the category of education. On 6 January 2021, the government announced that all higher, further and adult education should remain primarily online. However, where such activities cannot be done remotely, such as practical and skills-based tuition, limited on-site presence is permitted and those attending such tuition can travel beyond the general restricted 5 km limit.</p>  <p>  Flight training is an educational activity that requires direct non-remote interaction with aircraft which cannot be replaced with online alternatives. Attendees of a flight school are attending a recognised training organisation and therefore may travel outside the 5km radius from where they reside. Not all those attending flight schools are necessarily trainee pilots. Some may already be qualified and employed commercial pilots attending the flight school to acquire a particular additional qualification or rating. As such they would be qualified pilots and considered essential workers. The completion of pilot training courses is time critical and attendees must complete flight training within regulated timeframes.</p>  <p>  All public health regulations and guidelines must be strictly adhered to and operational and cockpit procedures of the flight school must be in line with HSE Covid procedures.</p></reply>

I acknowledge that there are many  different cohorts across all areas of society who have being impacted by the increased demand on the service.</p><p>The driving test service is not currently operating as normal due to the impact of Covid-19<i>.</i>Tests are only available, under Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions, to essential workers. This has had a significant impact on waiting times.</p><p>RSA driver testers are undertaking driving tests in extraordinarily difficult conditions in the current Covid-19 environment. The driving test is conducted in an enclosed space for a period of over 15 minutes, where physical distancing is not possible.</p><p>Given the significant risk to testers when conducting a driving test, Government has deemed that the driver testing service should be available ONLY for essential workers in Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions. The Road Safety Authority offers driving tests to those who can produce evidence that they are an essential worker, in accordance with Government definitions. No exceptions can be made.</p><p>My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to help the service meet the growing demand for tests within the current public health situation. An additional 40 driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. Recruitment has commenced and a panel will be formed. However, hiring of testers requires advertising, selecting candidates and training. Newly hired testers require 7 weeks of training in order to be ready. Training is given by experienced testers, so while new hires are in training the capacity of the service is reduced.</p><p>The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols.</p><p>Until Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions have been eased, no progress can be made on addressing the backlog. However, the Road Safety Authority has plans in place for when the service is allowed to resume for all learner permit holders to be tested at the earliest possible date, and a gradual return of driving test times to their pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

This plan included proposed measures needed to reduce current waiting times. Amongst the range of options outlined, the RSA sought sanction to recruit 80 additional testers.</p>  <p>  My Department examined this request in detail in relation to its robustness and deliverability, while also taking into account financial and other implications. Following this review, my Department approved the hiring of 40 temporary driver testers. This was subsequently also approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers that I previously gave sanction to rehire during the latter part of 2020.</p>  <p>  I would like to point out that the provision of extra testers will not on its own suffice to address the problem. One of the difficulties is with the reduced capacity of driving test centres, given limits on throughput due to Covid restrictions. Even with the additional 40 recruits, the RSA will need to look at possible additional temporary test centres.</p>  <p>  The Department and the RSA will monitor how the new testers are impacting the system as they come on stream from June 2021 and as the Covid restriction level reduces. I will keep the situation under review as to whether further recruitment of additional testers will be necessary in the latter half of 2021.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.</p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Government, supported by the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base. There are currently around 28,000 EVs under taxation in Ireland and, of these, according to recent figures from the National Vehicle and Driver File, 14,363 fully electric vehicles are registered in Ireland.</p><p>In accordance with Programme for Government commitments, my Department is expanding the scope of vehicle types to include personal electrified modes of transport. For example, legislation is being drafted to enable the legal use of electric scooters. Subject to resolution of outstanding issues relating to road safety and the movement of traffic, I intend to bring forward amendments to the relevant primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill comes before the Oireachtas in the next few months. Accordingly, I am confident that we are making real progress towards the delivery of our ambition for the transition to an electrified and low-carbon transport system.</p><p>With regard to public transport, moves are already afoot to electrify the bus and rail networks. To date, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses have been ordered, of which 100 should be operational by mid-2021, with the remainder to be delivered before year end. The National Transport Authority (NTA) are also tendering for both single- and double-deck fully electric town buses, with the first vehicles expected to arrive towards the end of next year. My Department is also funding electric vehicle pilot projects in rural areas under the Local Link programme.</p><p>Finally, building on the eSPSV grant scheme that was in place for the last 2 years, I have introduced an EV scrappage scheme to support taxi and hackney drivers switching from older vehicles to EVs.</p></reply>

Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date. Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle. Any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued and does not constitute a 12 month warranty for their condition.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy notes, the Road Traffic (National Car Test) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 amended the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415 of 2017) to provide an exceptional 4 month extension to test due dates for vehicles with a NCT certificate expiry date on or after 28th March 2020, where the vehicle was not first registered after August 2016. The extension was directly linked to the suspension of NCT services in March 2020 due to Covid 19 and was granted to extend the validity of NCT certificates which would have expired at a time when it was not possible to renew such certificates.</p>  <p>  The suspension permitted the NCT Service to put in place a comprehensive range of measures to ensure compliance with public health advice and health and safety guidelines which facilitated resumption of services from July 2020.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  Several targeted Government Decisions made throughout the crisis, in addition to general supports such as the wage subsidy scheme, have provided much needed support to the sector, particularly the decisions to:</p>  <p>  - substantially increase the 2020 budget for the existing PSO system;</p>  <p>  - introduce temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators (CBOs) for an initial period of 6-months;</p>  <p>  - provide a higher-than-normal provision for PSO funding in the 2021 budget due to the ongoing impact of Covid-19 on the public transport sector; and</p>  <p>  - extend the provision of temporary funding supports for the CBOs for a further 3 months, with the option to extend monthly thereafter subject to engagement  with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  Prior to the Covid-19 health emergency, licensed operators operated non-subvented bus services on a commercial basis. However, due to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue, these services were no longer commercially viable.  As such, on the 25th June 2020 Government decided to introduce new temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services. These temporary supports were initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, has entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.</p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on the 26th of January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports to the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment extended to end June 2021, the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow.</p>  <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p></reply>

Certain transition periods are included within the new EU regulation including the continuing use of drones that do not carry a CE marking.</p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 lays down detailed provisions for the operation of unmanned aircraft systems as well as for personnel, including remote pilots and organisations involved in those operations. Regulation (EU) 2019/947 became applicable on 31 December 2020. It allows for a transition period of two years for the phasing in of some of the technical requirements, such as the design requirements set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945.</p>  <p>  Under the EU Regulatory regime, drone operations are categorised under three broad types &ndash; Open, Specific and Certified, with different regulatory considerations applied across each operation type. Regulation (EU) 2019/947 sets operational rules that apply to both professional drone operators and those flying drones for leisure. These rules not only address safety but also contain important building blocks to mitigate drone related security risks. At the end of 2020, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) launched a new registration system for drone operators to comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/947 which, as of 31 December 2020, requires any drone over 250g or a drone with a camera or sensor to be registered with national authorities. Other mitigation measures such as remote identification and definition of geographical zones are being phased in over the next 2 years (1 January 2022).</p>  <p>  The Small Unmanned Aircraft (Drones) and Rockets Order 2015 (SI 563 of 2015) still applies except where replaced by the new EU regulations. (For example the provisions related to rockets and offences still apply). </p>  <p>  There is scope within the regulation for drone manufacturers to supply retrofit packages for drones already on the market, bringing the drones to the existing CE class mark. It is unlikely, however, the manufacturers will do this to any great extent. </p>  <p>  The use of existing drones that are not CE marked will possibly be extended to 2023 due to delays in the publication of the harmonised standards for applying the CE marking to drones.  A decision on this, to be taken at a European level, is expected in mid-2021.</p></reply>

Competition in the sector is vital to ensure that businesses and consumers have a range of banking options available when using financial services and accessing credit. </p>  <p>  The withdrawal of Ulster Bank is regrettable for its customers and staff and is an unfavourable development for competition in the banking market. It is also a reflection of the wider challenges banking is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad.  The impact of Covid-19, coming on top of weak enough economic growth in Europe and America, has already been seen in European banking with consolidation and mergers in other European markets. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, our banks were amongst the worst hit by the previous crisis. Since then, overall conditions for banks have been difficult despite Ireland&rsquo;s strong recovery from the previous crisis. These conditions include the long period of low, now negative, interest rates that have severely depressed margins, having to continue to deal with the bad debt legacy of the last crisis, low credit demand, both in mortgages and SME lending and the relatively small size of the Irish market.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are major changes driving the consolidation elsewhere. The innovations introduced by fintechs and their increasing market penetration are reducing traffic into the branch networks run by traditional banks. Competing with lean and nimble online firms while coping with high cost structures is posing a considerable challenge for the traditional full service sector and we are seeing cutbacks in these entities in terms of staff, branches and initiatives to move their customers online.  </p>  <p>  The announcement by Bank of Ireland last week that it is to close 103 branches in Ireland &ndash; 15 of which are in the north - is further evidence of the impact technology is having on banking and the way the public interacts with banks.  However, it is accepted that many people will still need or want to carry out their banking activities in person and it is a welcome development that Bank of Ireland is now entering into a new partnership with An Post that will allow personal and business customers to use their local post office for a range of banking services, including cash withdrawal and lodgements.</p>  <p>  NatWest is in early stage discussions with PTSB and other strategic banking counterparties about their potential interest in certain retail and SME assets, liabilities and operations.  A Memorandum of Understanding which has been signed with AIB regarding certain corporate and commercial loans, signals a potentially important development for the Irish banking sector.  While these are primarily commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for both AIB and PTSB, but more importantly for Ulster Bank&rsquo;s customers, staff and the Irish economy generally. </p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. </p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. </p>  <p>  This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in the main it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  In passing on some of these costs, it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce legislation to allow banks to differentiate between customers in different sectors. Firstly, it does not appear to me to be either fair or equitable to distinguish between different classes of customers with some benefiting from an exemption to negative interest rates and others not benefiting. In addition, the unintended consequences of such a decision need to be considered. Banks are operating in a challenging business and economic environment and may choose not offer services to customers if it is not possible for to pass on some of the costs associated with the delivery of those services to these customers.</p></reply>

It recognises the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unfair to tax income earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query, section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties unless this is specifically provided for in legislation. Therefore, neither Revenue nor I can comment on the tax affairs of any individual or company. However, as the State is the largest shareholder in PTSB, AIB and Bank of Ireland (owning 75%, 71% and 14% respectively of each bank), the Department of Finance monitors the overall strategic direction of these banks and develops and executes plans to optimise the value of the State&rsquo;s investments. </p><p>In addition, Deputies may recall that in 2018, Department of Finance officials produced a detailed technical note for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally (see ). It was further updated and re-circulated to members during the 2019 Finance Bill process. Based on the banks&rsquo; published annual reports, the technical note estimated that the value of tax losses brought forward that were utilised by the State&rsquo;s three banks in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were as shown below. Data for 2016 was not included in the report and the banks&rsquo; 2020 annual reports have only recently been published and have not yet been analysed by officials. </p><p><b>Value of tax losses forward utilised per annual reports</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AIB </td>       <td>&euro;137m </td>       <td>&euro;114m </td>       <td>&euro;16m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bank of Ireland (BOI)</td>       <td>&euro;84m*</td>       <td>&euro;91m </td>       <td>&euro;33m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PTSB </td>       <td>&euro;12m </td>       <td>&euro;0m </td>       <td>&euro;6m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>&euro;233m </td>       <td>&euro;205m </td>       <td>&euro;55m </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The annual reports state that the banks have tax losses in Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK); although the above figures include utilisation of UK losses, they are understood to only represent only a small portion of the total. *Also, BOI executed an intragroup transaction in 2017 for the purpose of capital optimisation which reduced the quantum of tax losses utilised in the year to &euro;17 million. Accordingly, the amount of tax losses utilised in 2016 of &euro;84 million has been used in the above table as being representative of a more typical year.</p><p>It should also be noted that these banks do currently pay Irish corporation tax, as the tax losses do not shelter profits made in all their corporate entities in Ireland. At an Oireachtas committee meeting in 2018, Bank of Ireland indicated that it paid corporation tax of &euro;31 million in Ireland in 2017. AIB also disclosed that it paid &euro;58m in corporation tax in Ireland over the two years 2016/7, which would be an average of &euro;29m each year. According to the banks&rsquo; 2019 financial statements, Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB incurred current year corporation tax charges in Ireland totalling &euro;70 million. These corporation tax payments are in addition to the bank levy, which raised &euro;295 million over the years 2017 to 2019, as shown below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Bank levy </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AIB </td>       <td>&euro;49m </td>       <td>&euro;49m </td>       <td>&euro;35m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>BOI </td>       <td>&euro;29m </td>       <td>&euro;29m </td>       <td>&euro;34m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>PTSB </td>       <td>&euro;23m </td>       <td>&euro;23m </td>       <td>&euro;24m </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>&euro;101m </td>       <td>&euro;101m</td>       <td>&euro;93m</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It recognises the fact that a business cycle runs over several years and that it would be unfair to tax income earned in one year and not allow relief for losses incurred in another. Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period. </p><p>Each year, Revenue publishes detailed analyses of the previous year&rsquo;s corporation tax returns and payments which includes breakdowns of corporation tax loss relief by sector (available at ). These reports explain that, while a company must record losses claimed on their corporation tax returns, losses can only be used if there is an appropriate corporation tax liability to offset. Also, after the first year of claim, any losses and capital allowances carried forward are combined in tax returns data. Therefore, it is not possible to separately identify capital allowances and losses in the carry forward at aggregate level and the figures below for loss relief include excess capital allowances carried forward.</p><p>The amount of loss relief used in all 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax returns is as shown below. These figures include current year losses used in each year (i.e. losses incurred in the current year and offset against other sources of income) in addition to prior-year losses carried forward into that year. Revenue is currently analysing the 2019 corporation tax returns and will publish the results of this analysis later this year (the last of these returns were not due to be filed until September 2020). 2020 corporation tax returns are due to be filed up to September 2021 and Revenue will publish their analysis of these returns in 2022.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Revenue analysis of corporation tax loss relief </th>       <th>2016  </th>       <th>2017  </th>       <th>2018  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loss relief used </td>       <td>&euro;14.9 bn </td>       <td>&euro;14.4 bn </td>       <td>&euro;13.4 bn </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>An analysis of loss relief used on the corporation tax returns for 2018 by company size by number of employees is shown in the following table. It should be noted that this data refers to the individual companies claiming the loss relief. Where such companies form part of a larger corporate group, the overall level of related employment may be significantly larger. Similar analysis is not readily available for earlier years, but I am advised that the distribution is not expected to vary greatly from year to year.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of employees </th>       <th>Number of companies availing of loss relief </th>       <th>Estimated loss relief used&euro; bn </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Less than 10 </td>       <td>20,733 </td>       <td>7.4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11 to 49 </td>       <td>4,203 </td>       <td>1.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>50 to 249 </td>       <td>1,034 </td>       <td>1.4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>250 or more </td>       <td>235 </td>       <td>2.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>26,205 </td>       <td>13.4 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It should also be noted that the above tables show the amount of loss relief used by companies, but the <i>value</i>of this loss relief depends on whether the losses were incurred in the course of a trade that is taxable at 12.5% or 25%. (The profits of an &lsquo;excepted trade&rsquo; are chargeable to corporation tax at the 25% rate. An &lsquo;excepted trade includes&rsquo;: (i) subject to exclusions, a trade of dealing in or developing land; (ii) a trade involving working scheduled minerals, mineral compounds or mineral substances; and (iii) a trade relating to certain petroleum activities). </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the value of loss relief used for all years up to 2018, the latest year available, is published at . This includes the cost associated with current year losses used and the cost of claims by self-employed taxpayers registered for income tax (Revenue advises me that over 90% of the cost shown for 2018 is associated with companies). </p></reply>

In order to claim the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, taxpayers are required to upload a copy of their receipt(s) for qualifying expenditure to the Revenue Receipts Tracker and then make a formal claim for the tax credit when submitting their annual Income Tax Return. </p><p>To take the second part of the Deputy's question first, as I indicated on a number of occasions in response to Parliamentary Questions towards the end of last year, when the scheme was announced in late July 2020, it was tentatively estimated that it could involve an Exchequer cost of about &euro;270 million.  This was budgeted for over the two years 2021 and 2022 and was based on 2.15 million individual taxpayers fully availing of a tax credit of &euro;125.Also, as was indicated at the time, the measure was introduced in anticipation that the economy would be on the way to being fully open, and there would be mobility across our country. We know now that this has not been the case for much of the period since the commencement of the scheme on 1 October 2020.  Public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.  </p><p>At the same time, since 1 October 2020, a total of 56,016 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 4 March 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;9,207,244, and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,841,449, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question about the amount paid out under the scheme, Revenue have advised me that when it comes to tax credits, some taxpayers will get refunds whereas some will have the credit to offset against underpayments along with a number of other credits they claim. As at 7 March 2021 a total of 8,995 claims have been included in Income Tax Returns for 2020 for the Stay and Spend credit. These claims relate to &euro;3,206,048 of the qualifying expenditure recorded on the Revenue Receipts Tracker to date and the tax cost of same amounts to some &euro;641,000. However, as the filing deadline for the 2020 Income Tax Return is not until 31 October 2021, information on the total number of claims and cost for the 2020 year of assessment will not be available until after the filing date and the returns have been processed.  Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this new scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme.</p><p>Decisions on next steps relating to the scheme have yet to be taken and I will continue to assess matters as circumstances evolve. </p></reply>

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer. The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers. The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free. By contrast, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.</p><p>As I announced on Budget day, in addition to these existing measures, Revenue have agreed to allow broadband to qualify for this relief. This apportionment is based on the number of days the person spent working from home in year with 30% of the apportioned value accepted by Revenue as related to work in the home.</p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end. Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p><p>Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax which may be viewed at the following link:  </p><p>Finally, the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, commits the Tax Strategy Group to reviewing the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The Tax Strategy Group will take account of the economic, financial and organisational implications arising from the experience of remote working during the pandemic, and assess the merits of further enhancements for consideration in the context of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The carbon component is also referred to as carbon tax. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that if the lubricants mentioned in the correspondence provided by the Deputy are for purposes other than fuel for motor vehicles or heating, MOT does not apply. As the MOT becomes payable when the Customs declaration is lodged, it is important that the product is correctly classified and that where applicable, the necessary excise and carbon tax exemption codes are entered on the Customs declaration to ensure that excise related duties are not applied to products that are not fuel for motor vehicles or for heating. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that in relation to the business concerned, it is engaging with the business in relation to the classification of products and the procedures for applying excise and carbon tax exemption codes for the products where applicable and that engagement is ongoing.</p><p>Further information on the Mineral Oil Carbon Charge is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: . </p></reply>

The Central Bank has informed my officials that its focus regarding branch closures is to ensure that banks adhere to the relevant requirements in the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) and how banks communicate the closures to their customers.</p><p>Banks must ensure that they communicate in a clear and timely way with customers regarding any such changes, including the closure of branches, and in particular inform them about any alternative channels available to them to avail of banking services.  Banks must also provide affected vulnerable customers with the assistance necessary to ensure that those customers can retain full access to basic financial services, albeit in many cases at another branch location.</p><p>The Code sets out important requirements to ensure that consumers are fully informed of any closures or changes in services, and have time to make alternative arrangements. Under the Code, any bank that intends to close, merge or move a branch must:</p><p>- notify the Central Bank immediately;</p><p>- provide at least two months&rsquo; notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements;</p><p>- ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to its closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided; and</p><p>- notify the wider community of the closure, merger or move in the local press in advance.</p><p>When notification is received in accordance with Provision 3.12, the Central Bank engages with the banks to ensure the impact of the decision has been carefully considered across its full customer base and at the appropriate levels. The bank must ensure that its communications to customers are clear and transparent and that it seeks to assist vulnerable customers to mitigate the effect of the branch closure as much as possible.  </p><p>While decisions relating to the business model of regulated firms are commercial matters for the boards of those firms, the Central Bank expects them to take a consumer-focused approach in respect of any decision that affects their customers. Any decision by a board to close bank branches must be supported by an analysis and understanding of the impact the decision will have across its customer base. </p><p>I am advised by the Central Bank that there is no requirement for it to maintain a register of branch closures per year or by county. Accordingly, it does not have a breakdown by county location but it has sourced the following information.</p><p><b>Data on Branch Closures 2010 &ndash; 2020</b></p><p>The below table provides the total number of branches closed permanently each year by the five main retail banks from 2010 to 2020 inclusive.

The Central Bank of Ireland acts as an agent for the Minister in issuing all Irish coin, both circulating and commemorative. The Central Bank has responsibility for the design, production and issuance of euro coins. </p>  <p>  Under European guidelines, euro coins have a common obverse side and individual countries in the Eurosystem are not permitted to change the obverse side of a euro coin. </p>  <p>  The design on the reverse side of the Irish euro coin is the harp, which is a symbol synonymous with Ireland and has been always depicted on Irish coins. Accordingly, the Minister is not considering replacing the harp with Irish animals on the Irish euro coins.</p>  <p>  Over the years, the commemorative coin programme has celebrated a wide variety of themes, including animals and wildlife. Between 2010 and 2012, the Central Bank issued three silver proof coins to honour the Percy Metcalfe designs of the first coins of the Irish Free State. These coins commemorated the images of the horse, the salmon and the Irish Wolfhound. The theme of the Annual Mint Set to be issued 2021 is &lsquo;The Irish Honey Bee&rsquo; and its role within the environment.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is seeking submissions from the public, until Friday 12 March 2021, in relation to the collector coin programme for 2022. All submissions, including any submission relating to the inclusion of Irish animals on our coin, will be considered as part of the commemorative coin programme.</p>  <p>  The Collector Coin Unit at the Central Bank can be contacted directly at coindesign@centralbank.ie.</p></reply>

However, the reality is that our whole economy and labour market have been rapidly transformed by this unprecedented shock and nearly all sectors have been negatively impacted either directly or indirectly.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of over &euro;2.2 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;378m granted to over 47,600 employers in respect of over 537,100 employees.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible.  Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that a key business support such as the EWSS should remain in place at current levels of subsidy until the end of the second quarter of 2021.</p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the scheme will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependant on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>Borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2021, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% were receiving other supports from lenders.</p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks. However, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

I have no role in the day to day workings of the office or in the decisions which he takes.  </p><p>One of the main roles of the Ombudsman is to investigate, mediate and adjudicate complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman was established on 1 January 2018, by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 (&lsquo;the Act&rsquo;). The Act outlines the functions of the FSPO in the investigation of complaints against financial service providers and pension providers.  </p><p>Section 44(2)(a)(i) of the Act prescribes that </p><p>&ldquo;<i>a complainant may not make a complaint&hellip;where &ndash; the conduct giving rise to the complaint is or has been the subject of legal proceedings before a Court or Tribunal</i>.&rdquo; </p><p>This position is however, counterbalanced by the provisions of Section 50(1) which provides that:</p><p><i>&ldquo;Notwithstanding Section 44(2)(a)(i)</i><i>the Ombudsman may accept a complaint against a financial service provider or a pension provider that has initiated legal proceedings in relation to a matter to which the complaint relates, where the Ombudsman believes, based on reasonable grounds, that the financial service provider or the pension provider, as the case may be, has begun those proceedings in order to prevent the making of the complaint, or to frustrate or delay its investigation.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The provisions of Section 50(3)(b) are also relevant, as these prescribe that </p><p>&ldquo;<i>The Ombudsman shall not investigate or make a decision on a complaint where&hellip; there are or have been proceedings (other than where the proceedings have been stayed under Section 49) before any Court in respect of the matter that is the subject of the investigation.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Section 49 makes clear that where one of the parties to a complaint before the Ombudsman subsequently commences proceedings in any Court, then any party to those proceedings may apply to the Court for an Order to formally <i>stay</i>the proceedings. It is a matter for the Court to make an order pursuant to Section 49 if it is satisfied that:- </p><p><i>&ldquo;(i)</i><i>there is no sufficient reason why the matter in respect of which the proceedings have been commenced, should not be investigated by the Ombudsman, and</i></p><p><i>(ii) the party that commenced the proceedings was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the investigation.</i></p><p>It is also notable that pursuant to Section 52 of the FSPO Act 2017: </p><p><i>&ldquo;The Ombudsman may decline to investigate or may discontinue an investigation of, a complaint where in the opinion of the Ombudsman &hellip; the subject matter of the complaint is of such a degree of complexity that the Courts are a more appropriate forum.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The Ombudsman has informed me that these counterbalancing provisions within the governing legislation, recognise the statutory functions of the FSPO to impartially investigate complaints against financial service providers and pension providers, against the background of the overarching jurisdiction of the Courts. Together these statutory provisions ensure that any issues to be determined between a financial service provider and its customer, can be determined by one forum, being the one more suitable to the particular circumstances.</p></reply>

The volume of these declarations is very low. </p>  <p>  There are also some occasions where there is a requirement for original supporting documentation to be authenticated by Revenue as part of an import or export e.g. an original certificate of origin. In these cases, the physical document may be requested. Again however, the volumes are very low.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-03-10a.726.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021031000084#WRM05100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 303 together.</p><p>The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: </p><p>To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D. The trade must be carried on from a business premises that is located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living with Covid-19 Plan&rsquo;, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing its business premises. </p><p>To make a claim under the CRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the business in the period for which the restrictions are in operation, and for which a claim is made, will be no more than 25% of an amount equal to the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or average weekly turnover in 2020 in the case of a new business) multiplied by the number of weeks in the period for which a claim is made. </p><p>Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  To be eligible to make a claim under the CRSS, the applicable restrictions must require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.</p><p>In relation to the eligibility of hotels to claim under the CRSS, I understand the Deputy is referring to a statistic that was included in a media statement made by the Irish Hotels Federation on 11 December 2020.  At that time, public health restrictions had been eased, with a phased move to a revised Level 3 restrictions applying nationally, which meant that hotels were allowed to reopen to provide accommodation services to the general public.  Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools, including those within hotels, were also allowed to reopen for individual use.  Where, on the relaxation of restrictions, a hotel ceased to be substantially restricted, and therefore ceased to be eligible to claim under the CRSS, it could claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under the scheme (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist it with the costs of reopening at that time.</p><p>Since 24 December 2020 hotels have, under public health regulations, been required to close to the public (other than for guests who had a booking and were due to check in up to and including 26 December 2020), with limited opening allowed only for essential non-social and non-tourist purposes.  Therefore, hotels are currently eligible to make a claim under the CRSS because public health restrictions are in place which require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises.  </p><p>In relation to eligibility criteria and increasing the rates of the scheme, I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS or to increase the rates. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.  </p><p>The legislation provides that the Scheme will run to 31 March 2021 but may be extended by Ministerial Order (subject to D&aacute;il approval) but not later than 31 December 2021.  </p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to supports and, as Deputies will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 23 February, it has been decided that both the EWSS and the CRSS are now to be extended until the end of June 2021. </p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy.  It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of the second quarter of 2021.</p><p>Consideration is being given to the fact that continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.</p></reply>

The report was sent to Government and published in December 2019. </p>  <p>  The report contained 15 recommendations, grouped under the following subject areas:</p>  <p>  - Leveraging role of state supports for SMEs infrastructure to address market gaps;</p>  <p>  - Reducing financial exclusions and managing of existing information by credit unions, An Post and local authorities;</p>  <p>  - Enhancing competition;</p>  <p>  - Reducing information asymmetries and building skills; and</p>  <p>  - Enhanced responsibility for commercial banks.</p>  <p>  These recommendations are listed below and were a matter for a range of Departments and Agencies.  The Deputy should note that Recommendations 9 and 11 matters for my Department.  Following publication, I circulated the report directly to the relevant Ministers and Agencies and asked them to consider the recommendations relevant to their organisation.  Any subsequent implementation would be a matter for said Departments and Agencies, based on their own considerations and who will be able to supply further information if required by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 1: &ldquo;Continue to target rural enterprise support in future counter-guarantee loan schemes.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) operates a number of schemes on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest loan guarantee scheme in the history of the State. The Scheme provides &euro;2 billion in lending, for terms up to five-and-a-half years and offers a range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million at below market interest rates and is available to SMEs and small mid-caps (business with less than 500 employees). The scheme, which was developed under European Commission&rsquo;s Temporary State-Aid Framework enabled the inclusion of primary producers. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;800m in lending available to SMEs and small mid-caps. Like the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme is available to businesses engaged in primary agriculture and aquaculture (the farming and seafood sectors), supporting businesses in these sectors as they seek financing for long-term investment. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 2: &ldquo;Expand Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s mandate to provide enterprise loans of up to &euro;50,000.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  </p>  <p>  With the arrival of COVID-19 in Ireland and the subsequent impact on businesses across the country, as an emergency measure Microfinance Ireland introduced the COVID-19 Loan Scheme to provide support to microenterprises directly impacted by the effects of the virus.  Phase 1 of the scheme had significant demand with the equivalent of three years lending provided in a four-month period. Phase 2 of the scheme commenced in August 2020 and MFI customers can apply for a COVID-19 Business Loan up to &euro;25,000 in addition to their existing borrowings, subject to a maximum credit exposure of &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  The Department Enterprise, Trade and Employment has assured me that it will continue to work with MFI to provide appropriate loans to microenterprises.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 3: &ldquo;Promotion by Local Enterprise Offices of Micro Enterprise Loan Fund.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Offices are bodies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the LEOs actively work with MicroFinance Ireland to promote their loan fund. The LEOs submitted 751 loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland in 2020.The LEOs have a provisional target to submit 550 loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland in 2021.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 4: &ldquo;Set ambitious targets for regional impact of any revised Brexit loan scheme.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that while there are currently no regional targets for the Brexit Loan Scheme, analysis of applications indicates a good geographical spread of beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that work is under way to scope potential options for adjustments/revisions to the Brexit Loan Scheme, however given the structure of the scheme, which is counter-guaranteed by the European Investment Fund through its InnovFin SME guarantee facility, there may be limitations on the extent of any alterations to the scheme. </p>  <p>  Any revised Brexit Loan Scheme will be promoted across the regions.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 5: &ldquo;Consider new initiatives to support expansion of SME lending by newer platforms.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) significantly expanded the number of on-lenders offering SBCI products over the course of 2020.  The participation of non-bank credit providers (3 signed, 3 to sign in near future) and the inclusion of 19 Credit unions in the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee scheme (CCGS) has significantly broadened the access to guarantee schemes both by type of institution and by geographic spread, and has increased access to the target audience considerably.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of non-bank finance providers has allowed SBCI products be delivered via new lending platforms and has brought competition and choice to the market.</p>  <p>  SBCI also increased the number of on-lenders participating in delivering the Future Growth loan Scheme (FGLS) by two, increasing the number to six participating institutions. SBCI also has a permanent open call on its website for interested on-lenders to apply for liquidity facilities to help increase price competition and customer choice.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 6: &ldquo;Expansion of Personal Micro Credit Scheme by member-owned credit unions.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  This is a policy matter for the Minister for Social Protection.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Personal Micro Credit Scheme (PMC) provides for small scale loans, known as "It Makes Sense" loans, ranging from &euro;100 to &euro;2,000, by Credit Unions to borrowers in receipt of social welfare payments who may have difficulty accessing low cost credit. Currently 107 credit unions at some 281 locations are participating in the Scheme. </p>  <p>  An Post facilitates the repayment of these loans for social welfare recipients who receive their payment through a Post Office, by utilising the Department of Social Protection's Household Budgeting Facility. As part of a pilot scheme since Q1 2020, the Department of Social Protection has funded the weekly administrative cost for access to the Household Budgeting Facility.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 7: &ldquo;Facilitation of new providers to enhance access to credit in communities.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  This recommendation focusses on potential for the An Post or other community-based providers to increase access to credit. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to the provision of financial services specifically by the post office network relates primarily to payment services, for which I as the Minister for Finance authorise An Post to provide. This authorisation is under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 (Section 67) Order 2016. </p>  <p>  For all other matters related to the post office network, I defer to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communication, Mr Eamon Ryan, TD. An Post is a body under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p>  <p>  I understand from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.</p>  <p>  Initiatives by the SBCI are outlined above under Recommendation 5.  SBCI is currently exploring a number of new initiatives in partnership with both existing and new on-lenders that will further increase the level of competition and choice in the market, particularly in relation to emerging opportunities associated with the Green agenda and energy efficiency.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 8: &ldquo;Development of initiatives by local authorities as part of digital strategies to assist individuals to apply online for banking services.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Policy on local authorities is the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 9: &ldquo;Support the Credit Union Market to deliver Expanded Range of Community Banking Services.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Credit Union policy is a responsibility under my Department.  Revised Central Bank lending regulations were enacted on 1 January 2020 which materially expanded the lending capacity of the sector, including for mortgage and SME lending. The sector had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of &euro;344 million at end 2020. More recently, I welcomed the announcement that nineteen credit unions have been approved to participate in the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS).</p>  <p>  The Government is supportive of credit unions who have the financial strength, the competence and the capability, undertaking more SME and mortgage lending. However, the decision to lend is to be made by the board of each individual credit union, taking into account their own specific commercial, risk appetite and regulatory factors.  </p>  <p>  I am also aware that many credit unions have improved their digital offerings.  In 2016, the Central Bank defined and described a suite of additional services known as MPCAS, under which approved credit unions may offer personal current accounts with debit cards, overdrafts and a wide range of payment services within an appropriate risk framework. To date, 54 credit unions have been approved to provide MPCAS.</p>  <p>  I am also aware of a number of collaborative projects underway to support finance for retro-fitting and agri-lending, as well as collaborative projects being developed in the areas of SME lending, insurance and investment in social housing. These are all positive examples of how many credit unions are widening their products and services for their members. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Government has committed to a review of the policy framework for credit unions in the Programme for Government. This project is already well advanced.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 10: &ldquo;An Post to explore and discuss with its parent Government Department, NewEra, and, where appropriate, the Department of Finance, the possibility of investing in partner financial organisations, where such investment is commercially viable and where it would enhance competition in lending market.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Please see information provided on Recommendation 7.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 11: &ldquo;Extend Exemption for New Community Banking Entrants from Notification of Charges for 5 Years.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  This recommendation is still under consideration by officials in my Department.  Indecon accepted that the current 3 year exemption is not a major barrier.  The extent of any additional attraction for new community banking entrants is limited and has to be balanced against the potential impact on consumers dealing with such new entrants.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 12: &ldquo;Development of Technology Based Lending Tool Kit by Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Please see information provided on Recommendation 13.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 13: &ldquo;Advisory supports by Local Enterprise Offices to include assistance with preparation of lending applications.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices are bodies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that The LEOs offer financial mentoring which helps firms with the preparation of lending applications. The LEOs also offer financial training which upskills small business owners and managers to be in a position to prepare their own loan applications.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 14: &ldquo;Skillnet Ireland to offer analysis of lending requirements as a component in their Management Development Programmes.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Skillnet Ireland is a State agency under the aegis of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 15: "Commercial Banks should consider the establishment of an increased number of Community Banking Hubs or provide alternative methods of banking services delivery in areas where branch closures may have hindered access to banks.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  This recommendation is a matter for the commercial banks and the Deputy will be aware that decisions in regards to operational matters are the sole responsibility of the boards and management of the individual banks which are run on an independent and commercial basis. Furthermore, the independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks are publicly available and were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  However, I am advised that the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) states that a bank must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. The Central Bank adopts a &lsquo;technology neutral&rsquo; approach meaning that the same principles of regulation, including the rules of the Code, apply equally to both digital and traditional delivery environments.</p>  <p>  Branch closures are always a matter of regret, and I as Minister, would hope that closures are kept to the minimum necessary for financial sustainability. Where there are branch closures, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code must be complied with.  Requirements include immediate notification to the Central Bank, at least two months notice to affected consumers and either ensuring all branch business is properly completed prior to closure or informing as to how continuity of service will be provided.  Notwithstanding this, I do expect that any bank closing branches will do everything it can to mitigate the impacts of the branch closures on local communities, including technology and the use of alternative means of service delivery.  In this regard, I note Bank of Ireland has agreed a new partnership with An Post which will allow personal and business customers use their local post office for a range of banking services &ndash; including to withdraw cash and make cash and cheque lodgements &ndash; at no additional cost.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>Borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The BPFI reported, that as of 31 December 2020, approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% were receiving other supports from lenders.</p><p>As Minister for Finance I have no function in the commercial decisions made by banks. However, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review  was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. </p></reply>

The tax liabilities that may be deferred or &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; are VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments due to be refunded to Revenue by employers, and certain self-assessed income tax liabilities.  </p>  <p>  In the case of VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities, Period 1 refers to the period when a business has been unable to trade due to the Covid-19 related restrictions and includes the first full two monthly VAT period after the business resumes trading.  For example, if a business has been closed due to Covid-19 restrictions but resumes trading in April 2021, it will be able to warehouse liabilities accrued from March 2020 up to the end of June 2021.</p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that where a business re-opened but has had to close again due to the re-imposition of restrictions, the trade is deemed to be still subject to the restrictions provided for in the regulations under sections 5 and 31A Health Act 1947 until it has re-opened again.  This means that VAT, PAYE (Employer) and excess TWSS liabilities for such businesses can continue to be warehoused in respect of the extended restricted period.  </p>  <p>  Following the expiration of Period 1, businesses are afforded a further 12 months (&ldquo;Period 2&rdquo;) during which collection of warehoused liabilities will be deferred.</p>  <p>  No interest will be charged on outstanding Covid-19 liabilities in either Period 1 or Period 2.  In cases where businesses have been subject to re-imposition of restrictions intermittently since March 2020, the earliest liabilities warehoused (Jan/Feb VAT and Feb PAYE) have already been warehoused at 0% interest for almost 12 months.  Where such businesses do not resume trading until April 2021, these liabilities may be warehoused at 0% interest for a period of 28 months in total (from March 2020 until June 2022). Interest on warehoused liabilities is charged thereafter at c. 3% per annum until the liabilities are paid in full (this is &ldquo;Period 3&rdquo; of the warehousing scheme).</p>  <p>  Legislation underpinning the warehousing of VAT, PAYE (Employer) liabilities and overpayments of TWSS provides that Period 2 may be extended by Ministerial order but cannot extend beyond 31 December 2022.   This is to ensure compliance with EU State Aid rules, provided for under the EU Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

As the letter highlights, using GDP as a comparative measure of the size of the Irish economy internationally is not representative as it does not accurately reflect what is going on in the domestic economy, given the size of our multinational sector.  For this reason, modified Gross National Income (or GNI*), which excludes some of the statistical distortions arising from the multinational sector, enables a more meaningful measure of the size of the Irish economy. The letter also uses Actual Individual Consumption, which refers to all goods and services actually consumed by households. While this indicator is a useful guide for economic welfare, international comparisons can be challenging because of the difficulties in comparing the quality of different countries goods and services as well as differing savings rates among countries. </p>  <p>  Professor Honohan&rsquo;s letter indicates that if we use GDP per capita in 2019, Ireland was ranked in second place in the EU, behind only Luxembourg. However, If we use GNI* per capita, Ireland instead was found to rank in eighth place or inside the top third of EU countries. When using Actual Individual Consumption per capita, Ireland was ranked in twelfth place in the EU in 2019 but remains in the top half of EU countries.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the letter in its conclusion acknowledges that Ireland is a prosperous country but that a range of measures of economic wellbeing should be considered. I wish to assure the Deputy that when assessing the position of the economy, my Department examines a wide range of economic indicators and the government will continue to pursue sensible policies aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and the well-being of all our citizens.</p></reply>

Without a global solution, we will see unilateral and regional measures continue to proliferate, with consequent negative impacts on trade at a time when the need for stability in such matters is essential and a return to economic growth is paramount to assist recovery post-pandemic.</p>  <p>  Ireland has seen the benefits of international cooperation and it is my belief that working together within the multilateral framework offered by the OECD is the only way to ensure a stable international tax system into the future.</p></reply>

Kenmare is being implemented as part of the first tranche of 60 new schemes that have been prioritised for implementation nationally as part of the Flood Relief Management Plans.</p>  <p>  In October 2020 Kerry County Council issued a request for tenders for engineering design consultants and environmental consultants to the Office of Public Works&rsquo; framework of consultants. Three tender submissions were received and these submissions are currently being evaluated.  It is expected to appoint a consultant in the coming weeks.  The appointed consultant will be tasked with identifying and designing a flood relief scheme to alleviate the risk of flooding to Kenmare to a determined standard of protection and to procure, manage and oversee the construction of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In advance of the larger Kenmare Flood Relief Scheme, interim works are currently being carried out.  These works involve the clearance of vegetation (primarily overhanging tree branches) and debris along a stretch of the Keelnagower river which pose an immediate risk in a flood event as they may contribute to blockages of bridges as was seen in the recent flooding event in Kenmare, where a number of properties were flooded. The clearance of this vegetation will also allow for various surveys to take place (site investigations, environmental baseline etc.).  An Environmental Screening was carried out to ensure that there would be no adverse environmental effects and the appropriate state agencies were consulted with regards to the works. These works are substantially complete.</p>  <p>  A Coastal Wave and Water Level Study is due to commence in the coming weeks which will allow for the analysis of wave-overtopping and will form part of the overall flood relief scheme for Kenmare.</p></reply>

This scheme builds on the successful outcomes of the pilot Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians and the valuable insights gained. This new scheme is aimed at commercial venues, producers and promoters in the culture sector and will support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and continued high quality artistic output for the general public. Grant recipients of the pilot LPSS may apply under this new scheme. The scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and will be managed directly by my Department. The Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 will be open for applications on 19th March 2021 and further information can be found on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;5 million will also be made available to local authorities for outdoor live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers. Performances can be recorded or streamed if health restrictions prevent live events.  Local authorities will be encouraged to engage events companies to develop and deliver a programme of performances.  </p>  <p>  As a further support measure for those in the live entertainment industry, an allocation of &euro;14m will be made available for a new scheme to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) will see support offered by way of two levels of flat payments:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;100,000;</p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  Self-employed businesses whether sole traders, partnerships and incorporated entities operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. The scheme will open when the necessary administrative and IT systems are in place.</p>  <p>  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector. This will be applied to supporting the installation of high quality recording and streaming facilities in venues through a competitive grant application process. </p>  <p>  Up to &euro;1 million has been allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming to support the employment of performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff. With gatherings still restricted, SPF 2021 has curated a rich and dynamic programme of events involving hundreds of artists, musicians, performers, creators, and community organisations that will be broadcast on the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Festival TV online channel over six days and nights, marking the national day. </p></reply>

There are two streams of funding allocated by Sport Ireland which are central to the delivery of the organisation's programme including High Performance Programme Funding and the International Carding Scheme.</p>  <p>  High Performance Programme Funding is provided to support a range of activities including salaries, training camps and competitions at junior and senior level, pathway development, and performance services. In 2020, the organisation received &euro;440,000 in High Performance Programme Funding.</p>  <p>  The International Carding Scheme provides financial support to athletes for their training and competition programmes. The primary purpose of this funding is to support Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European, World, Olympic and Paralympic level. </p>  <p>  The International Carding Scheme is criteria based requiring athletes to achieve standards set forth by their NGB in agreement with Sport Ireland. These standards are based on performances achieved at international competitions. Athletes are considered and approved for funding by Sport Ireland based on applications received from the organisation. As part of the International Carding Scheme Sport Ireland allocated &euro;426,000 to the organisation, which was made up of &euro;224,000 for their Olympic Programme and &euro;202,000 for their Paralympic Programme.</p>  <p>  Further to those listed on the International Carding Scheme, Sport Ireland recognises that there will be other athletes who will require support from the NGB, specifically those who are tracking to compete in Paris 2024. Sport Ireland has recently engaged with the organisation who have confirmed their intention to establish an alternative mechanism of support for these athletes which may include service provision, training camp and competition exposure, or direct athlete funding through alternative resources. The organisation will be responsible for developing this mechanism of support recognising it must be sport specific and reflective of the capacity within the NGB. </p>  <p>  In 2021 the organisation is projecting an expenditure of &euro;583,500 on International Competitions, Training Camps and Support Services for all athletes (Senior, Junior, Youth &amp;amp; U23). It is proposed to allocate 2/3 of this support to Senior Athletes with 1/3 allocated to Junior, Youth &amp;amp; U23. This is broadly consistent with what was planned for 2020 notwithstanding the disruption caused by COVID-19.</p></reply>

To date, 5 athletes have achieved automatic quota places for the Paralympic Games through World Championship performances. Further qualification will be secured through ranking results and slots awarded by the International Paralympic Committee to Ireland. It is anticipated that the final team size will be between 25-30 athletes. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, including high performance sport and its funding allocations. It provides a range of supports to Paralympics Ireland to support their high performance programmes and athletes. Specifically, in respect of athlete support, the Sport Ireland International Carding Scheme provides financial assistance to athletes for their training and competition programmes. The primary purpose of this funding is to support Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European, World, Olympic and Paralympic level. The International Carding Scheme is criteria based requiring athletes to achieve standards set forth by their NGB, in agreement with Sport Ireland. </p>  <p>  In 2021, Sport Ireland will provide &euro;620,000 in direct athlete supports to para athletes in a range of sports through the International Carding Scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition Sport Ireland (through the Sport Ireland Institute) will also provide other non-financial supports in the following areas:</p>  <p>  - Sport Ireland Institute &amp;amp; Paralympics Ireland have extended their Games support partnership to cover the postponed Games. This has confirmed the appointment of five specific Institute practitioners to the Irish Paralympic Team covering S&amp;C, Nutrition, Physiology, Transition support and Performance Analysis.</p>  <p>  - Sport Ireland are currently working with Paralympics Ireland to identify and resource a further addition to their medical staff for the Games arising from the extensive COVID-19 protocols in place. </p>  <p>  - 301 direct support days to Para sports was provided by the Sport Ireland Institute Team in 2020 representing 13.87% of the total resource.</p></reply>

It provides funding to Paralympics Ireland to support its administration and operational costs. Sport Ireland also provides High Performance Programme funding to Paralympics Ireland to support the delivery of its para programme, which supports Irish athletes in reaching finals and achieving medals at European Championships, World Championships, and the Paralympic Games. </p><p>In addition to the annual funding allocations, Sport Ireland has provided Paralympics Ireland with a package of funding for the Paralympic Games throughout the Tokyo cycle.  Due to Covid-19 it is reasonable to anticipate that further costs will arise for Paralympic Ireland in 2021 recognising that additional protective measures are required for Team Ireland. These costs relate to the necessity for single room occupancy, private transportation, additional Covid-19 officers, and a PCR testing programme. In this regard, Sport Ireland will run an extensive funding process for high performance sport in 2021. This process will determine the immediate and confirmed costs to Paralympics Ireland, which are reasonable and beyond the funding previously provided to address Games costs. This commitment for further funding has been formally communicated to Paralympics Ireland</p><p>To enhance the capacity and capability of high performance programmes, Sport Ireland encourages National Governing Bodies including Paralympics Ireland to establish robust business plans which are underpinned by stable and diverse income streams. Paralympics Ireland have a clear target for sponsorship and fundraising income in 2021, which will supplement funding received through Sport Ireland. </p><p>Throughout the Tokyo cycle 2017-2020, and in year 1 of the Paris cycle which coincides with the rescheduled Paralympic Games 2021, Sport Ireland has provided &euro;7,722,500 in funding to Paralympics Ireland.

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.  The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers.</p>  <p>  The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. </p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions. The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media, over the next 10 years. </p>  <p>  In terms of specific supports for the sector, the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. </p>  <p>Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meetings with key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ). Most recently I met with Local Ireland on Wednesday 17th February. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues facing the sector. </p></reply>

I am familiar with the report on gender disparity on Irish radio and I recently met with the producers of the report. My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to further explore appropriate approaches to the issues raised in the report. </p>  <p>  The Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out the statutory framework for the regulation of sound broadcasting services. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the independent regulator for sound broadcasting content in the State. Commercial radio stations are subject to contractual obligations, including public service commitments with the BAI, which are agreed upon during the licensing process. Compliance with such obligations is monitored by the BAI.</p>  <p>  The BAI have undertaken a number of positive actions in relation to gender balance on our broadcasting services. In 2018, BAI produced a Gender Action Plan aimed at promoting gender equality in the Irish audiovisual sector though its key pillars: data collection and publication, research, encouraging gender initiatives and accountability. Under BAI&rsquo;s Sound &amp;amp; Vision Funding Scheme, the assessment of applications has included consideration of the number of women in key creative roles, as a measure to support greater gender equality in the industry. This information is then used as an assessment criterion as part of the BAI&rsquo;s assessment process. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion. The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation. I am aware that submissions have been made to the consultation by Women on Air, an advocacy group for the representation of women on broadcasting media, and by the Equality Expert Group, a new collective of experts drawn from a variety of fields, public and private, seeking to support equality and diversity in Irish social, economic and cultural life. </p></reply>

Together with the T&aacute;naiste, I jointly chair a Hospitality and Tourism Forum which allows us both to monitor developments in these sectors. </p>  <p>  The challenges facing tourism as a result of the pandemic are hugely significant. All tourism activity is affected when businesses cannot open and people cannot travel due to the necessary public health measures introduced. In Ireland, the impact is even greater due to the fact that we are heavily reliant on inbound overseas tourism for approximately three-quarters of all revenue generated and this sector is even more adversely affected by the pandemic.</p>  <p>A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed last May to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which includes a set of recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020&ndash;2023 to me on September 30th last. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic. This Plan has been a very useful input for me as I have considered, along with my Government colleagues, measures to help the tourism sector to survive the effects of the pandemic and, in time, to recover. The Plan has informed many of the measures we have introduced.</p>  <p>  In December, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of the Recovery Plan and monitor the recovery of the tourism sector. This Group reported to me for the first time last month and I brought this report to the attention of my colleagues in Cabinet. This report welcomed progress made to date and set out a number of areas on which the Oversight Group believes the Government should focus.</p>  <p>  I will continue to use the Tourism Recovery Plan and the outputs from the Recovery Oversight Group to inform my thinking as the situation evolves. Overall, a recovery in tourism activity will serve to help all of those businesses which depend on tourism to generate revenue.</p></reply>

The extension of the transitional period originally prescribed by Section 38(b) of the 2009 Act (3 years) by the aforementioned 2011 Act (extending the period to 12 years) relates simply to the period when a claim to a prescriptive right can be made by reliance on the 'old' law replaced by the 2009 Act.  From 2021, reliance must be made on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act; in particular, reliance must be made on the new single and shorter period of 12 years.  There is no question of a cut-off point occurring in 2021 when a claim to a prescriptive right can no longer be made.  All that changes in 2021 is the basis on which the prescriptive right can be claimed.</p><p>2.  The new procedure for registration of a prescriptive right introduced by Section 41 of the 2011 Act is not subject to a time limit.  It is a permanent procedure and, in particular, does not cease to be available in 2021.  The only change which occurs in 2021 is the basis on which an application must be made to the PRA.  As pointed out in (1) above, from 2021, the application will have to be grounded on the 'new' law introduced by the 2009 Act and reliance on the 'old' law repealed by that Act will cease to be possible.</p><p>This procedure is only for easements (including rights of way) acquired by prescription.  If all parties agree to the registration of an easement, an application should be made by lodging the appropriate Deed of Grant.</p><p>Finally, a Practice Direction is available on the PRA&rsquo;s website (<i>www.prai.ie</i>) that covers the process relating to the registration of prescriptive easements. </p></reply>

It extends the delivery of Housing First nationally, with the introduction of targets for each local authority. The Plan includes an overall target of 663 tenancies in the period 2018-2021. The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Health, the HSE and the local authorities.  </p>  <p>  In line with the National Implementation Plan, Housing First is being delivered on a regional basis by the local authorities and the HSE. Contracts for the delivery of services have been put in place in each of the nine regions responsible for the delivery of homeless services with tenancies now in place in every region. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2020, a total of 508 individuals were being housed under the Housing First programme including 392 individuals who have been housed since the publication of the National Implementation Plan. I look forward to the targets outlined in the National Implementation Plan being reached by the end of this year.  I wrote to each local authority on 26 February to recognise the progress made on Housing First to date, to stress the importance that that national targets are met, and to confirm that the expansion of the programme from 2022 for the years ahead will be announced later this year.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the further expansion of Housing First.  Research is currently being undertaken by the Housing Agency to carry out an assessment of need for the supports provided by Housing First.

This has been a complex and challenging process for key stakeholders, notably the workers, who include approximately 3,200 local authority water services staff who are subject to service level agreement arrangements with Irish Water as well as a smaller number of staff employed directly by Irish Water and Ervia, together with their trade union representatives, the local government sector, and Ervia/Irish Water.</p><p>In keeping with the Programme for Government commitment, the Government recently approved a Policy Paper entitled Irish Water - Towards a national, publicly-owned, regulated water services utility which is now available on my Department's website at <i></i>. The Policy Paper sets out the Government's expectations and views in relation to the next phase of the Water Sector Transformation Programme, including those matters raised in the questions. </p><p>By setting out its views and expectations in this way, the Government is enabling stakeholders to engage meaningfully in the change process which will give them the strongest possible say in determining their own future working arrangements.  I have written to the Workplace Relations Commission on 3 March 2021 asking them to contact the parties to arrange to re-commence engagement on a Framework for the future delivery of water services.  The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b></b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

My Department has been engaging with the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) in relation to the registration of Architectural Technologists.  In this regard, CIAT has identified that its preferred route is to set up a stand-alone register for Architectural Technologists. As such, it is now a matter for CIAT to set up a register on an administrative basis in keeping with registers already in place for other professional groupings under the Building Control Act 2007 and in consultation with the relevant industry stakeholders.  CIAT have been advised that the register should be in place for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate that it operates effectively in accordance with the provisions of the Act. </p>  <p>  Following this process, my Department will review the register and subject to this review, will then consider bringing forward legislative proposals to place it on a statutory basis.  CIAT have been advised of the process required to publish primary legislation. </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers.</p></reply>

As these 8 sites are currently at the pre-planning stage, the exact delivery potential for each site will only be finalised as final plans are put in place and planning permission is sought. The LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, on the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes.</p>  <p>  In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a further site in Shanganagh. Approximately 34% of the units will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. </p></reply>

In general, rent reviews take place 3 years from the commencement date of the lease and every 3 years thereafter, with reference to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.</p><p>The average annual cost of Part V leases set out in Table 4 is based on the average full year cost of the Part V lease agreements entered into by the relevant local authority in that year and does not necessarily represent the amount claimed or paid in respect of that period.  In a Part V leased unit, the lease payment can vary depending on how the equivalent net monetary value has been reflected in the agreement. This is usually achieved by either a rent free period up front or a discount on the lease payment over the term of the lease (or part thereof). Where a rent free period is negotiated in respect of Part V units, no amount will be claimed or paid in respect of the units for that period.</p></reply>

Allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021, the CREL scheme will see the Government issue 40-year loans to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to cover up to 30% of the capital cost of new homes for Cost Rental. These loans have 1% simple interest, fixed for the lifetime of the loan, and no repayment is required until the end of the loan term, at which point both the principal and the accrued interest will fall due. </p>  <p>  Whilst AHBs may invest their own equity, it is anticipated the majority of remaining capital costs will be primarily sourced from long-term commercial debt funding. To this end, the Housing Finance Agency has made available &euro;100m in 40-year loans for CREL-approved projects in 2021, competitively priced at 1.25% interest fixed for the first 30 years.</p>  <p>  Following a Call for Proposals and a rigorous assessment process, approval in principle was granted to Cl&uacute;id, Respond, and Tuath AHBs for CREL funding of 390 new Cost Rental homes in 2021. Precise details of the funded projects, including locations, housing typologies, and cost-covering rents, will be released when the AHBs have completed the financial and commercial arrangements.</p></reply>

All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply. Responsibility for enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority. </p><p>Local authorities have a strong legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Under Section 34 of that Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, any person who fails to comply with an improvement notice or re-lets a house in breach of a prohibition notice, will be guilty of an offence and will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.</p><p>Part IV of the Housing Act 1966 deals with overcrowding and establishes effective limits on the numbers of people that can occupy the same bedroom.  The Act requires, inter alia, that there is at least 400 cubic feet of free air space for each person in a bedroom. Local Authorities are responsible for the enforcement of this legislation. </p><p>Under the Act, a housing authority may request information from the owner or occupier of a house such as will allow that authority to determine if a house can be deemed to be overcrowded, having regard to section 63 of the Act. </p><p>Under the Act, a local authority can prohibit the use of an overcrowded dwelling, irrespective of whether it is being let or not, and can serve notice on the owner of a dwelling specifying the maximum number of persons that may occupy it without causing overcrowding.  If the owner of a house is causing or permitting the house to be overcrowded, the authority can require the owner to desist from this within a period not exceeding 21 days. Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with these requirements is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 and/or to imprisonment for up to one month.</p><p>Overcrowding may give rise to concerns in respect of fire safety, and may lead to enforcement action by fire authorities.</p><p>I am committed to empowering local authorities to deal with overcrowding more effectively. </p><p>My Department is currently working on proposed legislative changes to the Housing Act 1966 which are designed to strengthen the statutory framework for the enforcement of the Act's overcrowding provisions.</p></reply>

The planning system facilitates the regulation of such short-term letting uses undertaken by the individual carrying out the activity, i.e. the owner/occupier of the house or apartment, rather than the online platforms advertising such properties. </p>  <p>  The provisions do not generally affect the operation of purpose built student accommodation, for which permissions are typically granted with planning conditions that generally facilitates the use of student accommodation complexes as alternative summer or holiday accommodation but which are reserved as student housing during the academic year. This is on foot of advice provided by my Department to planning authorities, by way of Circular Letter PL8/2016 issued in July 2016, regarding matters to consider in relation to the handling of planning applications for student accommodation. In this regard, the Circular makes it clear that housing for students is a specific and important segment of the overall housing sector with distinct characteristics and requirements. Accordingly, appropriate safeguards are required to ensure that student accommodation is not used as permanent residential accommodation or for other uses and is restricted to the accommodation of students during the academic year. </p>  <p>  However, planning authorities were reminded of the need to establish a steady rental income for such student accommodation developments throughout the year in order to ensure the deliverability and viability of student accommodation development projects from a funding perspective and to recognise that such complexes can also play an important role in providing affordable accommodation for tourists and visitors in major urban areas during the peak summer demand periods.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities. Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services. The Framework was developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.  In general, the operation of these emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework. This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the NQSF arrangements. Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p></reply>

Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 218 fire stations nationwide.</p><p>Over the course of 2014/2015, an External Validation Group (EVG), commissioned by the Management Board of the NDFEM, visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of the &quot;Keeping Communities Safe&quot; national policy document. In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;.  The findings of that process are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>This first EVG report was a welcome benchmark of local authority provision of fire services in Ireland, and reviewed a number of themes. For the first time, it reported on the matching of provision of fire services with assessed fire risk. It reviewed fire safety work and undertook an assessment of the impact of national guidance on safety, health and welfare of staff in fire services. The Report concluded that the public are served well by the locally authority provided fire service arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. </p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process. </p><p>As an alternative, the Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. The objective was to capture  issues arising, lessons to be learned and good practice which worked during the first phase of Covid-19 response, so that essential services could continue to be maintained in case of further surges. </p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. These visits were undertaken between the 24th of June and the 22nd of September 2020.

While the Society is more than its premises, the building on Fifth Avenue is an iconic emblem of Ireland in New York and a vital part of the infrastructure that underpins US-Ireland relations. </p>  <p>  I am disappointed and concerned about the proposed sale and I have put on the record of the House my opposition to that sale. Through our Consulate in New York, I have urged the Board of the AIHS to reconsider this decision.  The building's loss would be keenly felt by the community in New York and beyond. </p>  <p>  I welcome the Statement by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence urging efforts to ensure that the building remains available to the people of New York, the US and Ireland. </p>  <p>  There have also been statements by high-profile Irish and Irish-American individuals and institutions in opposition to the sale. </p>  <p>  Our Consulate General in New York has been in contact with a range of individuals and organisations in the city about this issue.  From these discussions, their assessment is that there is sufficient support among the community for the Society to remain in its current iconic location and to thrive, subject to the right structures being put in place.   The Consulate is also maintaining ongoing contact with the President of the AIHS on the situation.</p>  <p>   I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s question and the correspondence supplied as further evidence of the value and importance the building and the Society play in US-Ireland relations and the desire for the building to remain available to the Irish community of New York and beyond.  Keeping the premises on Fifth Avenue available could benefit a huge range of Irish organisations, including Higher Education Institutions and their alumni in the US. </p>  <p>  The matter of naming the building or other such changes would, of course, be a matter for decision by the Board of the Society at the right time.</p>  <p>  We remain ready to engage in finding a constructive solution that meets the needs of the community and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

However we remain concerned regarding civil liberties and in particular the ongoing detention of a number of women&rsquo;s rights defenders. Ireland has raised our concerns on these issues bilaterally with the Saudi authorities.</p>  <p>  Ireland also raises these issues in international fora. At the most recent Human Rights Council in February, Ireland co-signed a Joint Statement which expressed concern at the continued restrictions on political and civil rights in Saudi Arabia. </p>  <p>  We welcome that plans are advancing to establish an EU-Saudi Arabia Human Rights Dialogue.

We continue to see the daily harassment and intimidation of civil society, journalists and independent media, unjust detentions and apparent attempts to criminalise human rights work. The repression of the Belarusian people, who are peacefully and courageously defending their democratic and human rights, is totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  As is well known, a concern for human rights is at the core of Ireland's international engagement. We have been very clear that the violations of human rights in Belarus must end immediately. Allegations of such violations need to be independently, transparently and credibly investigated and all those unjustly detained, including political prisoners, must be released. These are fundamental principles for us and this is what we and the EU have communicated during the latest session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.</p>  <p>  We continue to support civil society in Belarus along with our EU partners, while pressing the Belarusian authorities to adhere to their international obligations and commitments. One such measure is through the imposition of targeted sanctions. There have now been three tranches of EU sanctions imposed against individuals responsible for the ongoing repression of the Belarusian people and businesses which benefit from or support the regime. Ireland is open to further restrictive measures and we have communicated this to our EU colleagues. </p>  <p>  I can assure you that Ireland will keep the situation high on the international agenda and do what we can to bring about a peaceful, inclusive and democratic resolution to the current crisis.</p></reply>

The EU introduced restrictive measures on Venezuela in November 2017, and in November 2020, and the measures were further extended until 14 November 2021.  </p>  <p>  On 22 February 2021, 19 additional individuals were added to the EU restrictive measures list, bringing the total number of listings to 55. The individuals were listed due to their role in acts and decisions undermining democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, or because of serious human rights violations. The measures are targeted and designed not to have adverse humanitarian effects or otherwise unintended consequences for the people of Venezuela. Ireland supports the imposition of these targeted measures in light of the worsening crisis in Venezuela. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the EU Council Conclusions of 25 January 2021 which stated that the legislative elections held in Venezuela on 6 December 2020 could not be considered credible, inclusive or transparent, and reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to supporting a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution to the crisis.  </p>  <p>  I remain deeply concerned by the serious and deteriorating situation in Venezuela. The different elements of this crisis are inextricably linked and continue to have a grave impact on the people of Venezuela. I was troubled by the September 2020 report of the Independent Fact-Finding Mission to the UN Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Venezuela. The 46th Session of the Human Rights Council will today, 10 March, hear an oral update on the Fact-Finding Mission. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation in the country. The mass migration that has occurred as a result of the crisis is also severely impacting on neighbouring countries. In 2021, it is estimated that the total number of people to leave Venezuela since the beginning of the crisis could rise to 7 million. </p>  <p>  In October, the EU expanded its Guidance Note on how COVID-19-related humanitarian aid could be provided to countries that are subject to EU restrictive measures to include a chapter on Venezuela. The Note gives practical guidance on how to comply with EU sanctions when providing humanitarian aid, in particular medical assistance to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This ensures that humanitarian operators have the reassurance they need to deliver assistance to Venezuela during this unprecedented time. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.  Since 2019, we have provided almost &euro;2.5 million  in funding to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), as well as to NGOs responding to the needs of migrants and refugees from Venezuela.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to support efforts to overcome the crisis which can only be resolved through a negotiated and peaceful process that fully involves and is owned by the people of Venezuela. </p></reply>

As is the case with all other students in Ireland, their higher education experience has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with classes, seminars and other group activities having moved on line.  The Ireland Fellows Programme is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Irish Council for International Students (ICOS).

It provides the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation in the decade ahead and represents a step change in our approach, bringing together our development cooperation and diplomacy for optimum impact. </p><p>  In the two years since the policy was launched, there has been notable progress in delivering and advancing various aspects of A Better World including on strategy development, policy influence, whole of government initiatives, and new programme funding commitments, the latter facilitated by a &euro;30 million increase in the allocation for Official Development Aid for this year.</p><p>  Clear deliverables achieved include the publication of Ireland&rsquo;s first ever Small Island Developing States (SIDS) strategy; the launch of the Third National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; the creation of an Irish Trust Fund in the Asian Development Bank for support to disaster and climate resilience in member SIDS; and the launch of a Domestic Resource Mobilisation Initiative, in partnership with the Department of Finance and Revenue Commissioners. </p><p>A new Climate Unit has been established within the Development Cooperation and Africa Division of my Department - the Division which leads on the Irish Aid programme.  This Unit is taking forward the Programme for Government commitment to double the proportion of Official Development Aid which tackles climate change.  Last week I launched Ireland's Climate Finance Report for 2019, which set the baseline for that commitment.</p><p>While COVID-19 rolls back development gains around the world, the Irish Aid programme has proved its self well positioned to respond.  Through country programmes in Africa, Ireland is supporting the strengthening of public health systems, amplified by Irish Aid's investment this year of &euro;50 million in global public health, including COVAX which will see vaccines distributed to 90 lower and middle income countries.  Ireland is also a member of the Team Europe response to the pandemic - the EU and its Member States are already supporting the vaccination of 20% of the world's population through COVAX, and this is likely to grow.  My Department works closely with the HSE in its work on global health, including in the provision of mental health support to frontline workers in COVID-affected partner countries.</p><p>With approximately 35% of Official Development Aid generated by other Departments, coordination across Government has been strengthened over the past two years.  In addition, the capacity to manage programmes, particularly in key thematic areas such as climate, food and health, as well as oversight, is being strengthened, building from a strong base as identified by the OECD's review of Irish Aid published last year.  </p><p>Work is ongoing to increase investment in research, and improve our public engagement.  In this regard, I am currently engaged in a public consultation towards a new strategy on development education, for finalisation this summer.  </p><p>Taken together these steps will ensure that Irish Aid is fit for purpose as we implement A Better World over the next decade.</p></reply>

The Embassy&rsquo;s development programme, which has an annual indicative budget of &euro;32 million, focuses on: regional and national peace and security; democratic governance and accountability; humanitarian response and social protection; health and gender equality; and economic development.  Addis Ababa is an important hub for African regional and continental organisations, and Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy there is accredited to the African Union and the regional bloc IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), through which we engage on regional peace and security issues.</p>  <p>  The current Irish Aid programme in Ethiopia has a strong humanitarian focus, and responding to the devastating humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region is a major focus. Social protection is also a core element of the programme, through support to the flagship Productive Safety Net Programme, which provides food and cash transfers to food insecure households and highly vulnerable populations across the country. Ireland&rsquo;s programme also focuses on support for the national health system, including the delivery of maternal health programmes. Given the gendered nature of poverty, the programme strongly prioritises the needs of women and girls.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s programme in Ethiopia received a very positive assessment from the OECD 2020 DAC peer review, including for its principled political engagement on humanitarian issues, and for its strong advocacy for gender equality. The review also recognised that Ireland plays an important leadership role in terms of donor coordination in Ethiopia. We will continue to keep the development programme under close review, particularly in light of ongoing conflict in Tigray.   </p></reply>

In May of 2020, an OECD review recognised the excellence of Irish Aid, Ireland&rsquo;s international development programme, which helps Ireland play a leading role advocating for poverty reduction, channelling our assistance to where it is needed most.</p><p>Ireland has been delivering development and humanitarian assistance in Mozambique since 1996, after the country emerged from almost thirty years of civil war. Investments in development began from a very low base and today Mozambique remains one the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, with access to basic services such as water, healthcare and education still challenging. </p><p>The Embassy of Ireland in Mozambique aims to make a distinctive and principled foreign policy contribution that includes managing the delivery of the Irish Aid programme. A key objective of the programme is to improve access to quality health and education services &ndash; both critical tasks as Mozambique faces the continuing spread of COVID-19. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy is working at both political and technical levels in support of the Government of Mozambique&rsquo;s COVID-19 response. In 2020, Ireland made an advance disbursement of funding for Mozambique&rsquo;s health sector pooled fund, amounting to &euro;8 million, and worked with the Ministry of Health to reprioritise donor expenditure in order to procure PPE and to support the recruitment of auxiliary health workers to provide surge capacity in the health system. Ireland&rsquo;s support was critical in ensuring that front line staff were in place to manage the impacts of COVID-19 and that essential health services to the poor, particularly to women, children and vulnerable groups could continue. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s support to the education sector in Mozambique was also adapted in 2020 in light of COVID-19. As all schools were closed in March, Ireland worked with the Ministry of Education to reprioritise expenditure to support an adapted learning environment, including the provision of virtual classes via television and radio platforms, while also supporting teacher training and preparations for the resumption of primary and secondary education. </p><p>Reducing humanitarian need is another key element of Ireland&rsquo;s work. In March and April 2019, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused widespread devastation to infrastructure and crops, displaced 400,000 people from their homes, and left more than 2 million people in urgent humanitarian need. In response, Ireland provided just over &euro;4 million to UN and NGO partners. These funds enabled the delivery of lifesaving food assistance, health care, and access to water, sanitation and hygiene to impacted families, and later, provided those displaced with supports to return to their homes. The Embassy&rsquo;s partnerships with Government health, education, and disaster management agencies also contributed to an effective response to the outbreak of cholera following the cyclones, the rehabilitation of schools and hospitals using climate-resilient construction techniques, and to overall coordination of emergency response efforts.</p><p>In northern Mozambique, where a violent insurgency has been underway since 2017, Ireland is at the forefront of humanitarian response efforts to meet the needs of more than 660,000 people displaced from their homes by violence, and more than 950,000 facing emergency levels of food insecurity. In 2020, Ireland provided &euro;4.8 million euro to UN, NGO and Red Cross partners working to meet humanitarian needs. This included &euro;2.2 million to the World Food Programme in support of its efforts to provide emergency food assistance to those displaced, and &euro;700,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross for work to uphold humanitarian law in conflict-affected areas, to support victims of violence, and to provide those displaced with access to health services, water and sanitation.</p></reply>

Ireland has been engaged in development cooperation with South Africa since the country&rsquo;s transition to democracy in 1994, and with Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. Irish Aid programmes focus on education, maternal and child health, human rights and accountability, and tackling Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Since 2020, the Embassy and its partners have also been working to address the impacts of Covid-19. </p><p>Gender equality is at the centre of the full range of the Embassy&rsquo;s work. Addressing harmful gender norms, violence, and promoting women&rsquo;s participation in society are core elements of Irish Aid&rsquo;s work, which comprises two streams: at national level, supports to UN and civil society partners aim to influence policy and national processes which address gender equality. At community level, direct interventions support women and children affected by violence and work with men and boys to reduce the incidence of violence. </p><p>In South Africa, where GBV is endemic, Ireland has supported the development and roll-out of a National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide. The Embassy&rsquo;s work also supports research and community-level engagement with men and boys to encourage behaviour change. In Zimbabwe, the Embassy has worked with UNFPA to lobby for the review of laws and policies to prevent child marriage, and to hold perpetrators of intimate partner violence to account, while civil society organisations supported by the Embassy run shelters and provide access to essential services for survivors of GBV. At regional level, the Embassy supports UN Women&rsquo;s multi-country office for South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana, and Namibia, to implement the Southern African Development Community&rsquo;s (SADC) Framework for Action on GBV. </p><p>In South Africa, the Embassy&rsquo;s flagship education programme is the Kader Asmal Fellowship Programme, named in honour of the late Professor Kader Asmal who taught at Trinity College Dublin, co-founded the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement, and was part of the team that negotiated South Africa&rsquo;s transition to democracy. Through this programme, Ireland supports students from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Lesotho to study at Master&rsquo;s degree level in Ireland in strategically important disciplines. 81 Fellowships have been awarded since the programme commenced in 2013, and 14 South Africans were offered fellowships for the 2020/21 academic year.</p></reply>

In seeking to reach the furthest behind first, Ireland plays an important role in supporting and strengthening social protection systems in Tanzania. </p><p>To reduce humanitarian need and support the refugee response in Tanzania, Ireland has provided much-needed support to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In May 2020, an OECD review recognised the excellence of Irish Aid, Ireland&rsquo;s international development programme, which helps Ireland play a leading role advocating for poverty reduction, channelling our assistance to where it is needed most.</p>  <p>  The Embassy of Ireland in Uganda opened in 1994, with the establishment of the Irish Aid programme in the country. Guided by the priorities of &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, Ireland&rsquo;s focus on the most vulnerable sections of society has been consistent, including through the longstanding prioritisation of the poorest and most marginalised region of Uganda, Karamoja. Ireland&rsquo;s engagement is recognised for its strong focus on girls&rsquo; education, HIV prevention, and support of social welfare grants for senior citizens. This focus remains highly relevant in providing targeted support to those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Embassy and its partners will continue to address the impacts of COVID-19 through its programming in 2021.</p>  <p>  Ireland has played a key role in supporting an expanded social protection programme in Uganda. A critical component of this programme is the provision of social welfare payments to senior citizens. Ireland&rsquo;s support has helped provide cash transfers and reduce vulnerability of elderly people and their families. This has improved the quality of life across many households, through supporting improved diets as well as increased access to basic health care and education for children. It has also provided opportunities for households to engage in small enterprises. </p>  <p>  Improving access to education is a key priority of Ireland&rsquo;s investment in Uganda. In Karamoja, where education and literacy indicators are the lowest in the country, Ireland supports primary and post primary education, vocational training and skills development, as well as bursaries for the most vulnerable students. Support for strengthened governance also remains an important area of focus, and Ireland has worked closely with the EU and other EU Member State partners through the flagship Democratic Governance Facility (DGF), which provides coordinated support to over ninety organisations working to promote democratic governance and human rights. </p>  <p>  As a result of its progressive open-door refugee policy, Uganda hosts approximately 1.4 million refugees, the largest refugee population in Africa. The needs of this population are greater than ever, with refugee settlements facing increased food insecurity and risk of malnutrition due to financial constraints. The situation has been compounded further by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, Ireland has increased our support for cash transfers, food assistance and provision of basic services to refugees. </p></reply>

The programme operates primarily in Vietnam itself, with a smaller range of activity in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. </p>  <p>  Consistent with the commitment to the "furthest behind first" in Ireland's Policy for International Development, A Better World, the largest component of the Irish Aid programme in Vietnam focuses on poverty reduction for ethnic minorities, aimed at some of that country's poorest and most marginalised communities. The populations and geographical areas targeted by the Ethnic Minorities Programme include more than half of those living in poverty in Vietnam. Irish Aid supports the Vietnamese Government in implementing the programme in five provinces, with a focus on small-scale infrastructure (local roads, schools, clinics, etc.). Ireland's Embassy in Hanoi also coordinates an Ethnic Minority Working Group which helps to shape policy and ensure that the social and economic development of ethnic minority communities remains a priority on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. </p>  <p>  Another important element of Irish activity is the Vietnam-Ireland Exchange Programme (IDEAS), which brings together Irish and Vietnamese experts to build technical, governance and policy development capacity in institutions responsible for economic decision-making in Vietnam. IDEAS also brings promising individuals to Ireland to undertake Master's-level study through the Ireland Fellows programme run by the Department of Foreign Affairs. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s also supports civil society in Vietnam, focusing on the themes of disability, poverty reduction, gender empowerment, capacity development and participatory local governance. Ireland provides funding to national and international civil society partners to strengthen their capacity in research, network building and the creation of coalitions for advocacy and potential social change. This support to civil society aims to influence policy response and service delivery in favour of groups that are marginalised on the basis of gender, migrant status, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity or disability. Ireland also funds youth development projects supporting young, creative and enthusiastic people to grow their ideas and turn them into organised actions. The Embassy has made distinctive choices of partners based on shared values and a commitment to sustainable development, gender equality, human rights and good governance. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Programme operates across Myanmar, Cambodia and Lao PDR and addresses issues of humanitarian need, vulnerability and fragility. The support addresses hunger and under-nutrition; promotes livelihood support for very vulnerable groups; facilitates humanitarian de-mining to reduce loss of life and injury and enable post conflict reconstruction; and provides humanitarian assistance for immediate needs in Myanmar. </p>  <p>  During the course of 2020, the programme put in place additional supports to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable in the region as well as to respond to the impact of devastating floods on hundreds of thousands of people in the last quarter of the year.</p></reply>

While Zambia is classed as a lower middle-income country, much of the population lives in poverty and the country has one of the highest levels of inequality globally. Poverty is significantly worse in rural areas, and for the elderly, women and children. The Embassy of Ireland in Lusaka implements the Irish Aid programme in Zambia with an emphasis on reducing poverty and inequality. </p><p>In line with priorities on climate action and gender equality<i>, </i>a highlight of the programme in Zambia in recent years has been Ireland&rsquo;s work on nutrition. Through a range of partners, the Embassy has worked to promote the availability and consumption of nutritious food products in rural and urban areas. For example, the Embassy has partnered with an organisation which has led to strengthening of agricultural supply chains of nutritious products by stimulating agricultural market development and investments in smallholder farmers, especially among women farmers. </p><p>The Embassy has adapted its programming in recent years to take account of the increasing humanitarian needs in Zambia resulting from climate and other shocks. In 2019, the Embassy partnered with an international NGO to support an emergency school feeding programme in response to a food security crisis in which up to 2.3 million Zambians required urgent support. In 2020 the Embassy partnered with UNICEF to implement an emergency cash transfer programme for 130,000 vulnerable urban households affected by COVID-19. This programme enabled these households to buy nutritious foods and other basic essentials. </p></reply>

Our approach is informed by our own national journey and the political and social transformation that continues to take place in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs actively promotes gender equality in relevant multilateral fora, including through our current membership of the UN Security Council, as well as through debates, resolutions, and statements elsewhere at the UN, such as the Commission on the Status of Women and the Human Rights Council. Likewise, our bilateral missions engage with host Governments and civil society to host numerous events, including in recent years the promotion of St Brigid&rsquo;s Day as a celebration of women&rsquo;s achievements in Ireland and further afield. </p>  <p>  This year, on the occasion of International Women&rsquo;s Day, we are co-hosting a UN Security Council Open Arria-formula meeting on the theme of &ldquo;Call to lead by example: ensuring the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in UN led Peace Processes&rdquo;. Internally, the Department is inviting a distinguished panel of women activists to reflect on how lessons from Ireland&rsquo;s gender equality journey can continue to inform our foreign policy, including in the light of setbacks to women&rsquo;s equality arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  As regards the developing world specifically, 'A Better World: Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development' establishes gender equality as one of four policy priorities and recognises that gender equality is fundamental for the transformation required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>  <p>  'A Better World' commits that we will have an overarching focus on women and girls in all our development partnerships and interventions. Ireland is committed to taking a transformative approach to gender equality, recognising that achieving gender equality involves going beyond looking at individual women and girls and requires approaches that seek to address the key structural and institutional barriers to achieving gender equality and ensuring a focus on men, boys and masculinities.  'A Better World' adopts a twin-track approach in committing to integrate gender equality across all our interventions and to increasing allocations to interventions directly dedicated to achieving gender equality. These commitments include increased funding for women&rsquo;s rights organisations; strengthened support for women&rsquo;s political participation; intensifying our work on Women, Peace and Security and on Gender Based Violence; increased engagement on women&rsquo;s economic empowerment; prioritising education for girls in our commitments in education; and deepening and expanding our engagement on sexual and reproductive health and rights.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is consistently ranked by the OECD Development Assistance Committee as among the OECD member countries with the highest gender equality focus in official development assistance (ODA). In 2019, approximately 76% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral allocable ODA contributed to gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment.</p></reply>

That Strategy signals the Sahel and francophone West Africa for intensified engagement.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges posed by COVID-19, that intensification of engagement has begun. </p>  <p>  As part of our deepened engagement with francophone Africa, in 2019 Ireland joined the Organisation International de la Francophonie (OIF) as an observer member, and appointed an additional diplomatic officer to Embassy Paris to support enhanced political engagement with francophone African states. In 2020, Ireland formally became a member of the African Development Bank, headquartered in Abidjan, Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire.</p>  <p>  A Special Envoy has been appointed for francophone Africa and the Sahel for the duration of our Security Council membership, who engages with a wide range of actors and represents Ireland at key engagements, as well as in the EU network of Special Envoys for the Sahel. </p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in the recently established Coalition for the Sahel, including at Ministerial level, while also joining, as an observer, the Sahel Alliance, an international donor coordination platform for development and humanitarian assistance efforts in the region. </p>  <p>  This engagement builds upon Ireland's longstanding contribution to peace and security efforts in the region, including the presence of Defence Forces personnel in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali), as well as a civilian expert to EUCAP Sahel Niger. </p>  <p>  As members of the United Nations Security Council, Ireland works closely with francophone African States, particularly with Niger as co-penholders on the file of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and as co-chairs of the Informal Expert Group on Climate and Security at the UN Security Council. </p>  <p>  Between 2014-2020, Ireland, through the Irish Aid programme, provided over &euro;43 million in humanitarian and development assistance to francophone States in the Sahel.

The Strategy set out a multi-strand approach to deepening Ireland&rsquo;s relationships with SIDS, building on diplomatic, bilateral, multilateral, and international development links, and fostering closer bonds between our peoples. A partnership approach has been central to the formulation and ongoing implementation of the Strategy, with SIDS consulted regularly to ensure it is relevant to their priorities. </p><p>The Strategy is grounded in the ambition set out in <i>The Global Island</i>and <i>Global Ireland</i>to expand our influence and also reflects the commitment in <i>A Better World </i>to strengthen our relationship with SIDS, especially those most vulnerable to climate impact, and to support initiatives which respond to the specific challenges they face. Most recently, the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future &ndash; reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to deepen its relationship with SIDS. </p><p>The SIDS&rsquo; Strategy contains 36 commitments, of which 32 have been fully or partially implemented. They include:</p><p>- The establishment of a SIDS&rsquo; Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs to lead on SIDS&rsquo; policy.</p><p>- A SIDS Fellowship Programme to bring promising individuals from SIDS to Ireland for Master&rsquo;s-level study.</p><p>- A Trust Fund at the Asian Development Bank to support Asian and Pacific SIDS in projects related to climate resilience and disaster risk reduction. &euro;12 million will be contributed to this fund between 2019-2024.</p><p>- The establishment of regular dialogues (dubbed CeilI) between Ireland and SIDS to inform our policy positions within the EU, UN and other multilateral fora. An early example was a dialogue between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and SIDS&rsquo; representatives at the Our Ocean Wealth conference in Cork in 2019. In addition, a regular cycle of meetings has been developed between the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, T.D. and his Caribbean counterparts at the World Bank/IMF Spring and Annual Meetings in Washington DC. This is particularly relevant given that Ireland shares a World Bank Constituency with the Caribbean States.  </p><p>- Irish support for the SAMOA pathway within the UN, which aims to ensure SIDS-related issues remain high on the UN agenda and to support sustainable development in SIDS - not least by mitigating the effects of climate change. The mid-term review of the process was co-facilitated by Ireland's Ambassador to the UN in New York, Ambassador Geraldine Byrne-Nason, with President Higgins addressing a SIDS&rsquo; Summit at the UN. In 2020 Ireland funded the recruitment of an expert to work on SIDS issues within the UN Secretariat.  </p><p>In addition to these measures, in 2020 my Department undertook its first-ever SIDS-specific humanitarian response, working through the International Federation of the Red Cross and Asian Development Bank in the area of pandemic preparedness and education in SIDS. Ireland provided &euro;3.4m for these activities.</p><p>Ireland is also working to deepen our bilateral policy engagement with SIDS and last October I launched a series of dialogues aimed at bringing together sectoral experts from Ireland and SIDS to discuss policy in areas of mutual interest. Last week I hosted a dialogue on Diaspora engagement with  representatives of 12 Caribbean and African SIDS and I will host a second dialogue with Pacific States at the end of the month. </p><p>The development and implementation of the Strategy has helped Ireland to deepen its relationship with SIDS and we are perhaps more engaged with this important group than ever before. Importantly, the structures we have put in place will ensure the sustainability of these efforts over the years to come. </p></reply>

The conflict has had a devastating impact on the population of Tigray, and poses severe risks to the stability of Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa region. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports calls by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for independent, impartial, thorough and transparent investigations into alleged serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in Tigray, to ensure accountability and, where appropriate, justice. </p>  <p>  On 26 February, Amnesty International reported that hundreds of unarmed civilians were massacred in Axum last November and that these crimes were perpetrated mainly by Eritrean troops. </p>  <p>  The EU most recently discussed the situation in Ethiopia at the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 February, following a visit to Ethiopia and Sudan by the Finnish Foreign Minister on behalf of High Representative Borrell.  Minister Coveney spoke with his Finnish counterpart both before and after his visit.  Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s call for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from Ethiopia, whose presence remains a barrier to humanitarian access and is linked to these and other alleged atrocities. </p>  <p>  Ireland raised the Tigray situation at the UN Security Council on 3 February and again on 4 March, expressing deep concern at the humanitarian situation in Tigray and calling for unhindered humanitarian access. Ireland also called on all parties in Tigray to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law including those related to the protection of civilians and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to advocate for an urgent response to the humanitarian situation, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict through bilateral engagement, our EU membership and also at the UN Security Council, where we remain actively engaged with other Council members on further ways to address the crisis. Minister Coveney continues to raise these issues with key interlocutors, including with his counterparts in the region. He has condemned reported atrocities and identity-based attacks, and has called for the human rights of all Ethiopians to be upheld.</p>  <p>  My Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis. This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. </p>  <p>  Unrest in other parts of Ethiopia,  including Oromia Region and Benshangul-Gumuz, is also of concern.  The Embassy of Ireland in Addis Ababa continues to monitor these situations closely in cooperation with our EU and UN partners.  </p>  <p>  Ethiopia will hold general elections on 5 June.  Ireland looks forward to free, fair and inclusive elections on that date.  </p></reply>

The ongoing work of this Task Force has continued during COVID-19. The Office of Emergency Planning, which is established within the Department of Defence, is directly involved in supporting myself as Chair of the Task Force and the Departments who form its membership. This support includes work on areas such as critical infrastructure resilience, risk management and emergency communications. The Office of Emergency Planning also manages and operates the National Emergency Coordination Centre and leads on public safety information campaigns, such as &ldquo;Be Winter Ready&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be Summer Ready&rdquo;.</p><p>The Office of Emergency Planning, with the participation and assistance of all Government Departments and Agencies and Dublin City University Business School, prepared the National Risk Assessment for Ireland<b></b>2020 which was recently adopted by the Government Task Force and which I will present to Government shortly. The purpose of the National Risk Assessment, which is undertaken on a three yearly cycle, is to identify the key risks facing the State across a broad range of emergencies, to assess the likelihood and impact of these risks and to inform actions at a national level aimed at mitigating such risks. It provides a basis for establishing priorities with regard to risk mitigation at national level and to inform Government decisions regarding resource allocation. It replaces the National Risk Assessment for Ireland 2017. </p><p>In the event of an emergency at a National level or threats posed by an emerging emergency situation, the <i>Strategic Emergency Management National Structures and Framework, </i>approved by Government in July 2017, outlines the Lead Government Department principle and how this is applied across a &quot;whole of Government&quot; approach to managing such responses, including pandemics. The Government Task Force oversaw the development of this Framework based on extensive engagement with the Lead Government Departments. The Office of Emergency Planning provides support to these structures in the event of an emergency response being deemed necessary by the Lead Department responsible. Due to the severity of the impact on public health and economic life presented by COVID-19, adapted structures were introduced to manage these risks as envisaged in the <i>Strategic Emergency Management National Structures and Framework</i>. </p><p>As Chair of the Government Task Force, I am satisfied that these response arrangements provide a coordinated whole of Government approach.</p></reply>

They can also opt to sit the Leaving Certificate Examination. Students will opt into these processes on a subject by subject basis. Where students opt for SEC-Accredited Grades and the examinations they will be credited with the better of their results from the two processes, on a subject by subject basis. </p><p>It is my view that students must be afforded the choice as to whether to sit the examinations, including the oral and coursework components, as it would be entirely unfair to students to require them to participate in these elements, given the disruption in learning which has occurred.  The oral and coursework components of the examinations will not form part of the Accredited Grade process.  </p><p>However, when estimating marks for the Accredited Grades, teachers will be asked to consider the student&rsquo;s progress and likely performance across all components of the subject &ndash; oral, practical, projects and written. This will ensure that the estimated mark submitted by the school to the SEC reflects the candidate&rsquo;s work and progress across all aspects of the subject. </p><p>Further information is available in <i>A Guide to State Examinations and Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021</i>which has been published on . This guide has also been communicated to schools.</p><p>The Guide provides information regarding coursework and mock examinations and advises that mock examinations (i.e. examinations involving full class groups sitting written examinations under conditions that mirror those of the certificate examinations) are neither required nor recommended for use as evidence for the Accredited Grades process.  The period following the return to in-school teaching and learning should be used to maximise opportunities for teaching and learning with students.</p><p>Following the return to school, the guidance provided states that teachers may set a limited number of additional assessments up to 14 May 2021, though it is important in the period leading up to the determination of estimated percentage marks that over-assessment is avoided. If administering an in-class teacher-designed test, the test should be no more than one lesson in duration (maximum one hour) and a maximum of three class tests may be administered up to 14 May 2021. </p><p>The State Examinations Commission has also recently published and sent to schools further information in relation to the arrangements for the Leaving Certificate examinations. Included in this document are details in relation to Coursework Completion dates and Orals, Practicals and Music Practical Performance Tests. The document is available on the SEC website as circular S07/21.</p></reply>

Also, due to the uncertainties of how GLPs would happen, any scheduled placements were put on hold for the 2020/2021 academic year.</p><p>The Department of Education has been working for some time with stakeholders, including the Teaching Council, the Higher Education Institutes (including the College referred to by the Deputy), the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and CONCOS (umbrella body for Gaeltacht Colleges), to develop contingency arrangements to allow for the completion of GLPs in the current academic year. An agreement has now been reached to proceed with the delivery of an online version of the course in 2021.</p><p>These contingency plans allow for all placements scheduled to take place this year, related to the 2020/21 academic year, along with those postponed from 2020. It will also ensure that any final year students have the opportunity to graduate as scheduled in summer 2021. </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for the re-instatement of the grant to cover the full cost of the Gaeltacht Learning Periods (GLPs) for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary ITE programmes, with effect from the 2020/2021 academic year.  The grant was previously funded by the Department of Education up to the 2012/2013 academic year, when it was ceased due to financial constraints.  The rate of the re-introduced student grant for 2021 has been set at an average of &euro;650.  This will cover the cost of the undertaking the fortnightly online course in 2021. The re-introduced grant will be made available for undergraduate and post-graduate students in State-funded primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. This is in line with normal practice for other grant payments per students qualifying requirements.</p><p>In recent years, it is understood that students had paid an average of &euro;750 for undertaking a fortnightly GLP in the Gaeltacht. This average cost has been in place for many years and included a contribution to cover accommodation costs associated with attending the course in the Gaeltacht. While the accommodation costs do not arise this year, it is acknowledged that Gaeltacht College providers do face a number of additional costs associated with the preparation, design and delivery of a new online programme. It should be noted that in normal circumstances, Gaeltacht householders who provide accommodation to trainee teachers attending recognised courses in Gaeltacht regions also qualify for a daily grant of &euro;10 per night under the terms of <i>Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge</i>which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p><p>It is the shared aim of all of the stakeholders involved that students experience a quality online programme.  HEIs are currently working directly with their Gaeltacht College providers on implementing the practical and administrative arrangements for delivery of the GLP.</p><p>An allowance has been made for 2<sup>nd</sup>year Professional Masters in Education (PME) students (including students in the College referred to by the Deputy). Those 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have not completed any GLP will now complete a 3 week online programme (had previously been required to complete 4 weeks). 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students who have completed some of their required GLP will now be required to complete the remaining balance (up to a total requirement of 3 weeks) online. This particular allowance, approved by the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Education Committee, recognised the significant timetabling issues facing 2<sup>nd</sup>year PME students in respect of school placement, the GLP and normal course work.</p><p>The College referred to by the Deputy is an independent private provider of ITE programmes.  In relation to the cost of the online programme for students in that College, the Department of Education has recently responded to a proposal from that College confirming that both the Department and the Teaching Council has no issue with that College, working in collaboration with a Gaeltacht College(s) to provide an online programme based on the agreed syllabus for their own students and to negotiate and set the cost for undertaking that programme for their own students.</p><p>The Department understands that the College referred to by the Deputy has now organised the provision of an online GLP programme for all of their students in collaboration with one Gaeltacht College.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs.  A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme.  The main purpose of the programme was to provide professional development and not the provision of a qualification.  Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period.  Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future.</p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  I look forward to its development.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the new training programme for SNAs now in place is of high quality and will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

They can also opt to sit the Leaving Certificate Examination. Students will opt into these processes on a subject by subject basis. Where students opt for SEC-Accredited Grades and the examinations they will be credited with the better of their results from the two processes, on a subject by subject basis. </p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.  On 21 December 2020, my Department published an updated version of the publication which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure.  As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice.  The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time.  The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework.  The State Examinations Commission provided an update in relation to the arrangements for the delivery of the Leaving Certificate examinations, including an update in relation to coursework, following the announcement by the Government on Wednesday 17 February.  That circular is available at   </p><p>In addition to the adjustment to the assessment arrangements for the examinations previously communicated to schools, further adjustments will be made to the written papers.  These further adjustments will aim to reduce the load on students, leaving intact the general overall structure of the written examination papers.  In the majority of cases these adjustments will involve reducing the number of questions that students will be required to answer.  The duration of the examinations will remain the same as set out in the published timetable, thus providing students with additional time to read the paper and answer the required number of questions. </p><p>Further subject-by-subject information in relation to these adjustments will be issued by the SEC in the week of 22 March.</p></reply>

As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, SNAs and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.  </p>  <p>  Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of the investment in special education and the supports which have been put in place, I am also very conscious that there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the NCSE is acutely aware of these concerns and is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and other stakeholders to bring the required additional special education placements on stream.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education and I want to reassure you that the delivery of the necessary additional provision is being progressed as an absolute priority.</p>  <p>  The admission policies of schools are the remit of the Board of Management of each school and, as such, the NCSE has no role in relation to the number of applicants or waiting lists. Once schools notify NCSE of vacancies within their specialist provision, SENOs work locally to ensure parents are made aware of these special class places.  </p>  <p>  I am assured that the local SENO is currently engaging with, and remains available, to support these families in finding a suitable placement.</p></reply>

Since Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including students currently in fifth year, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.  </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.  These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  </p><p>The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools earlier last year, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period.  Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.  </p><p>Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning. Circular 0074/2020, &lsquo;Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform&rsquo;, was issued by the Department last year.  In accordance with the circular, it became a requirement for all schools to have in place a communication/learning platform (while acknowledging that many schools have already put such platforms in place) that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of some use of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.</p><p>The Circular includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), including information and resources for commonly used platforms for teaching, learning and assessment,  short video tutorials exploring how digital platforms and tools can be used effectively for remote learning purposes and clarity regarding how chosen platforms can be effectively used for assessment and feedback purposes. </p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include <i>Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education</i>and <i>Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers</i>. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p><p>The www.gov.ie/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service in my Department, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed.  My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.</p></reply>

This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings, to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, we will invest &euro;8.4 billion in primary and post primary school buildings.

The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.  <i></i></p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places. </p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is aware of those parents whose children will be seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.<i></i></p><p>The NCSE has advised that they are actively engaged with all of the Primary and Post Primary Schools in the Ballincollig area regarding the establishment of special class provision.  Engagement with schools has now reached an advanced stage with those schools committed to the establishment of special classes progressing applications for the additional accommodation required to ensure a timely provision of classes over the coming years.</p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: <i></i>.  Information on the list of schools with special classes is available at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen.</p><p>Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.</p><p>Tusla's Educational Welfare Service has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p><p>A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p><p>Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.  </p><p>Further to the receipt of policy advice from the NCSE, the Department of Education established an Expert Working Group to develop guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours (including the use of physical interventions) where such behaviour is considered as likely to present serious risk of physical harm to the student concerned and/or others within the school environment. </p><p>Development of the Guidelines has been informed by evidence showing that whole school positive behavioural approaches and early and ongoing engagement with the school community, including parents/guardians, are necessary for the development of effective school policy and practice. </p><p>Following consideration of the views and contributions received as part of the consultation process, a final draft of the guidelines has been prepared and is being considered by the Department.  They place a strong focus on prevention and early intervention strategies for the management of crisis student behaviour in which physical intervention may be employed only as the last part of a comprehensive, positive and planned behavioural approach by the school. They are underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour and the need for such incidents to be recorded. </p><p>The guidelines when issued will apply to all schools. In this regard, consideration is being given to the implementation of guidelines by schools including the kind of supports and training that may be required.  </p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim. On 27th of October 2020 under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach will be taken to the development of proposals. The parties are currently scheduled to return to the WRC this month and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. </p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions. </p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at .</p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.</p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including those children who have ADHD, Dyslexia, or Dispraxia, can therefore receive additional teaching support in schools, without a requirement for them to have a formal assessment of need.</p><p>I can also advise that an Education Passport has been devised by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) which includes a suite of materials to support the reporting and transfer of pupil information from primary to post-primary schools.</p><p>An Education Passport, for each pupil, should be sent to the relevant post-primary school following confirmation of enrolment and, ideally, by the end of June.  Since 2014/15, schools are required to use the NCCA Education Passport materials to support the reporting and transfer of pupil information at the end of sixth class. The materials are presented under the umbrella title of &ldquo;Education Passport&rdquo; </p><p>The &lsquo;Education Passport' is a compulsory requirement for all 6th class pupils in their transition from Primary to Post-Primary School.</p><p>Details of the Education passport are available at: <i> </i></p></reply>

The current OHS provider has a process in place for school staff with health concerns about their risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, through workplace attendance. </p><p>A detailed on-line questionnaire is submitted by the teacher to the OHS, along with detailed medical evidence to provide clarity with respect to the medical complaint(s) in question.  All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when a teacher suffers from more than one health condition.  The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  A teacher is categorised into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are &lsquo;Normal Risk&rsquo;, High Risk&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo;. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the latest HSE guidance.My Department is following the same guidance that is in use across the public sector.  The latest HSE guidance on the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group is at:  <i></i>.  </p><p>Where a teacher considers the OHS &quot;Covid-19 Health Risk Categorisation report&quot; places him/her in an incorrect risk category, he/she may request review. The teacher may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. </p><p>Based on HSE advice, a teacher categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;Very High Risk&rsquo; must not attend the workplace.  However he/she remains available for work and the employer should prioritise alternative working arrangements to the maximum extent possible e.g. working from home.</p><p>The employer has a responsibility to assess the school environment using the COVID-19 Response Plan for the school, to ensure that all the appropriate HSE recommendations for safe school operations during Covid-19 are being implemented in full.  </p><p>During the current period of partial re-opening of primary and post primary schools, an employer should temporarily facilitate more flexible working arrangements where a teacher has been categorised by the OHS as &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo;. A teacher who is over 60 years of age should also be temporarily facilitated by these arrangements. This may include re-assignment of a teacher to other duties within the school or facilitated to work remotely i.e. working from home.  When schools fully re-open, these flexible working arrangements will no longer be available and therefore a teacher in the &lsquo;High Risk&rsquo; group who is medically fit for work must return to the workplace.</p></reply>

Therefore any standard accrual member may continue in pensionable employment until 70 years of age.  Such members are not obliged to retire at the normal retirement age (66 in this case). The normal retirement age is the earliest age at which a member can choose to retire with full benefits (i.e. not actuarially reduced). </p></reply>

A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  </p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  A prospective patron can choose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (where applicable).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process. </p>  <p>  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 47 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022.

This is in addition to previously announced one-point reduction for Senior Urban Band 1 schools from 24:1 to 23:1.

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman's Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department.</p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim.

A service operates to the school of attendance with a pick up point of 6.3 km from where the child resides.</p>  <p>  For a service to be established closer to where the child resides at least 10 eligible pupils from a distinct location would have to be availing of the service.</p>  <p>  As this child resides more than 3.2 km from home to the pick-up point, and is eligible for school transport the child will be entitled to the Remote Area Grant from where the child resides to the pick-up point.</p>  <p>  School Transport Section of the Department of Education will contact the family in due course to advise of eligibility for the remote area grant to the pick-up point and the process involved in claiming this grant.

The State will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or over 20% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.</p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing. Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school.</p><p>Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>As Minister, I have powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p><p>This legal power to compel schools to open new special classes is only used where the following criteria apply:</p> <blockquote> 	- there is established need for additional places in an area;<br /><br />- it is considered that the schools involved in the Section 37 process have capacity to open the additional classes; and <br /><br />- all reasonable efforts have been made to support these schools in making the required provision. </blockquote>  <p>The legislation has been used twice to date.  Firstly, in respect of the Dublin 15 area in 2019. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new special school was established and six schools agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area.</p><p>The legislation has been used for a second time in the South Dublin area in 2020. This legal process is still underway and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p><p>However, I would like to reassure the Deputy that progress is being made and my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>I can also reassure the Deputy that the local SENOs continue to be available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

This Scheme was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC). The Council is comprised of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Education and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>The purpose of the Temporary Re-Assignment Scheme is to facilitate an arrangement between two eligible teachers who, with the approval of their respective employers, wish to apply for temporary re-assignment to a different school for educational purposes. The provisions of the Scheme are set out in Chapter 9 of Circular 0054/2019.</p><p>Paragraph 1.3 of the Circular states:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;A teacher may apply for temporary re-assignment to a different school for educational purposes which includes enabling teachers in primary schools to enhance their professional experience by teaching in different types of settings and enrich their personal knowledge which can then be shared with colleagues. <br /><br />For example, a teacher could seek a temporary re-assignment between:    	- an urban school and a rural school or vice versa<br /><br />- a large school with a single class per teacher and a smaller school with multi-grade classes<br /><br />- a junior school, that is infants to second class and a senior school where they would teach third to sixth class<br /><br />- a single gender school and a mixed gender school<br /><br />- a mainstream school and a special school <br /><br />- a DEIS school and a non-DEIS school<br /><br />- a multi-medium school and a Gaelscoil/school in a Gaeltacht area or vice versa&rdquo;.    </blockquote>  <p>In accordance with the terms of the scheme, the minimum period for which a re-assignment may be facilitated is one school year and the maximum is three school years. Applications for Temporary Re-Assignment are approved by the Board of Management of each school, and details thereof are notified to my Department. On conclusion of the temporary Re-Assignment period the teacher must return to his/her original school and no further Temporary Re-Assignment can be entered into in the course of their career.</p><p>The core function of the panel arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent/CID holding teachers, to other schools that have vacancies. Primary schools are required to fill permanent vacancies from teachers on the Main Redeployment Panel in the first instance and thereafter from Supplementary Redeployment Panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. Primary teachers are placed on redeployment panels in line with the patronage of the school from which they are redeployed and are available to schools with teaching vacancies that are within a 45km distance of the teacher&rsquo;s base school.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post-Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post-Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child's education cycle. Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport as they are not attending their nearest post-primary school. A refund of the school transport charge was processed on 10th September 2020.</p></reply>

It will run for the period of one year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.

It notes recent research on the topic, and reflects the experience of a number of voluntary groups working with people experiencing poverty and deprivation. This is a interesting report in the context  of the work my Department is undertaking to address social inclusion under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025.</p><p>This Roadmap for Social Inclusion which was published in January 2020, is the Government's strategy to address poverty and social inclusion in Ireland. It sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition to reduce consistent poverty to 2% or less by 2025 and to make Ireland one of the most socially inclusive states in the EU. The aim of the Roadmap is to achieve this ambitious target by  delivering 66  commitments across Government Departments. In the context of the &lsquo;Hungry bellies&rsquo; report, it is important to note that the Roadmap looks beyond income as the only measure of addressing exclusion or inequality. The Programme for Government includes a commitment for the implementation of the Roadmap.  As Minister of State with responsibility for social inclusion, I am the Chair of the Social Inclusion Roadmap Steering Group, which oversees the implementation of the Roadmap across Government and monitors its progress. This group met for the first time in November 2020 and is due to meet again on 30th March.</p><p>The Roadmap contains a range of targets based on data collected as part of the annual Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), the official source of data on household and equivalised disposable income in Ireland, undertaken by the CSO.  It provides a number of key national poverty indicators, including the &lsquo;at risk of poverty rate&rsquo;, the &lsquo;consistent poverty rate&rsquo; and the &lsquo;enforced deprivation rate&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<i>Hungry Bellies</i>&rsquo; report refers to the most recent Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data from 2019 which was published in late 2020. This data reflects income and living conditions in Ireland in 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic.  The SILC data for 2020, which will reflect the impact of Covid-19, is unlikely to be available until Q4 2021.  </p><p>The 2019 SILC data showed that basic deprivation (which measures the percentage of the population experiencing enforced deprivation) had increased from 15.1% in 2018 to 17.8% in 2019. However the At-Risk-of-Poverty rate, which measures the percentage of the population experiencing relative income poverty, had fallen from 14.0% to 12.8% in the same period.  The consistent poverty rate, which measures the percentage of the population who are both at risk of poverty and experiencing deprivation, decreased slightly to 5.5% in 2019, from the 2018 rate of 5.6%.  Information on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions is available at: </p><p>It is reasonable to expect that the 2020 SILC data will reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on household incomes.  However this impact is likely to be lessened to some degree by the introduction by Government of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), as part of their Budget Perspectives series in 2020, highlighted the importance of the social protection system for supporting those on low-incomes in general and the role of pandemic supports in &lsquo;cushioning&rsquo; the impact of the unemployment shock related to the pandemic, with the drop in income resulting from pandemic-related unemployment softened by the pandemic income supports.  </p><p>In addition, Budget 2021 included a range of targeted social welfare measures to assist low income families and households, including an increase in the weekly fuel allowance rate; increases to the qualified child rates for children under and over 12 years of age; an increase in the living alone allowance as well as increases to the weekly income threshold for the Working Family Payment and to the income disregard for the Disability Allowance. These measures will contribute to the ongoing support to low income households provided by the social protection system.</p><p>I thank the Deputy for her question and hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  The only exception to this is the enhanced illness benefit payment in respect of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department administers the Illness Benefit scheme to those customers who cannot work because they are sick or ill.  Customers must be covered by the appropriate class of social insurance (PRSI), satisfy the PRSI conditions and provide a Certificate of Incapacity for Work from a medical practitioner.</p>  <p>  Illness benefit is payable for one year (312 days excluding Sundays) in respect of people with a minimum of 104 contributions and for two years (624 days excluding Sundays) for people with a minimum of 260 contributions, subject to meeting the other medical and contribution eligibility criteria for the scheme, as set out in legislation.</p>  <p>  A person who is not eligible for Illness Benefit or whose Illness Benefit expires and who is unable to work may be eligible for other payments depending on their circumstances:</p>  <p>  - Invalidity Pension is a weekly payment to people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability, who are likely to be permanently incapable of work and who satisfy the PRSI conditions.</p>  <p>  - Disability Allowance is a means tested payment for people who have a disability that is expected to last for a year or more.</p>  <p>  - Supplementary Welfare Allowance is available to people who are ill, who do not qualify for other payments and who have insufficient means to meet their needs.</p>  <p>  A person may requalify for Illness Benefit if they return to work and pay a minimum of 13 reckonable PRSI contributions.  (All other qualifying conditions must also be satisfied.)</p>  <p>  The rate of Illness Benefit payment is based on a person's weekly earnings in the governing contribution year.  There are four rates of payment up to a maximum of &euro;203.  Increases can be paid in respect of a qualified adult or qualified children.</p>  <p>  In addition to the payments listed above, a temporary enhanced Illness Benefit payment was introduced in March 2020 in respect of Covid-19.  Its purpose is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  The rate of the enhanced  Illness Benefit payment for Covid-19 is &euro;350 per week, with additional payments possible in respect of a qualified adult and qualified children.  The payment is made for a defined maximum period for each of the two situations listed.  The measures were designed to ensure that, where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer of health diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate.   </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for maternity benefit, a person must be in employment immediately before the first day of her maternity leave. The last day of insurable employment must be within 16 weeks of the end of the week in which her baby is due. If a woman satisfies these conditions and ceases employment within this 16 week timeframe, payment of maternity benefit can commence from the following day. In 2021, it is estimated that my Department will spend approximately &euro;261 million on maternity benefit.</p>  <p>  The fundamental qualification criteria for maternity benefit are that a woman must be in insurable employment or self-employment and is entitled to statutory maternity leave. The applicant must also satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. These conditions must be satisfied by the applicant in their own right.</p>  <p>  Where an individual is not in employment within the 16 week timeframe or has insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for maternity benefit, they may be eligible for another social welfare payment provided they meet the relevant conditions. </p>  <p>  New mothers who do not qualify for maternity benefit may also be eligible for a payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme. This scheme is considered a "safety net" within the overall social welfare system for eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other welfare schemes. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These issues are being considered from a perspective of fiscal and social sustainability, and intergenerational fairness.  It has held eight meetings to date and will report on its findings by the end of June 2021.  In this regard, the Commission is halfway through its work. </p><p>Membership of the Commission includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  This includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  The ICTU nomination on the Commission is a senior representative from SIPTU, a founding member of the Stop 67 coalition, and a member of the Executive Board of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  I was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female representation in its membership, and I am pleased that the majority of members &ndash; 7 out of 11 &ndash; are women.  It is imperative that the Commission has the required expertise to progress its work and is independent in its deliberations.</p><p>As part of its work, the Commission has been asked to seek the views of recognised experts and representative groups by inviting submissions and presentations. Details on the Commission's work is available on its website, PensionsCommission.gov.ie. The Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process closed just this week on the 9th of March.  It sought submissions by email or by post from interested parties on sustainable State Pensions arrangements into the future.  There was also a survey for those who did not wish to make a formal submission. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, is well equipped to grasp the potential impacts of any pensions reform options on affected groups, such as women, workers, and older people.  It is of particular importance to consider the impact of any potential changes to the State Pension system on those who rely on it for all or most of their income.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.  </p></reply>

The payment is a contribution towards heating costs, it is not intended to meet these costs in full.  The payment is made at the weekly rate of &euro;28.00; or if preferred, by way of two lump sum payments; and is paid over the winter season (28 weeks in the 2020/2021 fuel allowance season).  Only one Fuel Allowance is payable per household.   </p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance applications are processed by the customer's primary scheme payment area, across a number of different (IT) platforms.  For this reason, the average waiting time for a decision on a Fuel Allowance application can vary.  Decision waiting times can also fluctuate based on the level of applications received, for example during or outside of the winter fuel allowance season.  Additionally, where further information is requested before a decision on eligibility can be made (generally relating to means or household composition), delays in the provision of the required information can occur.  While is not possible to provide an average timeframe for a Fuel Allowance decision, given the variables set out, my Department is currently unaware of any area  experiencing  any delays in processing of Fuel Allowance applications for customers.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.</p><p>At this point, I want to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform  are engaging in discussions on this issue and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.</p><p>Funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, these matters take time to resolve given the complexity of the subject, the wider financial implications and the number of parties involved.  It is therefore not possible at the present time to predict, how much more time is required to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.  Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Wage Subsidy Scheme gives financial incentives to private sector employers to employ people with a disability. </p>  <p>  I received notification from this employer on 17 February 2021 of proposed collective redundancies at a place of business. I noted and welcomed the employer's commitment to engage in a consultation process with affected employees from the week beginning 21 February in order to identify solutions and reach agreement in relation to the proposed redundancies.  I also noted the employer's commitment that, where a decision was taken to proceed with the proposed redundancies following the period of consultation, the employer would honour the employees' contractual and statutory rights with respect to a redundancy package as part of this process.   </p>  <p>  It is the employer's responsibility to pay all eligible employees their redundancy entitlements.

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs). </p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The scheme ensures that, for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.</p><p>Under the SWA scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, officers can make a single exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p><p>Statistics are maintained on the number of applications awarded under the SWA scheme.

In Phase 1, my Department will continue to provide Daily Expenses Allowance, as the income support payment to protection applicants while they stay in the Reception and Integration centre. The estimated cost for daily expenses allowance in the first 4 months in the Reception and Integration centre to my Department is &euro;3.7m. These costings have been developed based on the assumption that the new model needs to have capacity to meet the needs of 3,500 applicants per year, of whom one-third will be children.</p>  <p>  In Phase 2, applicants will move out of the Reception and Integration Centres to accommodation in the community.

I note that the paper considers a number of issues concerning self-employed workers, and groups these into the four policy areas of: the social insurance contributions made by self-employed workers;  the social protection supports provided to them; the differentiation between employed and self-employed workers; and representation for self-employed workers.</p><p>With respect to the level of contribution to the social insurance fund by self-employed workers, they are now covered for most of the benefits available under the social insurance scheme which represents approximately 93% of the value of all benefits paid by the social insurance fund - in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than that made in respect of employed contributors.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government includes a commitment that consideration will be given to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed and the NESC paper will inform my Department's consideration in that regard.</p><p>The second issue relates to the levels of welfare support provided to self-employed workers.  My Department offers a range of income supports to self-employed people, including -</p><p>- jobseeker's benefit (self-employed),</p><p>- the option of applying for a means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance instead depending on their personal circumstances,</p><p>- the pandemic unemployment payment,</p><p>- facilitating self-employed workers who are in receipt of  the pandemic unemployment payment and who are seeking to maintain their business, to earn up to &euro;960 over an eight week period while maintaining their full payment entitlement,</p><p>- the enhanced illness benefit payment of &euro;350 per week where they have been medically diagnosed with COVID or have been medically advised to self-isolate or restrict their movements,</p><p>- the back to work enterprise allowance scheme which offers support to people who are long-term unemployed and who are interested in self-employment as a route to entering the labour market - this allowance is payable to self-employed workers for up to a 24-month period from the commencement of their new business,</p><p>- the once-off enterprise support grant of up to &euro;1,000 to assist with the costs associated with reopening a business following the imposition of Covid-related restrictions, and</p><p>- my Department's employment support services on a voluntary basis through their local Intreo Centre.</p><p>With respect to the categorisation of self-employed workers matter, my Department&rsquo;s social welfare inspectorate carry out, as part of their duties, employer investigations to ensure compliance with social insurance law and employment status investigations form part of this work. The approach to addressing potential false self-employment includes the setting up of a new team of inspectors in late 2019 to focus entirely on detecting and investigating such practices.  In recognising the need to increase awareness in this area, my Department is leading an interdepartmental group on updating and revising the important &lsquo;<i>Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment</i>&rsquo;.  In consultation with other departments and the social partners, I expect this revised Code to be published in the coming months.</p><p>Finally, in the area of representation, industrial relations in Ireland rests on a voluntary model.  The State&rsquo;s role is largely restricted to the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association.Progressing matters of representation come within the remit of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. </p>  <p>  The State Pension Contributory (SPC) is a contributory payment and, as such, is not means tested. A recipient of the SPC can claim an increase to their pension in respect of a qualified adult (IQA).  A qualified adult is the spouse / partner of the pensioner who is being wholly or mainly maintained by the pensioner. </p>  <p>  An increase for a qualified adult may be payable at the maximum rate of payment where the means of the spouse/partner are &euro;100 a week or less, while reduced rates are payable where the means are over &euro;100 and less than &euro;310 per week.  No increase is payable where the means of the spouse/partner are in excess of &euro;310 per week.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) is a means-tested payment for people aged 66 or over who do not qualify for the SPC based on their social insurance record. </p>  <p>  As such, all recipients of the SPNC are subject to a means test. Social welfare legislation provides that all income and capital belonging to an applicant (and his or her spouse/partner, where applicable) is assessable for means testing purposes for social assistance schemes, such as the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC).  This includes all income and property (other than the family home) belonging to the claimant.  </p>  <p>  To calculate the rate payable, the means of the claimant is deducted from the maximum rate of SPNC. In cases where the means of the claimant exceed the maximum rate, the claimant is not entitled to any payment. </p>  <p>  SPNC recipients can earn up to &euro;200 per week from employment without their rate of payment being affected. In addition, the first &euro;30 of means from any source is also disregarded.  </p>  <p>  The living alone allowance is not taken into account in the means test for the SPNC or the means test for a SPC recipient's qualified adult. </p>  <p>  Increasing either the income disregards for the SPNC or the income thresholds for an IQA on the SPC may have significant cost implications and would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p><p>Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.  Until 2019, a hot meal was only provided through a dinner club which was primarily offered in schools with onsite cooking facilities. </p><p>In Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.  </p><p>Budget 2020 provided an additional &euro;4 million in funding to extend the hot meals for children currently receiving the cold lunch option, which would allow my department to extend the hot meals to an additional 35,000 children.  A decision was made to delay the extension of the hot meals to January 2021 because of the closure of schools due to the Covid-19 Pandemic from 13 March 2020.  </p><p>In Budget 2021, I have provided an additional &euro;5.5m for this extension from January 2021 to 35,000 primary school children currently receiving the cold lunch option.  </p><p>Officials from my Department issued invitations for expressions of interest to some 700 primary schools in November 2020. A total of 282 expressions of interest were received. Due to the latest school closures, as a result of the Level 5 restrictions, the selection process has been deferred until schools re-open later this month.</p><p>The Evaluation of the Hot Meals Pilot which was completed in July 2020 found that all stakeholders indicated that the pilot project had a positive impact on children&rsquo;s diet, behaviour, attentiveness and psychological wellbeing.  I intend to publish the evaluation report shortly.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The draft Government Order to establish the Commission was also approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The overarching objective in developing the terms of reference was to establish a Commission capable of providing a full account of what happened in these institutions over the period 1922-1998. </p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference were focused on a combination of four distinct factors:</p>  <p>- Clarifying that the intended focus is on single women and children being accommodated for the purpose of receiving extended and supervised maternity and infant care services in Mother and Baby Homes; </p>  <p>- Defining the specific issues of public concern as discrete matters to be investigated;</p>  <p>- Specifying a list of Mother and Baby Homes and, in addition, providing for examination of equivalent experiences within the network of County Homes;</p>  <p>- Defining the relevant period as being from 1922 to 1998, while allowing the Commission to reduce the &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; in respect of any component part or institution if it considers it appropriate to do so.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the approach taken provided for the intended clear and deliberate emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in Mother and Baby Homes. </p>  <p>  In examining the exit pathways of children, the Commission was required to investigate the nature of the relationship between Mother and Baby Homes and other key institutions &ndash; these included children&rsquo;s homes; orphanages; and adoption societies. This involved the identification of patterns of referral and the practices and arrangements for the placement of children. It also included where an intermediary organisation was involved in arranging a subsequent placement.  </p>  <p>  The examination was also to identify the extent to which children&rsquo;s welfare and best interests were considered in making arrangements for their placement both here in Ireland and abroad. The Commission was further asked to identify the extent of mothers&rsquo; participation in such decisions, including procedures around mothers&rsquo; consent, and the extent to which these procedures were sufficient to ensure that consent was full, free and informed. The Commission was therefore provided with sufficient scope to examine the placing of children for adoption at home and abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s final Report addresses important questions in relation to the practices in place during the period under investigation. The Commission was able to cross-reference information from the institutional records, State records, testimony from witnesses and evidence from other sources. </p>  <p>  It is accepted by all parties that, in the past, the arrangements for the placement of children often involved secretive practices, carried out without due regard to the rights of those involved. Such practices reflected wider societal prejudices of the time. Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. </p>  <p>  Separate to the work of the Commission, I have just published an independent review report into incorrect birth registrations. This independent report was commissioned following Tulsa's discovery in early 2018 of evidence of illegal birth registrations in the files of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild adoption society. </p>  <p>  While this review was unable to identify a unique marker suggestive of illegal birth registration in the sampled files I know significant concerns remain about the practice of illegal birth registrations. For that reason, I have asked the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection to consider the very significant complexities and challenges, including the deep ethical issues, which arise in relation to the issue of illegal birth registrations, and to propose an appropriate course of action.</p></reply>

As we have just embarked upon a new reporting cycle, I am cognisant of the importance of examining the implementation of the UN Convention with due consideration of the last Concluding Observations.</p><p>The State is obliged to submit regular reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child (Committee) on measures to give effect to the rights under the UN Convention. Ireland&rsquo;s last appearance before the Committee took place in Geneva, on 14 January 2016. Following this meeting, the Committee published its observations on Ireland&rsquo;s progress and recommendations regarding further actions to be taken by the State. These take the form of the &ldquo;Concluding Observations&rdquo; referred to in your question. </p><p>The Concluding Observations were shared with all relevant Departments in 2016. Furthermore, my Department organised Ireland's first Child Summit that year, where the Concluding Observations were discussed with experts, government officials and civil society stakeholders. I would also like to highlight that <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020</i>played an important role in progressing the Committee's recommendations.</p><p>Under the old reporting system, the State&rsquo;s response to the Concluding Observations was incorporated in its next periodic report and was followed by a reply to the list of issues developed by the Committee. However, the State decided to opt-in to the Simplified Reporting Procedure, which is promoted by the UN. Under the new system the State does not prepare an initial state report but its response to the list of issues constitutes the State's party report.  The report needs to take into consideration of the Committee's recommendations put forward in 2016.  The State received the list of issues in November 2020 and will have to submit its reply by October 2021. My department has already commenced engagement with other Departments and will also consult with civil society in relation to the State report. </p><p>I would like to reassure the Deputy that during the preparation of the State report consideration will be given to the last Concluding Observations.</p></reply>

The then Minister appointed an Independent Reviewer to oversee a review of a sample of the files held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) and Tusla. Interviews did not form part of the methodology of this review.</p>  <p>  The Independent Reviewer worked with the AAI and Tusla to identify a sample of files to review to determine if they contain comparable evidence of illegal birth registrations. Records were selected from: adoption agencies; nursing homes which acted as &lsquo;informal adoption agencies&rsquo;; and boarding out services, selected geographically to provide national coverage. </p>  <p>  The report of the Independent Reviewer ('Sampling Review') was submitted to the then Minister in May 2019.  However publication was deferred to avoid encroaching on the work of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters. A copy of the Sampling Review report was provided to the Commission. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Sampling Review report was published yesterday following cabinet approval. A copy of the report is available on my Department's website. </p></reply>

As a result, many mothers effectively had little to no choice other than to put their baby up for adoption.  </p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Commission reviewed a major body of documentary evidence in this regard and that additional records or documentation may simply not exist, to support an effective revisiting of this matter by way of a further Commission or statutory inquiry.  </p>  <p>  It is accepted by all parties that, in the past, adoption was often a secretive practice, carried out without due regard to the rights of those involved. Such practice in adoption reflects wider societal prejudices of the time.  </p>  <p>  Today, the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases, and in every step of the process. Modern day adoption legislation and practice also ensures that the rights of all involved are vindicated, including birth fathers, within the overarching framework of working for the best interests of the child involved.  </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that every record on adoption represents the lives of a number of individuals. There are major ethical issues at play where the reality, identity and family and legal relationships that people have lived their whole lives may be fundamentally undermined. I am also concerned that the records may simply not exist, to effectively revisit adoptions that have taken place.  </p>  <p>  From listening to survivors I believe that what is most important as an immediate priority is access to birth certs and early life information for adoptees. Addressing this issue is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in response to the Commission&rsquo;s Report. It is a priority for myself, the Attorney and the Taoiseach.   </p>  <p>  My Department and I are engaging intensively with the Attorney General to find a solution to the issue of release of birth information, including birth certificates.  Through this engagement with the Attorney, I am hopeful that we will have Heads of Bill by end March/ early April.  This legislation, supported by a strong and supportive information and tracing service, should ensure that any individual with a question about their origins is empowered to access their own records and supported with regard to any related needs. </p></reply>

This will help to offset loss of parental fees for services which are highly reliant on private income. Services will continue to be eligible for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) at enhanced rates and are exempt from the turnover rule. The EWSS has been extended until the end of June.</p><p>In addition, a COVID-19 Impact Support has been introduced as part of the DCEDIY Sustainability Fund.

It has, for example, funded a second year of the free pre-school programme and enabled the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).</p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education Programme (ECCE) programme is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range without cost to parents. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks per year and the programme year runs from September to June each year. Approximately 95% of children participate in the programme prior to commencing primary school.</p><p>The National Childcare Scheme was introduced in November 2019. It offers a statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare. It establishes an equitable and progressive system of universal and income-related subsidies for children up to the age of 15. The NCS derives from the Childcare Support Act 2018 which is the first piece of primary legislation passed in Ireland specifically relating to childcare. The Scheme aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families.</p><p>NCS subsidies are awarded as an hourly rate for a maximum number of hours per week. The maximum number of subsidised hours available to families has increased from September 2020. Parents in work, study or training can now avail of up to 45 subsidised hours of childcare per week. Parents not in work, study or training can avail of up to 20 subsidised hours of childcare per week. The Scheme comprises two types of subsidies:</p><p><b>- Universal Subsidy: </b>All families with children under 3 in registered childcare, or children who are over 3 and have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme, can apply. This subsidy is not means tested, and provides up to &euro;20 per week, or &euro;1,040 per year, off the cost of a registered childcare place.</p><p><b>- Income Assessed:</b>Families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years who are attending registered childcare and who have a reckonable household income (NET) of less than &euro;60,000 can apply for an Income Assessed subsidy. Subsidy rates are tailored based on individual circumstances, such as reckonable family income, child&rsquo;s age and their educational stage. The highest subsidy rate is &euro;5.10 per hour for a baby living in a family with a household income of less than &euro;26,000 per year, or &euro;229 per week. The maximum subsidy for a school age child is &euro;3.75 per hour per week.</p><p>More information on the NCS is available to parents by contacting the Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, or on-line at www.ncs.gov.ie.</p><p>First 5, the whole-of Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, has committed to a doubling of investment in early learning and childcare in the decade to 2028. In the context of this increased investment, a key project to address affordability is the development of a new funding model. An Expert Group is leading on this work.</p><p>Extensive research has already been commissioned to inform the Expert Group's work. The Research Partner, Frontier Economics, have so far produced and published five working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues entitled: &ldquo;International Comparisons of Fees, Staff Wages and Public Investment in Early Learning and Care&rdquo;; &ldquo;International Approaches to Funding Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare to Reduce Costs for Parents&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Mechanisms to Control Fees Charged to Parents for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare&rdquo;.  The research identifies international practice and learning that will be of value for the reform of the funding model in Ireland.</p><p>The recommendations of the Expert Group will be made in Autumn 2021 and will set out how the additional funding pledged in First 5 can deliver optimally for children, families and the State. Further information on the progress of this work, and the working papers published to date, can be found at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie.</p></reply>

In the early phase when on-site activities were suddenly suspended this was achieved through a rapid shift to emergency remote learning. Over time a blended model of learning has become the dominant mode with varying levels of onsite and online delivery aligned to public health advice and to the needs of different disciplines and different learner cohorts.</p>  <p>  Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required for education activities that cannot be held remotely.  In January 2021, the sector rapidly adjusted again to the prevailing public health situation by moving the vast majority of their provision online.  </p>  <p>  COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead (published February 23) has not changed the status of Level 5 measures for adult and further and higher education. Using COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead and the Level 5 measures as a guide, higher and further Education should remain primarily online. Institutions and providers continue to carefully balance necessary onsite activities with prevailing public health advice, accepting that levels of time critical activity will fluctuate as the academic year and programmes progress.  </p>  <p>  It is important to provide, in so far as is feasible with an unpredictable public health situation, clear and hopeful messages to students and learners in relation to their expectations for the next academic year to inform their decision making.  When the immediate challenges that the current restrictions are creating are mitigated there will be scope to begin planning for the new academic year and planning for a return to on-site learning.

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs. Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Therefore I do not have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  There will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. Even for students whose path into higher education may not be what they originally planned, there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.</p></reply>

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely. </p>  <p>  From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p>  <p>  - teaching and learning, </p>  <p>  - assessment, and </p>  <p>  - qualifications. </p>  <p>  This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p>  <p>  In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession. </p>  <p>  Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers at a local and regional level. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. </p>  <p>  While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary. </p>  <p>  The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements. It is in this context that QQI has been asked, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue. These engagements are ongoing and are focused on identifying solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements serve to facilitate dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care. </p>  <p>  Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course. </p></reply>

We published our Statement of Strategy for the 2021-2023 period on March 8. It contains six strategic goals including a goal on inclusion which seeks to &ldquo;support learning for all, recognising the needs of vulnerable learners and the most marginalised, and assist people in access to and progression through higher and further education and training, so as to grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion.&rdquo;</p><p>Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The Further Education and Training (FET) sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those with a disability. FET programmes are available to all learners, including those with an intellectual disability, who meet the eligibility criteria and the guidelines provided for each FET programme. </p><p>Specialist Training Provision (STP) is also available for learners with more complex support needs, and this provision addresses the identified training needs of people with disabilities who are experiencing exclusion and labour market disadvantage in the form of vocational training programmes. Community Education assists learners with a disability to participate in FET provision by adapting course content, resources and teaching methodologies to suit their abilities. </p><p>FET providers are required to offer reasonable accommodations to learners with disabilities, the nature of these accommodations varies depending on the identified needs of individual learners. FET provision is available across the country in every county. Most of these programmes are either free of charge or heavily subsidised. Details of FET courses are available at <i>www.fetchcourses.ie</i>or through the Adult Education Guidance Service in the learner&rsquo;s local ETB. This service is free of charge and open to anyone over the age of 18. Local ETBs can provide advice on all education and training options, as well as additional supports that are available to learners, including for learners with a disability. </p><p>SOLAS, the national Further Education and Training authority is currently overseeing an independent evaluation of SPT. The purpose of the evaluation is to examine the quality, effectiveness, on-going relevance and overall value of vocational training that is currently delivered by specialist training providers, and to propose any recommendations for future practice.</p><p>Students who meet eligibility criteria and are attending approved courses can access supports such as the SUSI grant scheme. The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) is the principal funding source for students with disabilities in further and higher education. The fund is available to students with disabilities, including Autism, attending both further and higher education courses. Students attending approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK, and the EU are also eligible for support.  The purpose of the FSD is to provide students with a disability with the necessary assistance to enable them to access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. </p><p>I recently approved a number of initiatives under the FSD aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p><p>One of my priorities is to support learning for all. I want the tertiary education system to develop and grow its supports for vulnerable learners, learners with disabilities, under-represented groups and the most marginalised. I want learners to engage with and complete their education journey while recognising that some learners will need additional supports to help them achieve their full potential. </p><p>My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review; to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, how we can support different providers in working together and learning from each other, and examining what is scalable from institutional-level approaches.  </p></reply>

The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p></reply>

I am aware of the important contribution made by this sector and of the challenges that are being encountered given the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers.</p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and sectorial representatives of staff, students and providers. </p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for English language education providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector. In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. This temporary scheme was expected to be in place for an initial 12-week period. However, recognising the circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, the Government agreed that the TWSS would remain in place until the end of August 2020. Following the conclusion of the TWSS, it has been superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which continues to provide payroll support to businesses. In addition to the subsidy that is being provided via the EWSS, this scheme also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI. </p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices. A full list of these supports and related information is available for providers here: <i>.  </i></p></reply>

Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs including dealing with policy and procedure in relation to fee collection.  My Department therefore has no role in relation to such matters.</p>  <p>  However, I am very aware of the difficulties facing students during this pandemic.  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all students to engage with their institution to discuss any issues in relation to their course, including fees.</p>  <p>  I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 2020/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p>  <p>  Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.  </p>  <p>  Students experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Office of the institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

For the 2020/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. However, if a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on the current year (2020) and they may also be asked to provide evidence of the current year&rsquo;s (2020) income. </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations for the 2021/22 academic year will be published towards the end of March/early April 2021. The opening of SUSI's online grant application system will coincide with the publication of the scheme. Grant applications are submitted online via www.susi.ie. Further information in relation to student grant assistance is also available from this website. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874. </p>  <p>  A review of the Student Grant Scheme in 2020 (following the impact of COVID-19) was committed to as part of the Programme for Government. This Review is currently being undertaken. It will document the impact of Covid-19 on the Scheme and outline a number of recommendations for consideration by the end of Quarter 1, 2021. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the &euro;168m funding package of for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted for decision as expeditiously as possible. If any further documentation is required, it will be requested from the person in due course.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.</p><p>It is not possible to provide the value of criminal legal aid by county under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for each of the years 2018 to 2020. This information is not readily available and could not be compiled without disproportionate use of staff resources. </p><p>Expenditure on the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for each of the years 2018 to 2020 was as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;62.5million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;62.9 million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;61.7 million</td>    </tr> </table> The amount of legal aid paid to Solicitors, Junior Counsel and Senior Counsel under the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for each of years 2018 to 2020 was as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>ExpenditureSolicitors</th>       <th>ExpenditureJunior Counsel</th>       <th>ExpenditureSenior Counsel</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;35,061,481</td>       <td>&euro;13,140,588</td>       <td>&euro;11,433,767</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;36,652,929</td>       <td>&euro;13,900,466</td>       <td>&euro;9,787,599</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;34,217,662</td>       <td>&euro;13,829,488</td>       <td>&euro;9,408,319</td>    </tr> </table> As indicated, criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate. Figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid or of individuals who were granted criminal legal aid. The Courts Service has informed my Department that the number of legal aid certificates granted in the District Court in each of the years 2018 to 2020 was as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th><div>2018</div></th>       <th><div>2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of criminal legal aid certificates granted in the District Court</td>       <td><div>72,674</div></td>       <td><div>79,346</div></td>       <td><div>73,611</div></td>    </tr> </table> <b>Criminal Assets Bureau Legal Aid Scheme (CAB) </b></p><p>The CAB Scheme, which came into effect from 2 April 1998, is applicable to persons who are respondents and/or defendants in any court proceedings brought by, or in the name of, the Criminal Assets Bureau, including court proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, the Revenue Acts or the Social Welfare Acts and applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred from my Department to the Legal Aid Board on 1 January 2014.

It provides that where a person is detained in a Garda Station for the purpose of the investigation of an offence and s/he has a legal entitlement to consult with a solicitor and the person&rsquo;s means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for such consultation, that consultations with solicitors will be paid for by the State. The Scheme, now known as the Garda Station Legal Advice Revised Scheme, was extended in May 2014 to include attendance of a solicitor at a formal interview between the Garda&iacute; and the detainee.  The responsibility for the administration of the Scheme was transferred from my Department to the Legal Aid Board on 1 October 2011.<b></b>Expenditure in each of the years 2018 to 2020 was as follows:  <b></b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;1,947,869</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;1,714,245</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;1,980,621</td>    </tr> </table> <b>District Court Counsel Scheme  </b></p><p>The Scheme was introduced in October 2009 following a Supreme Court decision to allow a judge to assign counsel in the District Court to a defendant because of the gravity of the charge and complexity of the case, as well as any other exceptional circumstances. </p><p>Following a High Court Judicial Review case in 2016, the Scheme was revised to allow a Circuit Court Judge grant legal aid in respect of a District Court Appeal. </p><p>Expenditure under the District Court Counsel Scheme was as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;261,606</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;452,445</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;518,601</td>    </tr> </table> <b>The Legal Aid - Custody Issues Scheme (formerly known as the Attorney General&rsquo;s Legal Aid Scheme) </b></p><p>The Legal Aid - Custody Issues Scheme<b></b>provides payment for legal representation in the High Court and the Supreme Court for certain types of cases not covered by civil legal aid or the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.

However, to be of assistance to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Legal Aid Board on foot of which the following information is provided.  </p><p>Civil legal aid and advice is provided primarily through a network of law centres by solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board.  There are 30 full time and 12 part-time law centres. Arising from the enactment of the International Protection Act 2015, the Legal Aid Board integrated the Refugee Legal Service into its main law centre network.  Specific law centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway currently include an international protection speciality.  International protection is one of many services provided by those law centres.  The Legal Aid Board also engages private solicitors to provide services in international protection cases.  A substantial portion of the Board&rsquo;s international protection cases are handled by private practitioners. </p><p>With the introduction of the single application procedure following the enactment of the International Protection Act 2015, the Board established and maintains a panel of solicitors who are willing to provide services to persons who have been granted legal services for the purpose of: advice and/or representation in relation to an application under the International Protection Act 2015 for asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain; and for all relevant matters covered by the International Protection Act 2015, the Refugee Act 1996 and the Immigration Act 1999.</p><p>Since 2017, referrals to private solicitors have occurred at the outset of the International Protection process to ensure applicants receive legal advice at the earliest stage.  Prior to the commencement of the Act, referrals more typically took place at the appeals stage.</p><p>The following table shows the case expenditure (not including pay or operationalcosts) in relation to the provision of legal aid and advice in the area of international protection, as provided by the Legal Aid Board.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>Jan 2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Non-Pay Expenditure </td>       <td>&euro;75,356 </td>       <td>&euro;552,787 </td>       <td>&euro;1,050,035 </td>       <td>&euro;1,582,789 </td>       <td>&euro;1,243,907 </td>       <td>&euro;55,254</td>    </tr> </table> The Legal Aid Board is included in the review being undertaken to identify how processing and general supports to applicants in the International Protection process can be enhanced. They will be engaging with my Department to guide future funding considerations as set out in the recent White Paper to End Direct Provision and to establish a new International Protection Support Service.</p><p>In Budget 2021, I provided an increased provision of over &euro;2 million for the Legal Aid Board bringing its total funding to &euro;44.6 million for this year, a 6% increase. This will enable the Board to recruit additional staff and meet other costs to enhance delivery of all of its services across the country. </p></reply>

As part of Budget 2021, the government has provided a record &euro;1.952 billion to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to tackle crime and to build community resilience against crime. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that I recently met with the Garda Commissioner where we discussed, amongst other topics, violent crime in the inner city of Dublin. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a comprehensive policing plan in place in the north inner city which will see high visibility patrols carried out on a daily basis, with a particular focus on areas where public order and related offending has recently taken place.</p><p>In respect of drug related crime, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.  Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities including in Dublin. It also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners.  </p><p>The Government has in place the National Drugs Strategy, &quot;<i>Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025</i>&quot;. The Strategy is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level. </p><p>The Strategy includes an action which specifically relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN) to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013.</p><p>I am informed that funding in Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), North Central Division for Garda Youth Diversion Projects and activities has increased from &euro;566,236 in 2018 to an allocation of &euro;1.2m in 2021. Alongside this increase in funding, the currently funded projects are being provided with increased staffing and support to increase their catchment areas to cover the majority of the DMR, North Central area. This is part of the overall objective of my Department to increase and develop the Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP) network to ensure access to all young people that need the service nationally. <b></b></p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that the issue of youth crime is addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which I intend to finalise and bring to Government shortly.  This will consider the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This will include early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  </p><p>Minister of State James Browne has also established a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, which will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.</p><p>It is worth noting that the North Inner City Electoral Area is one of three locations (along with Waterford and Longford) due to pilot the Department&rsquo;s new Local Community Safety Partnership approach. </p><p>The Partnerships will bring together residents, community representatives, business interests, councillors, local authorities and State services such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the HSE to devise and implement the Local Community Safety Plans. This approach is aimed at bringing all of the key services together with the communities they serve to jointly identify and tackle the problems facing their particular area. A community &ndash; such as the North Inner City &ndash; often has a range of resources available and the Partnership can act as a means to bring those resources together, and identify and address gaps where necessary. Cormac &Oacute; Donnch&uacute; was recently appointed Chair to the Dublin North Inner City partnership. A process of community engagement will commence this month with a view to having the partnership established in April. </p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that incidents of conflict can range from minor incidents or disagreements amongst prisoners, which are easily resolved through dialogue and communications, to more serious incidents including violent incidents where a more physical intervention is required. </p><p>De-escalation and communication are major components of the conflict resolution training given to all prison officers.  They play a significant role in how they carry out their duties.  Many incidents are resolved, where de-escalation, communication and the inter-personal skills of prison officers are used and prevent the need for a physical response. It is the case that many of these incidents would not be routinely recorded. </p><p>The use of a physical intervention is governed by Prison Rule 93 which states &ldquo;w<i>here, for the purpose of maintaining or restoring good order or safe or secure custody, it is deemed necessary to use force in relation to a Prisoner, such force only as is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve that purpose shall be used&rdquo;. </i>Physical interventions involving the use of force are governed by the Irish Prison Service Use of Force Standard Operating Procedures which states that that &ldquo;<i>the Use of Force should only be undertaken as a last resort, after all other attempts to resolve or de-escalate the situation have failed</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>The Use of Force Continuum, set out in this Standard Operating Procedure, defines the appropriate response by an officer to varying levels of behaviour of prisoners. It is not necessary to progress through each stage, and the individual needs to decide on the appropriate actions, bearing in mind prison rule 93, as the situation demands. In compliance with Irish Prison Service Policy, de-escalation attempts are made throughout the varying stages.</p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that from, 1 March 2020 to 1 March 2021, 118 recruit prison officers received conflict resolution training in the Irish Prison Service College. In the same period 293 established prison officers received additional conflict resolution training as part of their continuous professional development. This figure is reduced from the previous year due to Covid - 19 measures which impacted on training.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made with the Courts Service and I am advised as follows.</p>  <p>  The court poor box is a non-statutory system used to impose a financial charge on a defendant to be used for a charitable purpose, usually instead of imposing a criminal conviction. While each court of first instance (High, Circuit and District) has used the poor box system on occasion, it is mainly used in the District Court where the judge may order the defendant to pay a donation into the court poor box in lieu of another penalty.  It usually arises where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence.</p>  <p>  Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Generally, charities are the recipients of poor box contributions, but the decision is solely at the discretion of the judge (who is independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law).</p>  <p>  The Justice Plan 2021, which I published recently, commits to commencing a policy review of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill 2014 in consultation with the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service. It is intended that the proposed legislation will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system. The legislation will abolish the Court Poor Box and replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The fund would provide for a fair, equitable and transparent system of reparation that will apply only to minor offences dealt with by the District Court.

These Regulations give effect to Directive 2013/33/EU of 26 June 2013, laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast), and came into operation on 30 June 2018. The Regulations provided access to the labour market for an applicant who has not received a first instance decision within 9 months of making an international protection application. </p>  <p>  The European Communities (Reception Conditions) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 52 of 2021) amended the labour market access permission provisions of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, to reduce the timeframe for labour market access from 9 to 6 months and to extend the validity of a labour market permission from 6 to 12 months.  These Regulations make statutory provision for the new labour market access measures that I announced in January 2021.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the international protection applicant themselves to apply for a labour market access permission. An application cannot be made on their behalf by a prospective employer. However, a prospective employer may assist the applicant, particularly where language difficulties may arise. Employers&rsquo; responsibilities are laid out in Regulation 14 of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018. These include an obligation to keep certain records and to inform the Labour Market Access Unit (LMAU) of my Department when a permission holder is employed or ceases to be employed. This is done in cooperation with the permission holder using the LMA5 form.</p>  <p>  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the LMAU currently have limited access to the office and postal applications are unfortunately severely delayed. For this reason, all applicants are advised to email their application to LMAUapplications@justice.ie. </p>  <p>  To renew a permission, the applicant should submit the LMA4 form, a copy of their in date Temporary Residence Certificate (TRC) and, if employed, an LMA5 form to LMAUapplications@justice.ie These forms should be submitted one month before the applicant&rsquo;s permission expires to allow time for processing. The LMAU are currently processing emailed applications received approximately two weeks ago.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may also be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. This included &euro;8 million for the new Courts Modernisation Programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a socially distanced and safe environment. A significant priority for my Department and the Courts Service in the years ahead will be to significantly invest in digital technology, to transform the experience of practitioners and of court users.</p><p>I am pleased to say the Courts have continued to sit on priority matters in the areas of family law, criminal matters (especially cases involving people in custody), bail and urgent injunctions.  Prior to the latest imposition of Level 5 restrictions, additional capacity was added to the courts infrastructure to facilitate the holding of numbers of courts close to pre-Covid levels. While every effort has been made to facilitate as much court business as possible unfortunately significant backlogs have been accrued in regard to certain case categories. The Government endeavours to ensure our courts continue to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.  My Department is in constant contact with the Courts Service and has maintained a schedule of regular interactions with the Courts Service throughout the pandemic to support the Service in addressing the issues that have arisen during this crisis, including where backlogs have arisen.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions  However, the Courts Service has advised that they continue to work with the Judiciary to prioritise business and the holding of courts to address areas of concern. </p><p>The Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely to adapt to changed circumstances and innovated through the use of technology to maintain the highest level of activity possible.  This has seen the first remote courts being conducted over video technology as well as an expansion of the use of videolink technology particularly with the Prison Service. This investment and commitment to continuing to serve has enabled the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to continue with its throughput of cases and supported the other jurisdictions keep many lists up to date. In other jurisdictions, such as the High Court, the increased use of remote technology has led to an increase in cases heard.  Investments continues to be made in these areas to further improve services and the Courts Service is currently rolling out videolink facilities to 43 additional courtrooms across the country and is looking to enhance the infrastructure used in virtual courts. </p><p>Further investment is being made in hiring Croke Park to expand courtroom capacity in Dublin and using external venues in order that juries can be empanelled safely for Criminal trials.  These measures are temporarily suspended during the current heightened restrictions but will be recommenced once it is safe to do so. Criminal trials can now take place in an increasing number of trial venues throughout Ireland. Public health guidelines on social distancing initially limited the number of county town courthouses that could hold jury trials but through adaption of courtrooms and the use of technology the number of trial venues has increased from 8 to 16.Criminal trials can now be hosted in the following venues outside Dublin: Carrick On Shannon, Castlebar, Cork, Drogheda, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Limerick, Monaghan, Mullingar, Sligo, Trim, Tullamore, Waterford and Wexford. </p><p>The Courts have demonstrated an ability to resume a high level of activity immediately once society begins to reopen.  Through staggering of court lists, positive callovers of cases on hand and the introduction of new people management procedures, Courts began to operate at near full capacity in the summer and autumn of last year and good progress had been made in dealing with arrears that built up during latest period of restrictions.  The Courts Service expect similar results will be possible once current restrictions ease and continue to work closely with the Judiciary to identify areas of work that require particular attention.  Work is on-going to manage day to day issues and to plan for reopening, including regular engagement with key stakeholders such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to summonses and with the legal profession.  </p></reply>

My Department has consistently adopted a pragmatic approach in this area in the context of Covid-19.   </p>  <p>  When a Deportation Order is made and served, the person concerned is legally obliged to remove themselves from the State and to remain outside of the State. Many people comply with this but may not notify the immigration authorities that they have done so. Accordingly, it is not always possible for the Immigration Service or the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to know whether or not a Deportation Order has been complied with. It is only when a person served with such an Order fails to remove themselves from the State that the issue of enforcement of the Order by the GNIB arises.</p>  <p>  A detailed consideration of all aspects of a person's case will have been carried out before a decision is made to grant them permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order. This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues. </p>  <p>  If a Deportation Order is subsequently made, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.  In making a revocation request a person can raise new or changed circumstances in their case including in relation to their country of origin.  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that fully informed decisions can be made at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

That is reflected in the Programme for Government itself, in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform, which was launched last December, and in the Justice Plan 2021, which I published recently.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Insurance Reform sets out 66 actions designed to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations. The Action Plan includes actions to be taken by my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The implementation of the Action Plan is being overseen by the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.</p>  <p>  With regard to personal injuries guidelines, the Deputy will be aware that the Judicial Council Act 2019 provides, inter alia, for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.

The Inspector's key role is to carry out regular inspections of prisons. The Office is required to inspect the twelve prisons in Ireland to examine the treatment and conditions for prisoners and for staff. The Inspector may also investigate any matter arising out of the management or operation of a prison and submit a report on any such investigation. </p>  <p>  In late 2020, the Office began the process of preparing an inspection schedule in line with the 2020 Framework for the Inspection of Irish Prisons and the 2020-2023 Strategic Plan. Inspections for 2021 were to include three general inspections and one thematic inspection, with four inspection reports to be submitted to me by the conclusion of 2021. </p>  <p>  However, as you will appreciate, as of late January 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its current state of transmission in and beyond prisons, the Office has determined it should suspend its 2021 general inspection programme until such point that a full inspection team can enter the prison safely. </p>  <p>  The Inspector is cognisant of the need to provide oversight of prisons and to inform me of the situation for prisoners and staff working in prisons during the pandemic. In response to this need, the Inspector embarked on a COVID-19 focused inspection schedule designed to assess COVID-19 thematic issues in line with human rights standards and the Framework Focus Areas (Safety &amp;amp; Security, Respect &amp;amp; Dignity, Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing, Rehabilitation &amp;amp; Development and Resettlement). The first COVID-19 Thematic Inspection visit has recently taken place in Mountjoy Prison from 1 to 4 March 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am informed that COVID-19 Thematic Inspections will be complemented by ongoing COVID-19 telephone communications with each of the prisons in Ireland. I am advised that the Inspectorate will carry out telephone calls to prisons at least every two weeks to take account of the status of the aforementioned Framework Focus Areas. The Inspectorate will also distribute an online survey for prison staff across the prison estate. The objective of the survey will be to gain an understanding of how prison staff are handling challenges associated with COVID-19.

When making such decisions, the Government considers the expert public health advices of NPHET to tackle the disease.</p>  <p>  I have reviewed the interim visa measures introduced on South American countries and South Africa and have decided to use my powers, under Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2004, to maintain these visa requirements after 5 March and until no longer needed for public health reasons. I have not introduced any further visa requirements since 17 February 2021. Further visa requirements may be introduced to other non-EEA countries in the future, where they are deemed necessary and appropriate, to support public health measures approved by the Government.</p></reply>

The measures and arrangement for physical visits will be informed by Public Health advice and will take account of a number of factors including visiting capacity, the need for continued social distancing and external factors such as the level of infection in the community at that time.  </p>  <p>  It is likely that all visitors will continue to be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedures which have been in place since March 2020 and visitors will requested not to attend if they have any symptoms, have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing, if they themselves have tested positive for Covid-19 and have yet to be cleared by their doctor, or if they have been abroad in the preceding fortnight. </p>  <p>  Details on the procedures and arrangements will be announced by the Irish Prison Service, in advance of the return of visits.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, the Irish Prison Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and a new video visit system was introduced which has allowed families to continue to support those in custody. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that when physical visits recommence, they will also retain the option of video calls for prisoners.  </p></reply>

They are not deemed inadmissible merely by coming from one of these countries. </p><p>If the recommendation of an International Protection Officer is that the applicant should be given neither a refugee declaration nor a subsidiary protection declaration and includes the finding that they are from a safe country of origin, an appeal can be lodged in writing within 10 working days to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT). Unless the IPAT considers it is not in the interests of justice to do so, it shall make its decision in relation to the appeal without holding an oral hearing.</p><p>Part 18 of the Brexit Omnibus Act 2020, which was commenced at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020, amends the International Protection Act 2015, to enable the Minister for Justice to designate a country as a Safe Third Country, where certain conditions are met in that country including:</p><p>- life and liberty are not threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion;</p><p>- the principle of non-refoulement is respected; and</p><p>- the possibility exists to request refugee status and if found to be a refugee to receive protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention.</p><p>Where a person arrives here from a country designated as a Safe Third Country and claims international protection their application can be determined as inadmissible and the person returned to the safe third county for their application for protection to be considered there. This is in line with the EU Procedures Directive (2005/85/EU).</p><p>Before an application can be determined as inadmissible, the third country must be considered safe for the person concerned including that they will not be subjected to the death penalty, torture, or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and they have a sufficient connection with that country such that it would be reasonable for them to be returned there.</p><p>Following the United Kingdom&rsquo;s exit from the EU and an examination of the necessary criteria, the International Protection Act 2015 (Safe Third Country) Order 2020, came into effect from 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020.  The Order designates the UK as a safe third country for the purpose of the International Protection Act 2015, and enables the Minister for Justice to determine an application for international protection as inadmissible where the person has arrived in the State from the UK and where the relevant criteria are met.  </p></reply>

The Coroners Society of Ireland agreed that all inquests in the State were not to be held in January given public health considerations under Level 5 restrictions.  </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the delay in holding inquests is causing distress for families and officials from my Department are liaising with the Courts Service on this matter. The Courts Service works closely with coroners across the country to facilitate inquests and will do so once again when restrictions ease.</p>  <p>  In response to the pandemic, I understand that some coroners are holding, what are referred to as &lsquo;documentary inquests&rsquo; or remote inquests, which require very small numbers of attendees and take place with the agreement of families. Larger inquests, requiring multiple witnesses, are being rescheduled to a later date.  </p>  <p>  The revised Government plan in relation to Covid-19, published last week, refers to the need for each government department to develop sectoral plans to mitigate backlogs, and anticipate pent up demand or unmet needs arising from restrictions. This will build on the new ways of working that have already been brought into place, and will include consideration of the issues in relation to coroners, as appropriate. My Department continues to keep service delivery across the justice sector under review in the context of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department collates and publishes annual statistics on the activities of each coroner. The annual statistics on how many deaths were reported to coroners, how many Post-Mortem examinations were ordered by coroners, and how many inquests were held by coroners can be found under the "Publications" tab on www.coroners.ie.  My Department is currently in the process of compiling the statistics in respect of 2020, and when complete, these will be published on the website. </p></reply>

My Department has contributed to, and participated in, the large scale cross-Government communications programme which has been running since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This has involved supporting and amplifying Government and public health messaging through both our internal and external communications channels. There has been no spending by my Department on advertising directly related to COVID-19 during the period in question. </p><p>While not specifically a campaign to raise awareness of COVID-19, since March 2020 my Department has been running the important &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; campaign. This purpose of this campaign is to reassure victims of domestic abuse that support services from State agencies and the voluntary sector are still available and accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of what level of restrictions are in place. </p><p>In addition to reminding victims of domestic abuse that help is &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo;, the campaign also reminds anyone concerned for their safety that the restrictions on movement do not apply to people at risk or who are removing themselves from a domestic abuse situation.</p><p>To date the Department has spent &euro;397,944.36 on the Still Here campaign. The campaign so far has included two major media bursts, 16 April &ndash; 3 May 2020 and Oct 26 to Nov 8 2020. As requested by the Deputy, I have provided further breakdown of that spend by TV and Radio media outlet for both bursts.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Vaccination of those aged 70 and older (in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74) began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>In relation to the categories of very high risk and high risk conditions, this list is not exhaustive. It may also include people who have been classed as at very high risk, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of need. It is recommended that people discuss this with their treating physician who is in the best position to give appropriate advice.</p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p></reply>

This evidence review included a review of relevant studies in relation to Ivermectin.</p><p>Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions. However, the HIQA noted the low quality of the evidence available including the high risk of bias, small sample sizes and short durations of follow-up different trials and advised that results from these studies should not be used to inform decision-making with respect to effectiveness. </p><p>The HIQA&rsquo;s overall finding was that there is currently insufficient evidence of either effectiveness or safety to support the use of any pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting to reduce the risk of progression to severe disease in patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 unless as part of an ongoing monitored clinical trial. Furthermore, no evidence was identified for the effectiveness or safety of any non-pharmaceutical intervention in the community setting. </p><p>As confirmed by the HIQA&rsquo;s COVID-19 Expert Advisory Group: (), evidence regarding the effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatments intended for systemic use, must be subject to the highest standards of rigour. Where a pharmaceutical intervention is recommended in the absence of appropriate supportive evidence, there is a significant potential for harm to the patient. Whereas this risk of harm may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. the intervention poses minimal risk, or the setting involves patients with high potential to gain due to almost certain risk of severe adverse consequences in absence of any intervention) this is less likely to be the case in the setting of mild disease, where a great number of otherwise well patients would potentially receive the intervention. </p><p>The HIQA has also advised my Department that several international health technology assessment or guideline development organisations have specifically reviewed the evidence to date on ivermectin in COVID-19 and have cautioned or advised against the use of ivermectin outside the setting of clinical trials on the basis of the current evidence. The HIQA has also advised that the pharmaceutical company MSD (Merck, USA), which holds a license in the USA for the use of ivermectin as an antiparasitic agent, on 4th February 2021 published a statement including the following: </p><p><i>&ldquo;It is important to note that, to-date, our analysis has identified: </i></p><p><i>- No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; </i></p><p><i>- No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and;</i></p><p><i>- A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies. </i></p><p><i>We do not believe that the data available support the safety and efficacy of ivermectin beyond the doses and populations indicated in the regulatory agency-approved prescribing information.&rdquo; </i></p><p>I trust that the above information satisfactorily addresses your question. </p></reply>

However, a number of legal issues were identified which necessitated further consideration. Since services under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019, there has been a limited number of reports of protests or other actions relating to termination of pregnancy.  This is an extremely positive development, suggesting that termination of pregnancy services have bedded in relatively smoothly to date and are becoming a normal part of the Irish healthcare system, in line with Government policy.</p>  <p>  However, where problems do arise with protests outside health care services, there is existing public order legislation in place to protect people accessing services, employees working in the service and local residents. The Department of Health has previously liaised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around safe access to termination of pregnancy services, and the Garda National Protective Services Bureau issued a notice to all Garda Stations raising awareness about the issue. The notice directed that any protests be monitored, and breaches of existing law dealt with. </p>  <p>  The Department has provided information on existing public order and other relevant legislation to the HSE for appropriate distribution. </p></reply>

To be eligible, applicants must be directly involved in delivering care to patients or clients in a nursing context.  For example, healthcare assistants and multi-task attendants are eligible for the sponsorship scheme.  The number of sponsorships available each year is determined by the Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director in the HSE.  This scheme commenced in 2002 and 30 sponsorships have been awarded each year since 2017. </p><p>While in the scheme, the students retain their substantive posts.  The students' basic salary is paid for the duration of their nursing or midwifery degree programme and they are expected to return to their post outside of the academic semesters for the duration of the programme.</p><p>After completing the degree programme, graduates must register as a nurse or midwife with the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI).  They are also asked to sign a service agreement and commit to work as a registered nurse or midwife in the Irish health services for a period of 5 years after registration.</p><p>Further information on the requirements and application process of the sponsorship scheme can be found on .</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in front-line services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Vaccination of those aged 70 and older (in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74) began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death.  In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus.  Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link:</p><p>The ongoing review process will continue to look at the other priority groups yet to be vaccinated, along with the competing needs of those working or living in high-risk situations, carers who deliver essential services to highly dependent individuals in the home setting, and those who are socially vulnerable/disadvantaged.</p></reply>

The importance of continued social interaction of residents and their families cannot be overstated and every effort should be made, in line with public health advice, to ensure that these interactions continue, including through window visits. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>Data indicates that 104 nursing homes are actively dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak.  Noting that on 6th   March approximately 525 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, the level of risk, including to residents of nursing homes remains high.  The public health advice remains clear, as noted in the statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team on 24th February &ldquo;Given the increased transmissibility of the virus now, we must continue to limit our social contacts and do all we can to starve this disease of opportunities to spread&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents.  Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p>  <p>  I recently wrote to all nursing home providers, through HIQA&rsquo;s communication portal, to emphasise the importance of adopting a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the important role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents&rsquo; overall health and wellbeing.  The importance of ensuring that visits take place to the greatest extent possible, in line with public health guidance and risk assessments was reiterated and providers were encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone to calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead, published on 23rd February, recognises that the challenge of balancing protective health measures and normal living has been particularly important in the context of visitations to long-term residential care settings (LTRC). LTRC visiting guidance has remained under ongoing review throughout the pandemic.  In light of the advanced stage of rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in LTRCs for both residents and staff, the NPHET (the National Public Health Emergency Team) has requested that the HSE progress a process for considering the scope and application of LTRC visiting restrictions in the context of the Framework of Restrictive Measures, having regard to international and national evidence, the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the level of disease in the community.  The HSE are finalising this process. </p></reply>

At the beginning of last week, Ireland had received approximately 520,000 vaccine doses and by the end of the week approximately 500,000 doses were administered, a measure of the programme&rsquo;s efficiency.  Vaccines continue to be administered very quickly after their arrival into the country.  At the moment, vaccine administration is limited only by the supply of approved vaccines and that is dependent on manufacturers meeting their supply commitments.    </p>  <p>  As with all Vaccine Administration Sites, consumables (needles, syringes, sharps bin etc.) are delivered separately to vaccines. Planning is predicated on the approach that consumables will be delivered in advance of the vaccine delivery and every effort is made to ensure that this is the case.  However, I am aware of a small number of incidents where consumables have not arrived in advance of the vaccine delivery. </p>  <p>  In relation to General Practitioners, the position is that at the conclusion of the first phase roll-out of the programme last weekend, the HSE has confirmed that the majority of patients aged 85 years and over have received their first dose of the vaccine as scheduled. GPs have also begun administration of vaccine to people aged 80-84. In total over 1,300 GP practices, representing in excess of 3,000 GPs and their Practice Teams have delivered over 90,000 vaccines by last weekend and a further 37,000 vaccines being distributed this week (w/c 8 March). The programme has also involved a number of large-scale GP clinics, which have taken place in the Helix DCU, MTU in Cork and Merlin Park Galway with over 1,500 over 85&rsquo;s receiving the vaccine at these locations.</p>  <p>  There are a very small number of practices, less than 30, who are due to receive first delivery this week for their over 85s and it is also intended to commence the vaccination of those who are homebound as arrangements have been put in place in conjunction with GP&rsquo;s, local community teams and the National Ambulance Service and will commence this week and also patients in our acute hospitals.  The HSE has acknowledge that there were problems with communication with GPs generally and that some issues have arisen with the distribution of vaccines to some GP practices over the last week, and steps are being taken to improve this situation also.</p>  <p>  As is well known, the vaccination programme is limited internationally by the supply of vaccine and our programme to date has ensured that all available vaccine is distributed and administered as quickly as possible.  The supply required for the completion of the programme by mid-May remains on target.  However, due to a re-profiling of the Moderna vaccine delivery schedule, the total vaccine doses available for distribution in the coming weeks is now slightly less.  The available vaccine supply is approximately 15% less than the required amount to meet the total over-80 cohort.  This means GPs may not receive the total order for these coming weeks but, in all instances, GPs will be advised on the amounts they will receive and any shortfall in vaccine for the over-80 age group will be allocated in the next order and so on through March with a significant ramp-up in vaccine delivery in April as increased supplies arrive in Ireland.  Unfortunately, these supply issues are outside of our control.  However, if any additional supply becomes available, this will be provided to General Practitioners at the earliest opportunity. Importantly, the HSE expects that the totality of the over-70s programme will be completed within the original timeframe of mid-May.</p></reply>

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p>  <p>  On 23rd February, 2021, the Government published it's updated plan for managing Covid-19 - COVID-19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead.  This three part plan reviews the learnings from our experience to date, considers the enormous impacts our efforts to manage and suppress the disease have had on our economy and on our society and sets out a cautious and measured approach to the easing of restrictions over the coming months. </p>  <p>  The public health measures in place at any level of the Plan recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.  </p>  <p>  Under the current restrictions at level 5, people are asked to stay at home as much as possible unless they have a "reasonable excuse" for leaving, which includes for exercise with 5km of home. Further information is available here - www.gov.ie/en/publication/2dc71-level-5/#travel-restrictions.</p>  <p>  S.I. No. 701 of 2020 Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No. 10) Regulations 2020, as amended by S.I. No. 4 of 2021, S.I. No. 29 of 2021 and S.I.

In 2021, all health services continue to face restrictions, as the health system continues to need to prioritise treating those with COVID-19 and rolling out the vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  The closure of the GMHS in 2020 related primarily to the necessary redeployment of increasing numbers of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties.  During the interval in which the GMHS was closed, significant efforts were made to maintain service provision by referring patients to alternative services in Dublin.   </p>  <p>  Currently, CHO6 are continuing to work to reopen the GMHS on a phased basis.  The recruitment of permanent staff is progressing with administration staff in post and IT expansion underway. </p>  <p>  Existing PrEP users are now being seen in the GMHS.  The Clinic&rsquo;s Consultant in Infectious Diseases (Gay Men&rsquo;s Health service (GMHS) and GUIDE Clinic, St James&rsquo;s Hospital) and other doctors are providing virtual consultations. PrEP service users attend GMHS for STI screening and blood testing.  Those with diagnosed STIs or requiring Hepatitis and/or HPV vaccination continue to be treated in GMHS also.</p>  <p>  In summary, a phased reintroduction of STI services is currently under way in GMHS.  All services are being and will continue to be delivered in accordance with current Public Health COVID guidelines. Officials from the Department of Health and the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme are in regular contact with CHO6 to monitor progress regarding the phased reopening of the GMHS. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie  and www.sexualwellbeing.ie  are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services.</p></reply>

Service users that usually received their supports from these locations are now either receiving supports at another location or receiving outreach or home-based supports.</p><p>Day services re-opened at 39% capacity at service locations throughout August and early September of 2020, and by end of January 2021 this had increased to 51%. The combination of supports in the location, outreach supports, and remote supports provides an overall quantum of support to service users of over 60% at the end of January.  For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions.</p><p>Guidance published by the HSE on 6 January 2021 confirms that day services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction. People with complex medical/ clinical related needs are to remain at home and where possible, to receive the same number of hours support in the home as they had been in receipt of pre-Christmas in day service locations. Providers have been asked to reduce contacts via hubs/bubbles, with dedicated staff for dedicated service users, where possible. Where families are uncomfortable with allowing their family member to return to a day service location, a package of support within available resources will be agreed with the service user and family.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;30 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for day services to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff. This will provide an increase in day services by an average of one day a week for 14,940 people against September 2020 service levels.</p><p>With regard to the COVID 19 vaccine, the COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination. The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for the Minister for Health and further information is available here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/39038-provisional-vaccine-allocation-groups/</i>. </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, Stephen Donnelly TD, Minister for Health announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b44b2-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-vaccine-allocation-strategy/</i>.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and avoiding non-essential travel, until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p><p>As the question also pertains to a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly in relation to the individual case, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.</p><p>Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p><p>This change was approved by Government and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I requested a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny from the Business Committee, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il, and this waiver was granted on 4th February 2021. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session. The Bill will be enacted upon completion of all stages in the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President.</p></reply>

The PrEP programme was launched in November 2019 and funding of &euro;5.4 million was secured in 2020, including allocations for the recruitment of additional staff. The roll-out of the programme continues in 2021. Whilst the PrEP programme remains fully funded, implementation has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>All health services, including STI/HIV/PrEP services, are continuing to face constraints, resulting from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. These include attendance by appointment only, or online as a result of the need to maintain social distancing, and the necessary redeployment of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties, which include testing, contact tracing, vaccination and front-line patient care.</p><p>However, despite Covid-19 related restrictions, the national PrEP programme has continued to expand and over 2,000 individuals, mostly gay men, are currently registered.</p><p>Phone lines, the GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie and www.sexualwellbeing.ie are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved PrEP services.</p><p>Needless to say, funding remains in place for the national PrEP programme and it is hoped that this service can be delivered to its full potential and developed further, once pandemic related constraints on the health service as a whole can be reduced safely.</p><p>With regard to the detailed statistical data sought, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The European Commission was represented by Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, and Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides. Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Andrea Ammon and Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Emer Cooke also attended the meeting and made presentations before EU and EFTA Member States each made an intervention.</p>  <p>  The discussion focussed on the impact of variants on Member States, national testing strategies, and the need for information sharing on the national rollout of COVID-19 vaccination plans.</p>  <p>  During my intervention, I shared Ireland&rsquo;s experience of its testing strategy and exploration of advanced technologies which when guided by scientific evidence will inform the future testing service. I voiced Ireland's support for the objectives of the proposed HERA Incubator, the precursor to the establishment of the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), as well as efforts to increase information-sharing on vaccination rollout and lessons learnt across Member States.</p></reply>

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p><p>Registered providers, (public, voluntary and private) are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaint&rsquo;s procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p><p>The Ombudsman may be contacted at:</p><p>Office of the Ombudsman, 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2, Tel. (01) 639 5600 / Lo-call (1890) 22 30 30 and via e-mail at ombudsman@ombudsman.gov.ie (website is www.ombudsman.ie).</p><p>Separately, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) welcomes information about designated centres for dependent persons, reviews all information about services received and evaluates it against the regulations and standards.  </p><p>Concerns can be communicated to:</p><p>Phone: 021 240 9646</p><p>E-mail: concerns@hiqa.ie</p><p>Postal Address: HIQA, George&rsquo;s Court, Smithfield, Dublin 7, D07 E98Y</p><p>As a regulator HIQA has no legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections and this range of information informs a risk-based approach to regulation.  </p></reply>

The Framework continues to provide an appropriate mechanism to guide decision-making, and it will continue to be supplemented by more detailed sectoral guidance in relation to measures that apply at each level of the Framework.</p><p>On 23rd February, 2021, the Government published the revised plan: Covid 19 Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead. This three part plan reviews the learnings from our experience to date, considers the enormous impacts our efforts to manage and suppress the disease have had on our economy and on our society and sets out a cautious and measured approach to the easing of restrictions over the coming months.</p><p>Information on the revised plan is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/c4876-covid-19-resilience-and-recovery-2021-the-path-ahead/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/ThePathAhead/.</p><p>The public health measures recognise the need to reduce congregation and interactions between people to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others. </p><p>At level 5, all non-essential retail, and all non-essential services must remain closed. Information in relation to the current public health measures in place for essential retail and essential services at level 5 is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/2dc71-level-5/ and www.gov.ie/en/publication/c9158-essential-services/ Funeral and burial services are listed as essential under 'Administrative and Support Activities'. </p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 10) Regulations 2020 Regulation (S.I. 701 of 2020), sets out the relevant businesses or services under the current public health measures.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/39038-provisional-vaccine-allocation-groups/.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. </p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first. </p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>Vaccination of those aged 70 and older (in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74) began in February.</p><p>On the 23<sup>rd</sup>of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. </p><p>In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death.</p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>The NIAC continues to monitor data around this disease and indeed emerging data on effectiveness of vaccines on a rolling basis.</p><p>Further details are available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b44b2-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-vaccine-allocation-strategy/.</p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will now be vaccinated in Group 6.</p></reply>

This is achieved through an on-going monthly performance management process where the HSE reports against the targets set out in the Service Plan. Monthly high-level meetings between management in both organisations are held to discuss on-going or emerging performance issues and to determine actions to resolve and improve areas of concern.  There is also regular engagement between HSE and departmental officials on a wide range of issues to ensure compliance with policy objectives.</p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting list information has been collected and published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) since 2013.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. </p><p>The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p><p>In addition the National Treatment Purchas Fund (NTPF) is currently reviewing strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients, to include, increased use of private hospitals , funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo; see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics, and clinical validation.</p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of measures taken in the context of Covid-19, as well as to address waiting lists. </p><p>The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy has been provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and is outlined in the attached document. This document provides a breakdown of the over 18-month outpatient waiting list, by the time-bands specified by the deputy, as of the end of January 2021.</p><p>The NTPF has advised my Department that they are currently reviewing the published waiting list reports in the context of the separation of adult and child waiting lists.  As part of these considerations, they will have regard to the request for greater detail in the published reports for longer waiting time bands. Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) will also be taken into account in these considerations in order to preserve patient confidentiality.</p><p>Total Paitents Waiting for a First Outpatient Appointment over 18 Months by Wait Time Band as at 28/01/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>18-21 Months</th>       <th>21-24 Months</th>       <th>24-27 Months</th>       <th>27-30 Months</th>       <th>30-33 Months</th>       <th>33-36 Months</th>       <th>36-40 Months</th>       <th>40 Months +</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>28/01/2021</td>       <td>39428</td>       <td>31014</td>       <td>19755</td>       <td>16305</td>       <td>15498</td>       <td>11931</td>       <td>10938</td>       <td>26114</td>       <td>170983</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This Government is committed to improving waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021.</p>  <p>  It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels.

This Government&rsquo;s priority is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment across all specialties, including Scoliosis. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of the deferral of elective scheduled care activity in March, April and May of 2020, and since 2nd January 2021. </p>  <p>  It is of note that key social distancing measures and Infection Prevention and Control requirements, such as two-metre distancing, have a material impact on the available physical space to deliver all hospital services, including scoliosis procedures, and this has had a significant impact on both available capacity and operational activity levels. </p>  <p>  Despite the challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic last year, by 31st December 2020 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) had carried out 322 scoliosis procedures, a decrease in activity of 16% compared with 2019. </p>  <p>  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that under the current HSE guidelines, they have reduced the number of procedures to urgent and those that are time sensitive. Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland has advised that they are working with the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh to expand orthopaedic capacity. This is expected to have a positive impact on long waiting orthopaedic patients, including reductions in waiting times for children with scoliosis. CHI is also running additional orthopaedic clinics in City West, using a new active clinical triage model, which is reducing the number of children waiting the longest for appointments. </p>  <p>  Representatives of CHI, the Orthopaedic Spinal Team and the Advocacy Groups continue to meet as part of the Co-Design framework on a quarterly basis to work on providing solutions for patients in the spinal service. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised regarding Scoliosis surgery, as this is a service issue, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the Scheme. The HSE will assist medical card holders in accessing such treatment if required. </p>  <p>  I met with representatives of the dental profession towards the end of last year when I had an opportunity to hear first-hand the challenges which they face under Covid, and the enormous efforts of their members in continuing to provide services in the current environment. I accept that the profession has concerns about the current contract, which dates back to the nineties, and that one of those concerns relates to the fee structure under the DTSS.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure the sustainability and viability of that contract and that all eligible persons can continue to receive the services that they deserve from their local dentists.  In that respect, I have asked my officials and the HSE to bring forward proposals to address the immediate concerns of the dental community.  In the longer term, my commitment to the profession and to the public is for a fundamental review of the contract, in keeping with Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. </p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Supporting positive mental health is particularly important during the current pandemic. </p><p>The Government remains fully committed to the continued development of mental health services, from mental health promotion to acute and specialist services. The approach taken reflects the principles of <i>Sl&aacute;intecare.</i></p><p>I am progressing the various mental health commitments set out in our national mental health policy, <i>Sharing the Vision,</i>and those in the current Programme for Government. In addition, I have recently extended <i>Connecting for Life</i>, the national suicide reduction strategy, until 2024. </p><p>The Government has invested significantly in enhancing mental health services. The Budget 2021 allocation of &euro;1.076 billion for mental health is an increase of &euro;50 million over 2020. Of the additional &euro;50 million for 2021, &euro;23 million will be used to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations in <i>Sharing the Vision</i>. This will fund an additional 153 staff in enhancing community mental health teams, including CAMHS, clinical care programmes, bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution. </p><p>The existing base budget each year plus any additional allocation will allow us to develop a more modern mental health service, which is recovery-focused and community based. One of the priority actions for 2021, as set out in the HSE National Service Plan, is to develop a sustainable costed plan for the governance, model of services and implementation of the national policy for mental health, <i>Sharing the Vision,</i>which has a ten-year implementation plan, overseen by the National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC). The funding required will be based on the NIMC&rsquo;s work plan, which will identify developments for each year. This funding will then be sought as part of the estimates process and in conjunction with the development of the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan each year. </p><p><i>Sharing the Vision</i>is not prescriptive on staff numbers, however the composition and skill mix of each community mental health team (CMHT), along with clinical and operational protocols, should take into consideration the needs and social circumstances of its sector population and the availability of staff with relevant skills. Providing the core skills of CMHTs are met, there should be flexibility in how the teams are resourced to meet the full range of needs where there is strong population-based needs assessment data.  <i></i></p></reply>

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases).  </p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. </p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed.</p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. </p></reply>

The <i>Mulvey Agreement</i>provides for the establishment of a new company - <i>National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC</i>- which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p><p>My Department and the HSE have had very significant engagement with NMH and SVHG to agree a legal framework, the overall objective of which is to ensure that the new hospital will remain in State ownership, and that health services at the hospital will be provided without religious, ethnic or other distinction or ethos.  While the development of the legal framework has proved to be more protracted than originally anticipated, I am hopeful that discussions will be concluded, and the drafting of the legal documents finalised, in the coming weeks.  Once finalised, I will bring the legal framework to Government for approval.</p><p>The Deputy can be assured that the Religious Sisters of Charity will not play any role in the governance or operation of the new NMH.  In that regard, in May 2017, the Sisters announced their decision to end their involvement and relinquish their shareholding in SVHG.  Since then, the Sisters have resigned from the SVHG Board and have secured the approval of the Vatican to the proposed transfer of their shareholding to a new company, <i>St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG</i>.  It is understood that SVHG has completed all regulatory and legal documentation to facilitate the share transfer. However, under the terms of their Service Level Agreement, SVHG requires the consent of the HSE to the share transfer.  I understand that the HSE and SVHG are currently engaging in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary. It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments). Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years. As such, no decisions have been made on the eligibility criteria which will need to be satisfied to a enable a person to access advanced AHR treatments through the public system. </p>  <p>  An important consideration in developing the model of care and in determining the parameters that would frame it, was its interplay with the broader AHR regulatory framework and the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p>  <p>   It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p>  <p>   In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p></reply>

It requires the involvement of two medical practitioners, one of whom must be an obstetrician and the other a medical practitioner of a relevant specialty. Both must examine the pregnant woman and both must certify their reasonable opinion, formed in good faith that the termination of pregnancy can be carried out. The termination of pregnancy must then be carried out by the certifying obstetrician, or in cases where the second certifying doctor is also an obstetrician, either one may carry out the procedure. </p><p>The provisions in the 2018 Act reflect the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, published in December 2017.</p><p>The operation of the legislation is a matter for attending clinicians. The appropriate medical body, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Obstetricians based in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, has published Clinical Guidance on Termination of Pregnancy in a number of scenarios, including the <i>Pathway for Management of Fatal Fetal Abnormalities and/or Life-Limiting Conditions Diagnosed During Pregnancy</i>.</p><p>I should note that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 makes provision for review in cases where a medical practitioner has given an opinion that would not lead to certification for termination of pregnancy to be carried out.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the pregnant woman, or a person acting on her behalf, may make an application to the HSE for a review of the relevant decision. Within three days of receiving such an application, the HSE must convene a committee of medical practitioners to review the relevant decision.  The committee must complete its review not later than seven days from the date on which it was established.</p><p>Services for termination of pregnancy under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 have continued to function during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

The HSE has: </p><p>- Increased the number of approved postgraduate training places by 106 places for July 2021;</p><p>- Introduced up to 40 new COVID Era Senior Fellowship posts for July 2021;</p><p>- Increase of 91 approved consultant posts since August 2020.Further increases are planned as part of the HSE National Service Plan.</p><p>These additional consultants and other senior decision makers will support the delivery of shorter waiting times, the reduction of hospital admissions, improved patient flow, and earlier discharge of patients to the community.</p><p>The HSE intend to review the number of intern posts in a planned and targeted manner for July 2022 to ensure any increases in intern posts aligns with projected workforce planning and postgraduate training positions. The outcome of this review with the recommended number of intern places for July 2022 will be presented to the Department of Health, later this year.</p><p>The Department of Health supports this review and welcomes it as timely in line with health reforms due to COVID-19 and planned Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.</p></reply>

In 2020, officers from the Carcase Classification Division of my Department conducted 420 inspections across 32 factories. Over 37,000 carcasses were inspected.</p>  <p>  The average number of inspections in 2020 per factory was 13 and the average number of carcasses inspected at each inspection was 89. The legal requirement is eight inspections per year and a minimum of 40 carcasses at each inspection. These inspection figures significantly exceed the numbers required under the relevant EU legislation.</p>  <p>  These unannounced checks by classification officers verify the ongoing accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times. When any mechanical system is found to be working outside of these tolerances, the meat plants concerned are instructed to revert to manual grading. Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied. </p>  <p>  The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by DAFM occurred on four occasions in 2020 and the factories in questions were instructed to revert to manual grading. In all instances, classification officers from my Department conducted a classification check before a factory was allowed to recommence mechanical grading.</p>  <p>  During these 420 inspections, classification officers also monitored compliance with the EU reference carcase presentation specification. Monitoring of carcase presentation continues to be carried out by my Department's Veterinary Public Health staff based in the factories, on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  In 2020, one factory has been fined for non-compliance with carcase presentation, details of which are published on the Department Website. Any payments made to a Farmer Supplier, including in relation to issues such as this, are a matter between the Farmer/Supplier and the Processor/plant.</p></reply>

My officials met with representatives of Horse Sport Ireland (HSI) and the Irish Equine Centre (IEC) to develop an appropriate risk mitigating response. HSI, in consultation with my Department and the IEC have published a protocol for sport horses arriving in Ireland from high risk areas of Europe outlining the measures that horse owners should take to mitigate the risk of spread. I strongly endorse the recommendations in this EHV-1 protocol that requires all those competing horses, on returning to Ireland, to isolate and carry out two PCR tests prior to completing quarantine. This is critical to the protection of our sector.</p>  <p>  Whilst Equine Herpesvirus-1 is not a notifiable disease, given the extent that the virus seems to have spread across Europe and the description of the clinical outcome, I would urge all players in the equine industry to respond to the increased risk that this poses to the equine population in Ireland and to double down on their biosecurity practices and measures.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to liaise closely with industry stakeholders, the Irish Equine Centre and colleagues in Northern Ireland on this matter.</p></reply>

Non-tariff barriers are resulting in increased costs for businesses, as well as delays and other impacts on supply chains. Traders are generally coming to terms with the reality of the changes that have come about since 1st January 2021, although the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland ensures that many of the changes arising from Brexit will not arise on the island of Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department is implementing checks and controls on agri-food goods arriving at Border Control Posts, in accordance with EU legislation. It continues to actively engage with a wide range of businesses and operators, including retailers, on both a bilateral basis and through the various consultative fora such as the Retail Roundtable chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's Retail Forum. These engagements are aimed at fostering a full understanding of the requirements to be met by operators responsible for consignments, and at resolving any issues in relation to, for example, the submission of documents. To date, we have not been made aware of any significant supply issues or specific difficulties in relation to particular products being delayed or no longer available to the Irish market.</p>  <p>  I remain strongly engaged on this issue, but the reality is that this is a very complex area, and fundamental changes have arisen as a result of the UK decision to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union. This will ultimately affect overall trade flows between Ireland and Great Britain in ways that have yet to be fully determined.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2019 reset the target for afforestation at 8,000 ha per annum and the target of forest road works at 125km per annum. In addition, a goal of 30% broadleaf planting is included in the Forestry Programme 2014 - 2020. While there are no specific targets for felling, the Coford Roundwood Forecast predicts a felling requirement of 4.1 million cubic metres in 2021<b>.</b></p><p>The table attached outlines approvals for the period 2015 -2020, measures as number of licences for each category issued in each of the years.</p><p>In terms of afforestation, my Department continues to receive and issue forestry licences daily. The area covered by issued afforestation licences so far this year is 910ha. There are currently applications within my Department&rsquo;s system covering 9,600ha which are at various stages of processing, from the initial application steps to ready for decision. In addition to this, there is another 4,500ha already approved and available to plant immediately.  It is up to landowners to decide to plant, once they have received approval to do so, but I would encourage anyone that has approval to arrange financial approval which is a straightforward process completed by their registered forester and to commence planting.</p><p>Felling licences were necessarily prioritised in the latter months of 2020 to ensure a steady supply of timber into sawmills. I am mindful of the seasonality associated with afforestation and therefore have prioritised those for the coming weeks and while other forestry licence types will continue to issue, afforestation will be the priority.</p><p>As regards felling, some three million m3 has issued since last August. Coillte now has 100% of its 2021 licensing requirement issued albeit not of all it immediately available. My Department continues to work with Coillte to resolve any issues to making their licenced material available.</p><p>In terms of road construction my Department has licensed double the forest roads at 50km in the first two months of this year compared to the same period last year. The annual target is 125km as set out in the Climate Action Plan so this target is well on track to be met.</p><p>In relation to broadleaf planting overall, in 2020 the 30% target was exceeded at 34% which means that approximately a third of all trees planted were broadleaves.</p><p>As regards Native Woodlands, the level of planting has been steadily increasing, and was the highest on record in 2020, equalling the annual target of 450ha set at the beginning of the Forestry Programme.</p><p>Other schemes such as the Neighbourwood Scheme, the Woodland Improvement Scheme and the Reconstitution and Underplanting (Ash Dieback) schemes are very much demand led. While we actively encourage participation in these schemes by those to whom they might apply, they are voluntary schemes.</p><p>We have set ourselves a target of issuing 4,500 licences in 2021 and a new structure under Project Woodland, is being introduced to ensure that the current backlog is addressed and that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland. This Project will involve a review and refresh of our processes and procedures and will include outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It will be a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones. We have set ourselves a very ambitious target of 4,500 new licences this year which represents a 74% increase on 2020.</p></reply>

The requirement to submit certain information, in advance of the arrival of the consignment, as well as for the border official to certify that the consignment complies with the requirements, is handled through European Commission&rsquo;s online platform called the Trade Expert and Control System (TRACES for short). Also in advance of arrival, importers can upload copies of documentation required for import controls (health certificates, customs declarations, commercial invoices etc) to an IT system specially built by DAFM (Import Notification Inspection System (INIS) Portal) to handle the very significant increase in demand for import controls following the departure of the UK from the European Union. Uploading of all documentation required in advance, facilitates checks in advance and the detection of problems before the consignments are presented at the border control post.</p>  <p>  Whilst all documentation can be handled electronically, there is still a legal requirement at EU level for original paper health certificates to be submitted. Work is under way at EU level to replace the requirement for paper health certificates with electronic health certificates.

However, this was rejected by all relevant Member States.</p>  <p>  I raised the matter once more at a meeting held on 2nd March with the Ambassadors to Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, where I expressed my keenness to see the solidarity so evident before the conclusion of the TCA continue to find ways to reduce this imbalance. I also reminded the Ambassadors that Ireland contributes the largest fishing grounds to the CFP.</p></reply>

We were seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both quota share and access to UK waters. This was reflected in the EU negotiation mandate and the draft EU legal text. This Government, and the previous Government, fully supported the EU negotiating mandate.</p>  <p>  The briefing material provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Defence in relation to fisheries in the context of the Minister for Foreign Affairs meeting with the French Minister for European and Foreign Affairs in Paris on 3 December 2020 provided detailed background and analysis and made clear that any outcome in the future relationship negotiations that resulted in a loss of quota share for the EU would be severely damaging to both the Irish and French fishing industries.</p>  <p>  It set down the concerns about restriction or denial of access to EU waters and the likely associated displacement of EU fishing activity into Ireland&rsquo;s zone. It emphasised that Ireland&rsquo;s position was to require the status quo be maintained for both quotas and access to all fishing grounds enjoyed by the UK and EU vessels.</p>  <p>  As you are fully aware, fisheries was one of the most difficult areas of the negotiations. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement sets out new arrangements for the joint management of more than 100 shared fish stocks in EU and UK waters. Under the Agreement, EU fishing vessels will continue to have the current level of access to UK waters at least until 2026, with quota transfers from the EU to the UK across the different stocks over that time.</p>  <p>  Fisheries was an extremely important priority for Ireland and the EU as a whole in the negotiations with the UK. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement will unfortunately have an impact on the Irish fishing industry. However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands, or had we been in a no deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters, and the subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone.</p></reply>

It usually manifests as a respiratory or reproductive disease and occasionally in a paralytic form. The primary risk mitigating measures are biosecurity and vaccination.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor the on-going outbreak of Equine Herpesvirus-1 in horses in continental Europe. My Chief Veterinary Officer and relevant officials met with representatives of Horse Sport Ireland (HSI) and the Irish Equine Centre (IEC) to develop an appropriate risk mitigating response. HSI, in consultation with my Department and the IEC have published a protocol for sport horses arriving in Ireland from high risk areas of Europe outlining the measures that horse owners should take to mitigate the risk of spread. I strongly endorse the recommendations in this protocol that requires all those competing horses, on returning to Ireland, to isolate and carry out two tests prior to completing quarantine.  This is critical to the protection of our sector.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that all horses coming into the country must be accompanied by a health certificate declaring that they clear of clinical signs of infectious disease.</p>  <p>  Given the extent that the virus seems to have spread across Europe and the description of the clinical outcome, I would urge all players in the equine industry to respond to the increased risk that this poses to the equine population in Ireland and to double down on their biosecurity practices and measures.</p></reply>

This has continued in 2020 with further increases in herd incidence and reactor numbers observed. Herd incidence (on a 12-month rolling basis) has breached 4% for the first time since 2012 and reactor numbers have exceeded 22,000 &ndash; the highest number since 2009.  These trends highlight the need for urgent action by all stakeholders to manage the risk more effectively across all transmission routes.  </p><p>Whilst the immediate trends are disappointing, good progress has been made over the past decade. During 2009, 5,860 herds were subject to restriction whilst the number in 2020 was 4,624.</p><p>The reasons for the recent increase are multifactorial and often relate to a combination of national and local factors. The expansion of the dairy herd since 2015 has played a role in this, since dairy herds, larger herds, farm fragmentation and herds which introduce more cattle are all more at risk of TB breakdowns. Wildlife is also a factor.</p><p>As a result, a range of actions are required to address the problem. Within each county, the TB programme focuses on wildlife, how disease is distributed in the area, contiguous programmes, gamma interferon testing, cleansing and disinfection, testing compliance and frequency and isolation of reactors. Each TB outbreak is investigated by a veterinary inspector to identify the source of infection.  In the case of outbreaks involving two or more standard reactors, there is a veterinary visit to advise the herdowner on how to eliminate infection and necessary measures to assist in reducing the risk of recurrence.</p><p>I recently launched a new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030. The implementation of this strategy will be overseen by the established TB Forum along with support from three working groups on science, implementation and finance, which will ensure that all aspects of the Strategy are addressed. As we are dealing with an infectious disease, the strategy is not set in stone - it is a living document which will be subject to amendment and refinement on an on-going basis. This new TB Strategy is available on <i><font color="#0000FF">www.bovinetb.ie</font></i>.</p><p>At the most recent TB Forum meeting on Thursday 4<sup>th</sup>February 2021, it was agreed by all stakeholders that extensive consultation within three working groups will develop a shared understanding of how collectively we can reduce TB incidence along with implementing the new TB Eradication Strategy.  My Department remains committed to reducing and ultimately eradicating TB in Ireland as demonstrated by the recent sanctioning of an additional 16 field officers to assist the TB Programme. </p><p>Attaining TB-free status remains critical from a farm family profitability and sustainability perspective and from a trade perspective at national and at international level. I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant emotional and financial challenge to the farm family concerned. </p><p>I will work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction. </p></reply>

While the Programme for Government commitment provides that the new NFO (or equivalent office) will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, it is important to be aware that this authority will not have a role in determining price.  </p><p>The Beef Taskforce work on price transparency, and the completion of the three market transparency studies commissioned by my Department, will be an important step towards improving visibility of the complex supply chain which is integral in fostering trust and enhancing supply chain relationships. These studies will act as an important starting point for driving increased transparency.  It is more important than ever that we all work together given the unique set of challenges currently faced by the sector. Continued strong and constructive engagement in the Beef Taskforce is key to meeting these challenges. </p></reply>

It is for this reason my Department will be focusing on afforestation applications in the coming weeks.  I am mindful of the seasonality associated with afforestation and  while other forestry licence types will continue to issue, afforestation will be the priority. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to receive and issue forestry licences daily.  To 5th March, the area covered by issued afforestation licences so far this year was 903ha.  There are currently applications within my Department&rsquo;s system, covering 9,600ha, which are at various stages of processing, from the initial application steps, to ready for decision.  In addition, there is another 4,500ha already approved and available to plant immediately.  It is up to landowners to decide to plant, once they have received approval to do so, and I would encourage anyone that has approval to arrange financial approval, which is a straightforward process completed by their registered forester, and to commence planting.</p>  <p>  Decisions that issued for afforestation licences in the last 12 months (March 2020 to February, 2021) were in the system for an average time of nine months. Some licences have issued in much shorter timeframe where they are easier to assess from an environmental point of view and every week there are applicants who receive licences on which applications were made only in the previous two months. However I accept that there are also those that are too long in the system and we are not meeting our output targets. </p>  <p>  The MacKinnon report which is now being implemented through our recently announced Project Woodland has made some key recommendations on this. One of the main targets will be to bring down the average timeframe from nine months. One of the working groups implementing Project Woodland will be tasked with setting new milestones and targets for output. </p>  <p>  We have now set ourselves a target of issuing 4,500 forestry licences in 2021, which includes afforestation, roads and felling. A new structure, under Project Woodland, is being introduced  to ensure that the current backlog is addressed and that a new impetus is brought to  woodland creation in Ireland. This Project will involve a review and refresh of our processes and  procedures and will include outside stakeholder participation to bring an independent perspective. It will be a task-driven process, with clear deliverable and milestones, and I anticipate that we will reach our 4,500 target this year.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting afforestation and to encourage farmers to look at tree planting as a complementary income stream to a productive farming enterprise.</p></reply>

The Department of Rural and Community Development community grants and funding programmes include:</p><p>- The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. The current programme began on 1 January 2018 and will run until the end of 2022. SICAP aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality. It does this through Programme Implementers, agencies and companies, who work with the most disadvantaged and the hardest to reach in communities. It is a national programme delivered with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. SICAP is overseen by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each local authority area. Each LCDC agrees annual targets for its area based on local needs. My Department has engaged Pobal to work on its behalf to manage and oversee the reporting of SICAP nationally. SICAP supports a range of groups in society which are disadvantaged and marginalized.</p><p>- The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports 420 community organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model. CSP funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of employing staff in these organisations. It meets local service gaps and provides services and facilities that would not be available otherwise. Some &euro;49million is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2021.</p><p>- The &euro;4.5 million Community Enhancement Programme aims to streamline funding to communities in need. The programme is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.  Its mission is to provide funding to improve facilities available to communities. The funding is allocated to each Local Authority area by a methodology that reflects deprivation levels in each area. This uses the Pobal-Hasse deprivation index.</p><p>- &euro;6.5 million is provided by my Department towards the regeneration of Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City (NEIC) to support the implementation of the Mulvey Report &ldquo;Creating a Brighter Future&rdquo; and the NEIC Strategic Plan 2020-2022.</p><p>- Community and Voluntary Pillar funding (&euro;565,000): My Department also provides annual funding to members of the Community and Voluntary Pillar to support costs, not funded from any other sources, directly related to the organisations &rsquo;contribution to policy-making.</p><p>- My Department&rsquo;s Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, community and voluntary organisations that demonstrate good governance and deliver services and supports that have a focus on one or more of the following: addressing poverty, social exclusion and promoting equality. The current scheme commenced on 1 July 2019 and will cease on 30 June 2022. The application process for the current scheme is now closed. </p><p>- My Department has responsibility for administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund, including approving the measures to be funded from the Fund which are delivered across a range of Government departments.</p><p>- The Seniors Alert Scheme encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities, through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. Funding is available under the scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of a personal alarm or pendant and is administered on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by Pobal. </p><p>- Up to &euro;75,700 is provided annually by my Department in respect of each Public Participation Network (PPN).</p><p>- My Department provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their library services. Funding is provided, for example, as a contribution towards the cost of developing library buildings, technological capacity and resources, book-stock and other areas of activity that enhance local library services. Responsibility for the delivery of public library services is generally a matter for each local authority in its capacity as a library authority under the Local Government Act 2001.</p><p>- My Department makes an annual payment to Local Authorities towards the  cost of additional staff to support the community function in local authorities. It is expected that these posts will continue to support the  Local Community Development Committee arrangements and the implementation of Local Economic and Community Plans in particular.</p><p>An additional &euro;10million has been allocated to the Stability Fund as part of the revised Resilience and Recovery plan announced in February by the Taoiseach. Further details on how relevant organisations can apply for this funding will be available shortly. The Government is aware of the challenges facing community and voluntary organisations and is committed to working closely with the sector in managing through these, recognising that it will require a whole of Government approach.</p><p>- The &euro;5.5m CL&Aacute;R programme provides funding for small-scale infrastructural projects in rural areas. While not delivered by the Community Division, CL&Aacute;R aims  to support sustainable development of designated areas which have experienced significant levels of depopulation. The funding works in conjunction with local funding and on the basis of locally identified priorities. The scheme is delivered mainly by local authorities in consultation with groups in local communities, with applications for some measures submitted directly to the Department. </p><p>- Further details relating to eligibility criteria and to making applications for funding are available on <i>gov.ie</i>.</p></reply>

It is delivered at local level though Local Action Groups (LAGs), using the LEADER methodology.  Projects are jointly approved by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>Since its launch almost three years ago, a total of 109 projects with a combined grant value of over &euro;6.72 million have been approved for funding under the LEADER Food Initiative. In addition, up to &euro;1.68 million is available for the administration costs of the LAGs. </p><p>A further 13 applications, with a grant value of over &euro;0.8 million are at earlier stages of the approvals process. </p><p>Project payments are drawn down as approved works are completed and claims for payment are submitted by the project promoters. To date, my Department has approved payment claims and associated administration costs totaling &euro;2.36 million in respect of these projects. Final claims for payment under the initiative must be submitted to my Department no later than 30 June 2024.</p><p>Applications for financial support under the Food Initiative are still being accepted by the LAGs. </p><p>In December 2020, I announced details of a Transitional LEADER Programme which will come into effect from 1 April 2021 and run to the end of 2022.  As part of this announcement, I also approved an increase in the rate of aid for private enterprises and commercial community projects, from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75%.  LEADER Food Initiative projects approved on or after the 1<sup>st</sup>April 2021, which satisfy the conditions, can also be considered for the increased rate of aid by the LAG.</p><p>With almost &euro;10 million of the total LEADER Food Initiative allocation having now been committed, I am confident that the remaining funding will be allocated between now and the end of the Transitional Programme period.</p></reply>

Along with other broader Government initiatives, my Department has introduced a suite of programmes to support community and voluntary organisations weather the impact of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  In 2020, a &euro;50 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and administered by my Department. This funding was made available from the Dormant Accounts Fund and consisted of the COVID-19 Stability Fund and the Innovate Together Fund.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;10M has been allocated to the Stability Fund as part of the COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 plan announced by the Taoiseach on Tuesday 23rd February. Further details on how relevant organisations can apply for this funding will be available shortly.</p>  <p>  In December, my Department launched a &euro;1.7m COVID-19 Emergency Fund, which community and voluntary groups could apply for through their local authorities. This follows on from a previous &euro;2.5m round of this fund which was focussed on groups participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative. Successful organisations will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) provides funding for capital grants towards enhancing facilities available to communities. The funding is allocated to local authorities and administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs). Further details on the 2021 scheme will be announced in Q2 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department currently supports 420 community organisations under the Community Services Programme (CSP) to provide local services through a social enterprise model.  In response to the difficulties faced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a &euro;4.75M Support Fund which assists all CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll and also provides assistance for the Employers PRSI contribution during this crisis period and until April 2021.  My Department and Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department, are continuing to monitor the situation closely in light of the current COVID-19 restrictions and the ongoing costs being incurred by organisations</p>  <p>  In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>I would encourage organisations to continue to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company so that they are aware of funding opportunities as they become available  .</p></reply>
