    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600035#WRA00600"><p>Institutional investors represent one aspect of the property market and have an important role in increasing supply.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Government monitors the actions of investors in the market and has taken action when abuses have been identified. In 2016, changes were introduced to address concerns regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by foreign investors to take profits derived from Irish real estate without paying Irish tax.</p>  <p>  This resulted in the introduction of the IREF (Irish Real Estate Fund) framework in 2016.  IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where at least 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Certain investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax acts.</p>  <p>  The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) framework was introduced in 2013, to facilitate long-term, risk-diversified, collective investment in rental property. In order to be a REIT, a company must be listed on the main market of an EU stock exchange within three years of forming, and it must be widely held. Income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed.</p>  <p>  Dividend withholding tax at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pension funds and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  Given the important implications which developments in the property market can have for the economy, my Department actively monitors developments in this sector on an ongoing basis. As part of the 2018 Finance Act process I committed to produce a report on REITs, IREFs and section 110 companies as they invest in the Irish property market. This report was prepared by officials in my Department and was presented to the Tax Strategy Group in July. This paper provides a basis for policy discussions in relation to institutional investment in the Irish property market.</p></reply>

Production companies are now required to apply to the DCHG before commencement of Irish production to have the film certified as a qualifying film. </p>  <p>  As part of the application process, applicants must provide a skills development plan and, if the amount of eligible expenditure is over &euro;2m, that plan must be agreed with Screen Ireland. Additionally, a post project skills development report is required for each project.</p>  <p>  In terms of quality employment, the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through the Workplace Relations Commission.  However, as part of the new certification process to be undertaken by DCHG, an applicant company is required to sign an undertaking of compliance with all relevant employment legislation. This undertaking is required to be signed and furnished with every section 481 application.</p>  <p>  These conditions shall be met not just by a producer company but also by the qualifying company. If a producer does not comply with the employment and skills development requirements set out by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht they may not be eligible for the corporation tax credit.  Any amount already claimed may be recoverable, with interest. </p>  <p>  I have further been advised by my officials that, following a joint request by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Services, Industry, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU), and Screen Producers Ireland, the WRC has agreed to undertake an audit of the Republic of Ireland Independent Film and Television Drama Production Sector with a view to examining industrial relations generally, employment practices and procedure, assessing issues arising (if any), and making recommendations for their improvement where appropriate.</p>  <p>  The WRC has published a Workplace Relations Notice on its website, inviting submissions from stakeholders on the above listed matters by 31 October 2019. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600035#WRA01300"><p>As the Deputy is aware, credit unions are regulated and supervised by the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank who is the independent regulator for credit unions. Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. </p>  <p>  Since 2004 the amount of the Industry Funding Levy payable by each credit union has been capped at a rate of 0.01% of total assets. </p>  <p>  Consultation Paper 95 "Joint Public Consultation Paper - Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland - Funding the Cost of Financial Regulation" (CP95) was published in 2015 and set out proposals to move from partial industry funding of financial regulation towards full industry funding, noting the proposal set out in an earlier consultation conducted by the Central Bank (CP61 "Consultation on Impact Based Levies and Other Levy Related Matters") to move credit unions to fund 50% of the cost of regulating the credit union sector.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated, in its Funding Strategy and 2018 Guide to the Industry Funding Levy, that it intended to seek my approval to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from credit unions on a phased basis setting out an initial target of 50% to be reached by 2021.</p>  <p>  In response to the Central Bank's request I recommended that credit union contributions should not increase beyond the 50% target until: </p>  <p>1. The levy trajectory has reached the planned 50% rate, at which time the impact on the viability of the sector will be better understood; and</p>  <p> 2. A public consultation regarding increasing the levy rate for credit unions beyond 50% is undertaken, which would include a regulatory impact assessment of such a change on the sector.</p>  <p>  In contrast to this, recovery rates in 2018 for all other industry categories ranged from 65% to 100%, and the Central Bank intends to increase all to 100% funding over the next number of years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might also wish to note that the Department of Finance, in collaboration with the Central Bank, held a public consultation on potential changes to the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund Levy, which is expected to reduce materially from 2020. The outcome, following the public consultation, will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as Minister for Finance I have reduced the Stabilisation Scheme Levy materially and that since 2017 no further levies have been charged by the Credit Union Restructuring Board (ReBo). I have previously committed to a further review of the Stabilisation Scheme in 2020.</p>  <p>  On 28th August last, I also held a meeting with the credit union representative bodies to discuss their views on the Industry Funding Levy and other credit union related matters.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600035#WRA01700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions. Having said that, the Deputy will be aware that the Climate Action Plan 2019 provided a commitment to assess a Carbon Tax trajectory of at least &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, having regard to considerations on the social and economic impacts.  </p>  <p>  A carbon tax was introduced in Ireland on a phased basis beginning in 2009.  Initially it applied to transport fuels, and was extended to other non-solid fuels (such as kerosene, green diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas) in May 2010.  When introduced, the rate was &euro;15 per tonne of CO2 emissions and this was increased to &euro;20 per tonne in December 2011.  Carbon tax was extended to solid fuels at a reduced rate of &euro;10 per tonne from May 2013 which increased to &euro;20 per tonne in May 2014.  In 2018, the VAT exclusive yield from carbon tax was approximately &euro;431 million. </p>  <p>  While hypothecation is not a feature of the Irish taxation system in general as it can constrain the flexibility of the Government in expenditure decisions, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action recommended that hypothecation of carbon tax revenues be considered. To this end my Department conducted a public consultation on the options for use of revenues raised from increases in the carbon tax. Among the options presented were a &ldquo;tax and dividend scheme&rdquo;. There were 66 respondents to the consultation, representing businesses, private individuals as well as social, voluntary and community and &ldquo;other&rdquo; sectors.    </p>  <p>  The most favoured options were ring-fencing additional carbon tax revenues for the purposes of enhancing the current Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant scheme for household energy efficiency improvements and to fund sustainable transport infrastructure.  The option of returning the proceeds by way of dividend to citizens or households through the social welfare and/or tax system received a negative response overall, being one of the least supported and most opposed options.</p>  <p>  In the context of Budget 2020 and future tax policy, I will consider all options relating to the carbon tax.  </p></reply>

For example, such individuals may be transferred to head up new divisions of the company or take charge of new product development.</p><p>In accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines, SARP is currently the subject of an independent review which is being carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. The review exercise affords an opportunity to look at all elements of the relief and it also includes consultation with stakeholders. </p><p>The terms of reference of the review include:</p><p>-  the continuing relevance of the programme;</p><p>-  the performance of the programme in terms of meeting its objectives;</p><p>-  the particular features of the programme;</p><p>-  the annual cost and </p><p>-  the overall impact of the programme.</p><p>The appropriateness of the present upper and the lower limit on the quantum of income that should benefit from the tax relief is also to be examined having regard to the objectives of the scheme and to the principles of tax equity. </p><p>I understand that the report is currently being finalised and I expect that it will be submitted to my Department in the next few days.  It is my intention to publish the report in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600035#WRA02300"><p>When the UK leaves the EU, it will become a third country from a customs perspective and the free circulation and free movement of goods between the EU and the UK will end. This will increase substantially the number of businesses that will have to complete customs formalities and other related obligations for trade with the UK and through the UK landbridge to the EU. This will present a significant challenge for many of those businesses which have not had any experience of third country trade and customs formalities.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that in the last few months as part of its ongoing multi-layered trader engagement programme, Revenue wrote to all businesses who traded with the UK in 2018 or in the first six months of 2019, outlining the practical preparatory steps to take based on their trade pattern with the U.K. In addition, businesses with significant or frequent trade with the UK received or will soon receive a follow up phone call from Revenue. I understand that follow up calls will be completed by Revenue by the end of September. </p>  <p>  In regard to VAT, under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, VAT on import will be chargeable at the point of importation unless the importer is approved to use the current deferred payment system, which allows approved traders to defer payment of certain charges, including customs and VAT at import, until the 15th of the month following importation. The Deputy will be aware that I made provision in the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT registered traders importing goods from non-EU countries, which will be implemented if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement.</p>  <p>  Revenue continue to assist businesses planning to register for VAT in Ireland for the first time as a result of Brexit, and for businesses that may choose to make their Mini One Stop Shop digital sales VAT returns through Ireland following a UK departure from the EU.</p></reply>

As outlined by the Ombudsman in his reply, before a formal investigation of a complaint can commence, this FSPO must assess whether the complaint has been made within the time limits set out in Section 51 the 2017 Act.</p>  <p>  Section 51 of the 2017 Act provides that the complaint must be made, within whichever of the following periods is last to expire; </p>  <p>  (i) 6 years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint; </p>  <p>  (ii) 3 years from the earlier of the date on which the Complainant became aware or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct giving rise to the complaint; </p>  <p>  (iii) Such longer periods as the Ombudsman may allow where it appears to him that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just an equitable, in all of the circumstances to extend the period. </p>  <p>  In order for the Ombudsman to exercise his discretion under Section 51(2)(a)(iii) there must be reasonable grounds in the particular complaint, for him to permit a longer period to enable the complaint to be made, and it must be just and equitable in all of the circumstances for him to do so.</p>  <p>  When an assessment is conducted, it is open to a provider to express a view that the complaint was made within the time-periods in s51 of the 2017 Act. Some providers have taken this approach in relation to all tracker mortgage interest rate complaints.

LPT has yielded over &euro;2.42 billion for local authorities since its introduction, with the annual LPT allocation currently standing at close to &euro;465 million, which supplements other local authority income. The Local Property Tax is currently forecast to yield approximately &euro;470 million this year.</p>  <p>  The taxation of property through a recurring annual tax is less economically distortionary than tax imposed on either income or capital. This is supported by analysis and international experience where, for example, the OECD in 2011 suggested that tax on property is considered the least harmful to growth. It is also the International and European norm. At just 0.6% of national income, the LPT yield in Ireland is low when compared to rates of 2.8% in France and over 3% in the United Kingdom.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that LPT returns require owners to indicate whether their properties are principal or non-principal primary residences (NPPR). However, the information does not distinguish whether NPPR properties are owned by commercial landlords or otherwise. Page 27 of the Revenue Ready Reckoner which is available online shows the effect of additional charges on NPPR properties. If Principal Private Residences were exempted from the tax as the Deputy seems to suggest, approximately &euro;410 million currently collected under the LPT would be lost. The number of properties indicated as NPPRs, is  approximately 260,000 and, consequently, for the Deputy&rsquo;s suggested replacement tax, a very high tax rate would have to be imposed on these properties in order to maintain the current yield.</p>  <p>  Last April, the Report of the Inter-Departmental Review Group was published and, having considered the findings of the review report, I decided to defer valuation date from 1st November 2019 to 1st November 2020. This deferral gives sufficient time to build consensus about the best way forward for the tax and to prepare appropriate legislation.  Therefore, I have no plans to abolish the Local Property Tax.</p></reply>

The zero rate for food and drink is provided for under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991. The legislative provision for food and drink was in place on 1 January 1991, however there was no legislative provision for food supplement products and therefore they cannot be legally zero rated. </p>  <p>  Shortly after the introduction of VAT Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils. </p>  <p>  Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. </p>  <p>  Following this review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Act 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the consideration of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p></reply>

This was subsequently endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers at their meeting in Fukuoka on 8-9 June 2019, and by G20 Leaders in Osaka on 28-29 June 2019.  This Programme of Work splits the continuing work among two separate Pillars.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently the OECD Secretariat has been working on a &ldquo;unified approach&rdquo; based on significant commonalities of the three proposals under Pillar One of the Programme of Work.  This proposal will be published in October and it is anticipated that there will be a public consultation during November. </p>  <p>  My position has consistently been that Pillar One proposals examining the issue of where companies generate their value and whether new concepts of value creation need to be recognised might provide a basis upon which a sustainable agreement could be found at the OECD. Nevertheless there remains many questions to be answered before we have a workable solution which achieves consensus on this proposal.</p>  <p>  Pillar Two of the Programme of Work seeks to examine whether minimum effective tax rate rules should be agreed.  As I have said previously, this Pillar remains problematic, not least because of a lack of clarity as to what it is the proposal is trying to achieve. I remain to be convinced of the validity and appropriateness of this proposal in reaching an agreed outcome to addressing the tax challenges of digitalisation.</p>  <p>  I have long acknowledged that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  The Programme of Work has targeted an agreed outcome by the end of 2020 although further time would then be required for any agreement to be implemented by countries whether domestically or multilaterally. </p>  <p>  Work on assessing all of the issues around the sustainability of corporation tax receipts and the potential fiscal vulnerabilities this may cause is ongoing. At a recent sitting of the Budget Oversight Committee I indicated that I would consider whether the expected publication date of March 2020 could be brought forward.</p></reply>

I will bring recommendations to Government in due course.  Furthermore, my Department will undertake and publish an assessment of the sustainability of corporation tax receipts, in light of future multilateral policy changes in this area. </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to debt ratio targets, my Department&rsquo;s analysis of debt as published in its Annual Report on Public Debt in Ireland includes, amongst others, the debt-to-GNI* metric, as suggested by IFAC.</p></reply>

It shows that vast majority of the recommendations due before Q2 2019 have been completed.</p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance</p>  <p>  As outlined to the Deputy in previous PQ responses (including PQs 25241/19, 17651/19, 9764/19, 7359/19, 48428/18 and 40780/18), stakeholder consultation formed the foundation upon which the two primary reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group and the accompanying recommendations were developed.  This consultation process involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Department officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland. Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p></reply>

Under the Act, fossil fuels are defined as oil, natural gas, peat, coal or any derivative thereof intended for use in the production of energy by combustion.</p>  <p>  I am informed by ISIF that by early January 2019, it had sold approximately &euro;72m worth of stocks and bonds in 38 individual fossil fuel undertakings.</p>  <p>  Following enactment, ISIF published a Fossil Fuel exclusion list on its website, encompassing 148 companies in which it will not invest. The list is actively monitored and reviewed every 6 months, and so, in July 2019, was extended by a further 33 undertakings. As part of ongoing compliance with the Act, further divestments were therefore made.</p>  <p>  The recently launched all of Government Action Plan contains a number of actions which aim to encourage private sector investment to assist in the low carbon transition. While I believe that questions relating to the Plan are more appropriately for answer by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, there are two actions which are broadly related to the Deputy&rsquo;s query which do fall under the remit of the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Under action 10, the State will be exploring options for non-Exchequer sources of financing climate action and green investments and assessing the international sustainable and green finance environment for other potential solutions. The direct focus of the action is investment, not necessarily divestment, but, nonetheless, is part of the broader green finance agenda.</p>  <p>  Action 11, meanwhile, includes the promotion of the sustainable finance sector in Ireland, through the new strategy for international financial services, &lsquo;Ireland for Finance&rsquo;. It also includes engagement at EU level on sustainable finance proposals, particularly regarding establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment by creating a unified classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activity. This will be an important step in advancing the connection between financial markets and private investors with a sustainability agenda.</p></reply>

Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union, asking it to annul the Decision of the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Attorney General prepared the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings and the application has been lodged in the General Court of the European Union.</p>  <p>  As is normal practice, a summary of the legal grounds for the appeal have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  They were also published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in December 2016. The oral hearing for the appeal took place at the General Court of the European Union on 17 and 18 September 2019 and an overview of Ireland&rsquo;s position at the oral hearing was published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The cumulative cost to date in respect of the entire appeal and recovery in the Apple case is in the order of &euro;7.2 million (including VAT). This includes all legal costs, consultancy fees and other associated costs. These fees have been paid by the Department of Finance, Revenue Commissioners, NTMA, Central Bank of Ireland, Attorney General's Office and Chief State Solicitor's Office. </p>  <p>  It will most likely be several years before the full process of litigation, which may include engagement with the European Court of Justice, is ultimately concluded. For this reason, it is not possible to have a fixed projection of costs for the entire case.</p>  <p>  This case has involved a significant degree of legal and technical complexity and additional expertise has been engaged where required. With regard to future anticipated costs, as it is and will continue to be an important issue for the State, it will continue to be appropriately resourced. </p></reply>

This approach is designed to provide for complete and open access to the data held on any such database for all market participants.  </p>  <p>  The current position in relation to the development of this database is that the Insurance Fraud Database Working Group, chaired by the Crime Division of the Department of Justice and Equality  (DJE)is continuing to meet in order to work through the various requirements of such a database including satisfactory data protection requirements. </p>  <p>  In this regard, DJE submitted a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) on the current industry database &lsquo;Insurance Link&rsquo; to the Office of the Data Protection Commission (ODPC) on behalf of Insurance Ireland in June 2019. DJE is continuing to engage with Insurance Ireland and the Office of the Data Protection Commission on this matter.</p>  <p>  It is too early at this stage to consider whether legislation is needed to underpin such a database. A decision of this nature can only be made when all data protection-related issues have been addressed. If it becomes apparent that legislation is required, my Department will consider in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Equality how to progress this matter appropriately.</p>  <p>  Subject to consultation with the ODPC, the next phase towards implementation of this recommendation will require the identification of an appropriate independent body to manage the database. The Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to closely monitor progress of the implementation of this recommendation.</p></reply>

While a no deal Brexit will never be Ireland or the EU&rsquo;s choice, the risk of a no deal remains significant and, therefore, no deal preparations have the highest priority across Government. </p>  <p>  The aim of the Government&rsquo;s preparations is to make sure that Irish citizens and businesses are as ready as possible for a no deal Brexit, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s most recent Contingency Action Plan published in July. This plan sets out in detail the Government&rsquo;s analysis of the risks and impacts of a no deal outcome across the range of key issues and sectors and the extensive work ongoing across Government to mitigate these risks. This plan follows on the enactment of the Brexit Omnibus Act earlier this year and the roll-out of a comprehensive programme of engagement with stakeholders across all key sectors with over 1,200 events to date so that citizens and business take the necessary actions to prepare. This is in parallel with detailed contingency planning at EU level. However, as underlined in the Contingency Plan, notwithstanding Government preparations, a no deal Brexit will be highly disruptive for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the State and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the Brexit disruption to trade, to the greatest extent possible.  My Departments and its agencies are advancing preparations within the whole of Government framework overseen by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Government has already taken important steps to prepare our economy, including through dedicated measures announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, supported by long-term planning through the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework which will provide significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 is being prepared on the basis of Government assessments of the implications of a possible no deal &ndash; not because we are resigned to this outcome but because it is the only prudent way to prepare. It is important to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario. For the most affected sectors, a number of temporary, targeted support measures are under consideration and both the level and type of support will be finalised as part of the Budget 2020 negotiation. Assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, whilst preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances. Finally, it is important to safeguard the hard won progress of recent years in stabilising the public finances.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the financial services sector, the Central Bank has been preparing extensively for Brexit. The Central Bank is satisfied that, from a financial stability perspective, the most material and immediate risks from a no-deal Brexit are manageable.  Some level of market disruption would be inevitable in a no-deal scenario, but the system as a whole should be resilient enough to withstand these bumps.   </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are also prioritising Brexit preparations and have been taking measures aimed at facilitating and supporting legitimate trade with UK post Brexit, in close cooperation with other Government agencies. These measures include a significant upgrade of their national Customs ICT system to deal with increased volumes of customs declarations, the assignment and training of up to 600 additional staff for Brexit related roles across a range of functions and an ongoing extensive nationwide trader outreach programme. Additional physical capacity is also in place at ports and airports to apply checks and controls. Funding and training has also been provided to support the customs intermediary sector.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department and its relevant agencies  are continuing to give the highest priority to the work of preparing for a no deal Brexit, including encouraging and supporting preparedness by business and citizens across the county  so that we can mitigate the impacts to the greatest extent possible.</p></reply>

These requirements are set out in Article 130 of the Treaty and ensure that the principle of central bank independence is respected and there is no influence on the members of ECB&rsquo;s decision-making bodies. Clearly, therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to make submissions such as the Deputy suggests.</p>  <p>  While the ECB is independent in carrying out its mandate and tasks, it is not unaccountable. As a European institution, the ECB is accountable in the first instance to the European Parliament.  The President of the ECB regularly reports on the ECB's monetary policy and its other tasks at his hearings before the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In addition, the ECB replies to written questions from MEPs, which are published with the ECB's answers in the Official Journal of the EU and on the ECB's website.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland is part of the Eurosystem, which consists of the ECB and the National Central Banks of the nineteen Member States that have adopted the euro. The Central Bank contributes to the formulation of monetary policy at Eurosystem level, and further details of this are set out in the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report.</p>  <p>  Aside from issues of monetary policy, the Deputy might also consider the role of fiscal policy at the broader European level.  The Commission is currently reviewing the fiscal rules and framework, and many of these issues were discussed at the recent Ecofin meeting. There is a general acceptance that the current framework can be improved and the recent report by the European Fiscal Board contained a number of interesting suggestions.</p></reply>

HBFI continues to benefit from a strong pipeline of interest from prospective borrowers as a result of these engagement activities.</p><p>The primary objective of HBFI is to increase the availability of funding in the market to developers for viable residential development projects. It is important that appropriate credit, due diligence and legal procedures are adhered to in all areas of the lending process - to safeguard, in so far as possible, the funding provided by HBFI. These procedures require adequate time to ensure the highest standards are met and it is important that HBFI have a consistent approach in all applications for funding. </p></reply>

The day to day operations of the banks are the sole responsibility of the boards and management teams and each bank must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  In regards to your question about repayments, both AIB and PTSB have a wide range of mortgage products with differing rates. The Deputy can find the full breakdown of the various products and their applicable interest rates on the websites for the banks in question: (https://aib.ie/our-products/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates and www.permanenttsb.ie/mortgages/mortgage-interest-rates/).</p>  <p>  You refer to both the ECB's interest rate for deposits and its marginal interest rate in the context of where mortgage rates are in Ireland. First of all I think it is important to note that neither AIB nor PTSB fund their mortgage books via the ECB. However it is true that Irish mortgage rates are higher than the European average. Indeed the reasons for this were explored in a report published by my department in March (Risk Weighted Assets in Ireland: The Link to Mortgage Interest Rates).</p>  <p>  This report shows that a large part of the difference between Irish mortgage rates and European mortgage rates is linked to how capital rules are applied. The very significant loss history from the last crisis mean that Irish banks now have to hold far more capital on mortgage loans than their European peers. This and other contributing factors are discussed in the report. The report is available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/ff6c0a-risk-weighted-assets-in-ireland-the-link-to-mortgage-interest-rates/.</p></reply>

The most recent data available show the average weekly wage grew by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019.  In the earlier stages of economic recovery, growth in weekly earnings was primarily as a result of growth in hours worked per week, but recent data have shown much stronger growth in average hourly pay.  For instance, in 2018 average weekly earnings grew by 3.3 per cent, with average hourly earnings growing by 2.9 per cent.</p>  <p>  Below the headline figure, the data show variation across sectors of the economy.  For example, recent quarters have seen strong growth in weekly earnings for workers in the &lsquo;administrative and support services&rsquo;, &lsquo;information and communication technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;transport and storage&rsquo; sectors.  Over the last 12 months, both weekly and hourly earnings are growing across all economic sectors reported by the CSO, showing the broad-based strength of Ireland&rsquo;s current economic performance.</p>  <p>  The latest macroeconomic forecasts published by my Department as part of the Stability Programme Update in April this year projected continued growth in average wages of 3 per cent for 2019, with further wage growth expected in the medium-term.  This is consistent with the other labour market elements of the forecast, such as continued growth in employment and a further decline in the unemployment rate.  This also indicates the existence of a &lsquo;Phillips curve&rsquo; in the Irish economy - with the labour market closing in on full employment and the supply of labour becoming scarce, wages are increasing in order to attract or retain employees.  A new set of labour market projections and commentary will be published with Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am fully alert to the possible risk of an overheating economy.  Indeed the Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Ireland strategy aims to maximise the supply of suitably skilled labour in our economy, boosting productivity and protecting our international competitiveness.</p></reply>

The correspondence, which is an external legal opinion sought by the Deputy, suggests changes to the current CAT rules and treatment. </p>  <p>  For the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance and the person who receives the gift or inheritance determines the lifetime tax-free threshold (the Group Threshold) below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. As Capital Acquisitions Tax is generally payable by the beneficiary, rather than the disponer, the system promotes horizontal equity in that all individuals with similar circumstances are treated in a similar manner.</p>  <p>  It is a long-held principle of inheritance tax that transfers of assets between spouses are exempt. The spousal exemption from inheritance tax was extended to civil partners from 1 January 2011. Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of tax as a separate and unconnected individual. </p>  <p>  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p>  <p>  I would say that where two people - irrespective of their relationship - share a home owned by one of them, and where the homeowner dies leaving that home to the other person, they can avail of the CAT dwelling house exemption, once other conditions of the relief are met.  </p>  <p>  As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status. There would be a significant potential Exchequer cost with the extension of the Category A threshold to allow individuals with no children to nominate a potential beneficiary.  </p>  <p>  Apart from the potential legal difficulties of any change in the treatment of cohabitants, which is a broader policy issue than just CAT, there would be potentially significant Exchequer costs in changing the current CAT rules.</p></reply>

The realisation of this surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.</p>  <p>  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full by March 2020. It is estimated that &euro;2 billion will be transferred in 2020 with a further &euro;1.5 billion being transferred in 2021 and &euro;0.5 billion in 2022. This timeline is contingent on NAMA&rsquo;s projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.</p>  <p>  In July I published the second Section 227 Review into the progress NAMA has made in achieving its objectives. Considering the advanced stage of NAMA's deleveraging activities I also took the opportunity to review the arrangements for the wind down of NAMA for the coming years. A copy of this review has been published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  On foot of the review I have recommended that NAMA be allowed additional time to work through a residual loan portfolio with a projected carrying value of c.1% of its originally acquired assets that is expected to remain at the end of 2021. A limited extension of NAMA will enable the Agency to maximise the value of this residual portfolio in the interest of the taxpayer and best fulfil the Agency&rsquo;s commercial obligations under Section 10 of the NAMA Act. NAMA shall submit a detailed wind-down plan for its ultimate dissolution to the Minister for Finance by the end of 2021, and its operations shall not continue past end-December 2025.</p>  <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s extension will not impact upon the timeline for the transfer of its expected &euro;4bn surplus.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised that this position is unchanged.  </p>  <p>  The flat rate expenses regime is a concessionary practice operated by Revenue where both specific commonality of expenditure exists across an employment category and the statutory requirement for the tax deduction as set out in section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is satisfied. To qualify for a deduction under that section, an expense must be &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily&rdquo; incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment and paid by the employee.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the flat rate expenses regime is to simplify tax administration for both taxpayers and Revenue by making it easier for large groups of employees working in the same sector to avail of their entitlement to tax relief in respect of allowable expenses incurred in the performance of their employment duties.  I understand that the purpose of the review is to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices.  Each category is being examined separately in light of the legislative requirements and Revenue has engaged with relevant representative bodies in each of the cases under review.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware from my previous replies to questions on this matter that I am aware of Revenue&rsquo;s programme of work in this area.  Furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the administration of the tax code is exclusively a matter for Revenue who are independent in the performance of their functions.  Any changes in practice to the flat rate expenses regime are therefore a matter for Revenue, but I understand that any withdrawal of the practice can only take place if Revenue are satisfied that there is no longer a legally valid basis to give the concession, after engagement with the relevant representative body acting on behalf of the various categories of workers.</p>  <p>  As I have said on previous occasions, there has been no change to the general rule set out in legislation so all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 TCA for any valid expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed from any source.  So while certain employees may no longer claim a deduction on a universal &ldquo;flat rate&rdquo; basis, they may still be able to still claim a deduction on a specific &ldquo;vouched basis&rdquo;.</p></reply>

I continued this engagement over the summer months and I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith, meeting most recently last week, to work to secure agreement between the parties to get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. </p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process with that objective over the last number of months. Progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The awful murder of Lyra McKee and the outpouring of public feeling that followed demands a serious response at political level. People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and deal with the issues and challenges that Northern Ireland faces at present, not least the difficulties raised by the UK exit from the European Union. The functioning of the North South Ministerial Council is also urgently required, to bring together the Executive and the Government to oversee and develop co-operation on the island, and as a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties, in particular the two largest parties, must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again. </p>  <p>  This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. Accordingly, the Government will continue to do everything possible to support continuing engagement and progress in discussions between the political parties, working with the UK Government in any scenario, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

The Irish banks have made huge progress in this regard since the height of the crisis. According to the Central Bank of Ireland, the average NPL ratio of the domestic Irish banks was 7.0% at end-June 2019 having stood at more than 30% at peak in 2013. In volume terms, NPLs in the domestic Irish banks have now fallen by &euro;70.2 billion (82%), from peak in 2013. A major contributor to this has been the almost 109,000 mortgage restructures that are currently in place. </p>  <p>  Despite this progress, more work is required before the NPL ratios at the Irish banks reach the European average of under 4%.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the protections in place for all borrowers before a sale remain unchanged. For example, Start Mortgages and Pepper, the firms involved in the loan sales transacted by PTSB since 2018, are both regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. When dealing with borrowers, these firms are required to comply with the Consumer Protection Code and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. Furthermore, assurances have been given that the terms of a restructure agreed before these sales took place will continue to be honoured.</p>  <p>  In addition, in 2018 I asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the CCMA to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The result of this review was published last October and it is encouraging to note that the key findings included confirmation that for borrowers who engaged with the process, the CCMA is working effectively as it is intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to highlight that I cannot stop loan sales, even by the banks in which the State has a shareholding. These decisions are the responsibility of the Board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks, which are legally binding documents that I cannot change unilaterally.</p></reply>

Indeed as a barometer of how well our economy is performing, there is no story more positive than the one emanating from our labour market. The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 63,100 (+2.8 per cent) in the first half of 2019. As a result, there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland.</p>  <p>   Since the publication of my Department&rsquo;s last set of macroeconomic projections published as part of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019, the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal has increased substantially. To reflect this, for budgetary purposes, the Government has decided to base Budget 2020 on the assumption of a 'no-deal' Brexit. As part of Budget 2020 my Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts which will be based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU without a deal.  </p>  <p>   My Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) recently published an updated model-based assessment of the economic impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the Irish economy. The research found that in aggregate terms compared to a scenario in which the UK did not leave the EU the level of GDP would be 3 per cent lower after 5 years. Despite the negative impact of no-deal Brexit, the Irish economy is still expected to grow but at a slower pace as a consequence of Brexit.   </p>  <p>  As we chart our way forward through the uncertain times ahead, careful management of the public finances is needed. Indeed the best way to mitigate the risks facing that we face is to improve the resilience of the economy through competitiveness orientated policies and prudent management of the public finances.</p></reply>

As a result, there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2020 my Department will publish updated forecasts next month. </p>  <p>  In an EU context, Ireland remains one of the fastest growing Member States. The strong growth and performance seen in our economy is also clearly illustrated by a comparison with the performance of our main trading partners &ndash; the Euro Area, the UK and the US. </p>  <p>  For the Euro Area the European Commission is forecasting growth of 1.2 per cent this year, and 1.4 per cent next year. The GDP forecast for the EU28 is for growth of 1.4 per cent in 2019 and 1.6 per cent in 2020. This represents a significant slowdown from the growth rates seen in 2015-2017.</p>  <p>  The performance of individual Member States is diverging with some areas (e.g. Central and Eastern Europe, Malta, and Ireland) expanding faster than others (e.g. Italy, Germany).</p>  <p>  For the UK, modest GDP growth of 1.3 per cent is expected this year and 1.4 per cent next year, based on a technical assumption of status quo in terms of trading relations between the EU27 and the UK. </p>  <p>  The US economy continues to benefit from several tailwinds, supporting GDP growth of 2.6 per cent is expected this year, although this is expected to moderate to 1.9 per cent in 2020 as fiscal stimulus unwinds.</p>  <p>  In common with Ireland, there has been a recovery in employment growth in all our main export markets &ndash; though at a more modest pace &ndash; with a corresponding reduction in unemployment. </p></reply>

In addition, regular updates of my Department&rsquo;s Macro-Economic forecasts take account of the impact of Brexit.</p><p>The UK is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important trading partners. In 2017 the Department of Finance published a paper on <i>trade exposures</i>which shows that relative to other EU Member States, Irish exports are substantially more exposed to the UK in a number of goods sectors. </p><p>The top five most exposed included the Irish agri-food sub-sectors Cereals, Vegetables and Fruit, and Live Animal products. In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services. </p><p>The paper also finds that the share of exports going to the UK has increased in a number of sectors over the past 15 years, including the agri-food sector, contrary to the trend decline in the importance of the UK as export destination for overall Irish exports.</p><p>The most recent Contingency Action Plan was published in July set out in detail the Government&rsquo;s analysis of the risks and impacts of a no deal outcome across 26 key areas. It underlines that Brexit will have profound and highly disruptive implications for Ireland, and sets out in detail the short-term risks associated with that. </p><p>Maintaining the closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK is therefore one of the Government&rsquo;s key Brexit priorities. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. </p><p>Longer-term, we need to mitigate against the potential of regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards given its potential implications for trade, investment and the competitiveness of our businesses. We will therefore be working to minimise this impact and to ensure a level playing field. </p><p>Since the referendum result in 2016, we have been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our fiscal buffers &ndash; by balancing our books and reducing our debt burden - and establishing the Rainy Day Fund. </p><p>The Government is continuing to work to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the Future Jobs Ireland Strategy and the 10-year National Development Plan. In addition, recent budgets have introduced specific initiatives, such as loan supports for agri-businesses, aimed at supporting those businesses most affected by Brexit. The Brexit Loan Scheme assists firms to adapt and innovate in response to Brexit, to restructure their cost bases and give them the opportunity to diversify into other markets thereby reducing their exposure to the UK. The Future Growth Loan Scheme provides a longer-term scheme facility of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. </p><p>The Government has also stepped up engagement with stakeholders across all sectors through targeted events and media campaigns aimed at getting both business and citizens Brexit ready. Our planning at home and at the EU level for all possible outcomes has increased and will continue to intensify. </p><p>Department of Finance (2017) <i>Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context</i>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.164.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600037#WRC04300"><p>The Irish insurance sector is diverse, comprising life, non-life and reinsurance firms providing a range of products and operating across a number of geographical markets.  As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation of the sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  </p>  <p>  These are to: </p>  <p>  - establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by Central Bank of Ireland);</p>  <p>  - establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FOE); or</p>  <p>  - operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FOS), i.e. conduct business in Ireland from another country.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are companies operating in each of these channels in the Irish insurance market.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of access to markets within the EU, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation.  Therefore, it plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU. It also expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.</p>  <p>  With regard to comparing insurance costs across jurisdictions in Europe, Insurance Europe, the European (re)insurance federation, produces reports on an on-going basis regarding the insurance industry across Europe. For example, the European Insurance in Figures (2017 data) and the European Motor Insurance Markets, both published in early 2019, contain some useful comparative information in respect of insurance up to 2017. The European Insurance &mdash; Key Facts published in October 2018, graphs the average premium level across European countries for a variety of insurance products for the year 2017. The varying levels of premiums across Europe is accounted for by a wide range of regulatory, risk and economic factors which differ across European jurisdictions (as noted on p. 16 of the European Motor Insurance Markets).</p>  <p>  For example, other factors that may influence an insurance company&rsquo;s decision to operate or not in a particular country, could include the number of personal injury claims made, the level of awards granted, and the legal costs and time associated with settling/defending claims in that country. In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as the leisure, adventure and hospitality sectors where insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  Indeed, I understand that in recent meetings between Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, and a number of UK insurers/underwriters in London who have recently left the Irish insurance market, the reasons above were mentioned as to why they had made this decision.  Therefore, for these parts of the market, there is undoubtedly an issue around its attractiveness and this consequently has impacted on competitiveness.  </p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report which concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. The recently enacted Judicial Council Act 2019 provides for the establishment of this Council, which will allow for the recalibration, by the Judiciary, of award levels for personal injuries.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to establish the Judicial Council and the subsequent Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, it is my hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and will prioritise it accordingly by completing a first set of guidelines, which take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, as soon as possible.  At the same time, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has begun a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages, which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.</p>  <p>  I believe that the creation and implementation of the Personal Injuries guidelines by the Judiciary will result in the lowering of award levels.  As importantly, I believe it should lead to a greater consistency in award levels for injuries of the same type.  This therefore should mean that there will be less of an incentive for a person to litigate, as they should not be getting any more from a court award than a PIAB award, which in turn should have a significant impact on legal costs.  In summary, I believe that over time the clearest signal that these changes are working is when there is an increase in the number of PIAB cases being accepted by claimants particularly for minor and moderate injuries.  In addition, I believe that the cumulative effects of the completion of the CIWG recommendations will include greater stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and a more competitive insurance market overall.</p></reply>

GDP growth of 6 &frac12; per cent in the first half of the year and the relatively low rate of unemployment which stands at just over 5 per cent support this assessment.  However it is also clear that there are dark clouds on the horizon, with the external environment continuing to deteriorate, and the risk of an adverse shock to the economy - for instance through a disorderly Brexit &ndash; rising all the time.</p>  <p>  The macroeconomic projections published at Stability Programme Update (SPU) 2019 were based on the assumption the UK will leave the EU with a deal and that a transition &lsquo;status quo&rsquo; period would be agreed that extends or replicates existing frameworks until end-2020. However, since the publication of SPU the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal has increased substantially. To reflect this, for budgetary purposes, the Government has decided to base Budget 2020 on the assumption of a 'no-deal' Brexit.</p>  <p>  In order to quantify the effects of a disorderly Brexit, my Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) recently published an updated model-based assessment of the economic impacts. The report found that in aggregate terms compared to a scenario in which the UK did not leave the EU the level of GDP would be 3 per cent lower after 5 years. The impact is expected to be greatest in the first year which is primarily explained by higher trade costs with the UK reducing the level of overall trade and short run disruption due to uncertainty. </p>  <p>  Despite these impacts, the Irish economy is still expected to grow but at a slower pace as a consequence of Brexit. As part of Budget 2020 my Department will publish updated macroeconomic forecasts which will be based on the assumption that the UK leaves the EU without a deal.  </p>  <p>  Of course Brexit isn&rsquo;t the only risk faced by the economy. As a small open economy Ireland is particularly exposed to a slowdown in growth in key export markets, with a loss of momentum particularly evident in both the euro area and the UK in recent quarters.  </p>  <p>  The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies.</p></reply>

Unfortunately, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can compel any insurer to provide cover or to provide it at a particular price. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. Consequently, the Government cannot direct insurance companies to cover certain types of risk, such as that related to sports and leisure bodies.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.</p><p>That is not to say, that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the Cost of Motor Insurance Report<i></i>and the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report.  Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:</p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales;</p><p>- The enactment of the Judicial Council Act 2019, in July which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;</p><p>- The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;</p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The Bank is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;</p><p>- Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;</p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality.</p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to sports and leisure bodies.</p><p>I believe it is important to emphasise that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council in the coming months is very important in this regard.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputies that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a results of the operationalisation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the issues that are being experienced by sports and leisure bodies should recede.</p></reply>

This commitment stems from recommendations made in the Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code by Mr Seamus Coffey.  </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations in that Review is that consideration be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs, having regard to whether the associated burden of keeping transfer pricing documentation would be proportional to the risks of transfer mispricing occurring.</p>  <p>  As part of the process of updating Ireland's transfer pricing rules, my Department recently published Ireland&rsquo;s Transfer Pricing Rules Feedback Statement to enable consultation with stakeholders on the approach I propose to take to meeting the commitments made in this area. </p>  <p>  Being mindful of not imposing an undue administrative burden on SMEs, the Feedback Statement signals a proposed approach towards how transfer pricing rules could be applied to SMEs.  That approach proposes that smaller enterprises will not be required to provide any transfer pricing documentation and that medium enterprises will only be required to provide simplified transfer pricing documentation in respect of very material cross border transactions with associated persons.  I believe that this would strike an appropriate balance between the risk of mispricing and the compliance burden imposed. </p>  <p>  Application of transfer pricing rules to SMEs, but with relaxed documentation requirements, is consistent with the approach adopted in many other OECD countries.  Also, of note, where the associated person who is the other party to the transaction is located in a country which has transfer pricing rules, it is likely that there is already a requirement for the group to prepare transfer pricing documentation in relation to the transaction in that other country.  Therefore, providing transfer pricing documentation in Ireland may not be a significant burden for many medium enterprises. </p>  <p>  The Feedback Statement also proposes that the provisions for SMEs would not be commenced at the same time as the rest of the transfer pricing provisions.  The rationale behind this approach is to ensure that SMEs do not face any additional compliance burden next year given other uncertainties faced by business at this time. This will have the added benefit of providing a window to allow SMEs to fully consider and understand how the application of transfer pricing rules could impact them and prepare for that eventuality.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is unable to provide exact figures for the number of Irish SMEs that could be impacted by transfer pricing rules.  However, Revenue estimate that approximately 1,500 companies from over 50 groups could be brought within the scope of the new rules when they eventually come into effect for SMEs.  Revenue advise that it does not have estimated figures available for the number of employees working for SMEs that could potentially come within the scope of transfer pricing rules.  Given that it is not intended to commence the extension of transfer pricing rules to SMEs in 2020, there are no immediate impacts on the tax yield as a result.</p></reply>

Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2019/2020 academic year.</p>  <p>  For student grant purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students. An applicant's class is defined at his/her first point of entry to an approved higher or further education course and this will continue to apply for the duration of his/her studies. </p>  <p>  For a dependent student, the reckonable income for grant purposes includes both his/her own income and that of his/her parents/legal guardians. </p>  <p>  A student may be assessed as an independent mature student if he or she has attained the age of 23 on the 1st January of the year of first entry to an approved course, or of re-entry following a break in studies of at least three years, and is not ordinarily resident with his/her parents from the previous October. Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p>  <p>  The re-entry provision of the scheme allows mature students who have previously attended an approved course and are now entering an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, to have their status reclassified from dependent to independent student.</p>  <p>  In terms of other supports, the main support is the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available to students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need. This Fund assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.  </p>  <p>  Tax relief also is available on postgraduate tuition fees.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Blanchardstown_West_Dublin15 and BlanchardstownVge_Dublin15 school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The application process for patrons to run this school has been completed. </p>  <p>  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Waterville is located in the adjacent Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2014 to serve the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area and had just over 600 pupils enrolled in the 2018/19 school year.</p>  <p>  While the recent announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Teacher Supply Steering Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is considering the issues that impact on teacher supply in a number of policy areas. The Group is overseeing the delivery of the Teacher Supply Action Plan, which I published in November 2018. In undertaking its task, the Group is cognisant of the requirement that all persons wishing to teach in recognised schools must meet the professional registration standards and criteria set by the Teaching Council, which is the professional regulatory body for the teaching profession. I hope to be in a position to announce further measures to support the supply of teachers over the coming months.</p><p>A number of measures which support the supply of teachers to Irish-medium schools have been introduced as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022<i>.</i>This includes the commencement in 2018 of a new Irish-medium Masters in Education (M.Ed.) for primary and post-primary teachers, including principals, in Mary Immaculate College and the commencement in 2019 of a new 4-year Irish-medium Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) for primary teachers in Marino Institute of Education.  The new programmes provide for up to 60 new places for teacher education through Irish annually. Additional staffing has also been provided for the Professional Masters in Education (PME) in NUI, Galway to increase the supply of post-primary teachers who can deliver high quality Irish medium education across a range of subjects. </p><p>For Leaving Certificate Examination, candidates shall, except where otherwise directed, have the option of answering either in Irish or in English, except in the case of the subjects Irish and English and questions in other language subjects where the use of the target language is specified. </p><p>Candidates will be supplied with Irish or English versions of the examination papers as indicated on their entry forms. Candidates who have indicated in the examination entry process that they intend to answer through Irish are initially suppled with the Irish version of the paper only (by default). The English version may subsequently also be given to them by the superintendent at the request of the candidate.</p><p>Allowing provision of the paper in both languages allows them to check they have correctly interpreted any question asked of them by cross-referencing it with the paper in the other language. </p><p>A candidate who answers in Irish at the written examination in the various subjects may be given bonus marks in addition to the marks gained in the subject. </p><p>Candidates who answer partly in Irish and partly in English will receive no bonus marks. </p></reply>

The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on 9 April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim in respect of grant-funded secretaries.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys in respect of both caretakers and secretaries on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim.  This is standard practice.  </p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis.</p></reply>

Many choose not to do so and make other arrangements.  Consideration of a person's international protection application is not affected by their accommodation arrangements provided that they keep the Department informed of their current accommodation address.</p><p>Accommodation, where required, is provided under the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018 which came in to effect in June 2018. A person offered accommodation under the Regulations is required to comply with the house rules of the accommodation centre.</p><p>Part of the role of both the International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department and individual accommodation centre management is to ensure that those who request and are allocated accommodation within the IPAS portfolio access it on a consistent basis.  House rules require residents to keep the centre management informed if they are to be absent overnight.  Regular absences would indicate that the person is not living there in the normal course. Clearly if a person is allocated accommodation but ceases using it consistently, it would be wrong not to re-allocate it to an international protection applicant who genuinely requires it.</p><p>When it comes to the attention of IPAS that a resident does not appear to be using their accommodation allocation consistently, and the person has not given centre management an explanation as to why this is the case, IPAS staff liaise with centre management to manage the situation.  In a case where IPAS is satisfied that accommodation is not being used consistently, the resident will be issued a letter advising them that if they do not use their accommodation space, that space will be re-allocated to another applicant in need.  If the resident continues to be absent from their accommodation without explanation, a letter will be sent to them (at that centre), advising them that their accommodation space has been deemed abandoned and will be reallocated to another protection applicant.  This letter will be held by management until the person presents in the centre to collect their post. </p><p>It is open to residents to respond to the initial letter and provide any evidence that they are indeed availing of the accommodation. If IPAS is satisfied that this is the case then the matter will be closed at that stage and the accommodation will not be reallocated.  Once the final letter is issued, advising the resident that the space has been deemed abandoned, the matter will not be re-opened for consideration.  However, they resident can, if they choose, apply in writing to RIA asking to be re-accommodated.  However, a subsequent offer of accommodation may not be for the same accommodation centre as had previously been provided.</p></reply>

To facilitate payments to the constituent organisations, Enterprise Ireland have developed new consortia agreements and a new pre-finance framework was put in place. Letters of offer and consortia agreements have now issued to all of the successful project partners. Payments to those organisations, including those that are eligible for pre-financing, are being processed once the formal legal documentation is signed off and returned to Enterprise Ireland.

It is a significant investment by this Government in research, development and innovation in Ireland with an allocation of &euro;500 million in the period to 2027. Call 1 of the DTIF opened on 29 June 2018 and 27 successful projects were announced on 10 December 2018. In total, over &euro;75 million of Government funding was committed to 104 separate organisations within these 27 collaborative projects over a three-year period. From the start, my Department has indicated that &euro;20 million would be made available in 2019 to commence the first tranche of projects. That funding is currently being drawn down and it is expected that it will be allocated in full against profile by the end of the year. For the most part, enterprise partners in DTIF collaborations will draw down funding retrospectively following the submission of validated claims for vouched expenditure.</p>  <p>  As regards certain commercial activity not being funded, my Department officials engaged in extensive dialogue with our agencies in advance of defining the eligibility criteria for Call 1 of the DTIF to ensure compliance with the provisions of the General Block Exemption Regulation scheme for R&amp;D funding and to the national legislation under which funding is provided. When DTIF Call 1 opened in June 2018, those rules were included in the call documentation published on my Department's website. For Call 1, project bids that focused on "industrial research" were sought in order to provide clarity to applicants and to provide the optimal rate of State support across the board to all eligible companies (i.e. 50% matched funding). All successful projects were awarded funding subject to contract negotiations and complying with these State Aid rules. Whilst some commercialisation costs were allowed, not all were allowable due to these rules.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is administering DTIF Call 1 on my behalf and, given the unique nature of the Fund, it needed to develop new consortia agreements to facilitate payments to constituent organisations. EI has engaged in intensive contract negotiations with participants in each project, checking that costs submitted were eligible under these State Aid rules and also justifiable for the work packages involved.</p>  <p>  As regards the pre-financing of certain project costs, the DTIF Call 1 guidance document had indicated that pre-finance of up to one-third, subject to certain criteria, could be made available to small companies only, in line with the legislation governing the enterprise agencies of my Department. EI established a new process for assessing pre-finance applications for the DTIF. This process is now in place and payments to the SMEs approved for pre-finance are being processed once the formal legal documentation is signed off and returned to EI.  </p>  <p>  Collaborations of the scale and nature funded through the DTIF are a first for Ireland. Due to the unique nature of the Fund and the complexities involved, it has taken longer than anticipated to put the necessary arrangements in place and to conclude contract negotiations with all 104 organisations. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that this is causing difficulties for a number of organisations involved but I am very pleased to see the overwhelming support for this new Fund from small and large companies and from across the research system.  We have taken the opportunity in Call 2 to refine our rules and procedures based on learnings from Call 1 and I am confident that the DTIF will continue to be welcomed as a key instrument for Ireland in helping to embrace and prepare for the new wave of technologies that will underpin our economic development into the future.</p></reply>

That is why Government has intensified efforts over the last number of weeks and months to communicate with companies to get engagement and encourage them to take the necessary steps to be best prepared for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific initiative that the deputy refers to, I recently asked my officials to make contact with the 220,000 companies listed with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) to advise them of the array of supports and the organisations available to assist them with their Brexit preparations. </p>  <p>  This outreach was in fact specifically timed to coincide with the key filing period during which companies file their annual returns at the CRO. Companies typically file their annual returns from the start of October over a 4 week period. My initiative was designed in order to get maximum impact with companies visiting the CRO website during that key filing period.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative through the CRO was just one of the many channels and campaigns that my Department has been engaged in to communicate with businesses to get out the key messages in terms of steps they need to take to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition, the enterprise and regulatory agencies under my Department have been working closely with businesses for months through their own engagement campaigns and client clinics. These include Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Boards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), the Health and Safety Authority, the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB), the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as well as Intertrade Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 4 September, with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister McEntee, I launched the &lsquo;Getting Your Business Brexit Ready: Practical Steps Guide&rsquo; which focuses on the nine steps every business should take regardless of its size.  This guide is available on www.gov.ie/brexit, along with other useful information for companies. </p>  <p>  I recently collaborated with the Accountancy Bodies of Ireland on four breakfast Brexit briefing events covering a number of counties in the border regions that are likely to be most impacted by Brexit.  These Brexit events covered a broad range of important topics to help businesses prepare for Brexit such as customs, supply chain, cashflow and accreditation. </p>  <p>  Across all Government Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport as well as Government agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and other regulatory bodies, work has been ongoing and intensified over the summer period to engage with businesses to ensure that they are taking the necessary steps to meet the challenges of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently running a number of outreach events with the first event taking place in Dublin on 10 September, and a further two events planned for Wexford on 27 September and in Cork on 30 September.  </p>  <p>  During the summer months, Revenue wrote to over 90,000 businesses in relation to new customs procedures that will apply post Brexit including the need to register with Revenue for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI) to allow them to continue trading with the UK. </p>  <p>  Through these various engagements and others, it is Government's clear intention to ensure that businesses are as well prepared as possible for Brexit, whenever that happens.</p></reply>

My priority is to ensure our current and future business environment becomes more straightforward, while providing sufficient resources to aid these businesses to develop the tools they need to succeed, grow and create sustainable employment.  </p>  <p>  To determine the current climate of our enterprise ecosystem, I commissioned the OECD to conduct a Country Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policies in Ireland in March 2018. The timescale for this review was 18 months and the final Report will be launched in Dublin by myself and the OECD Deputy Secretary General on the 23rd of October.  The outcome of the review aims to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to Government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies, and informed by international comparisons.</p>  <p>  My Department has played a central role supporting and facilitating the OECD during this intensive process. My officials have organised stakeholder events throughout the process to-date in order to facilitate detailed engagement between DBEI, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives and the small business sector. This engagement has enabled the OECD to gain insightful knowledge of our SME and entrepreneurship ecosystem at the various critical stages of building this report.</p>  <p>  The OECD review has comprehensively examined all aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s SME and Entrepreneurship ecosystem. The Report and the accompanying Strategy Roadmap will assist my Department in developing a national SME Strategy which will be aligned within the overall Future Jobs Framework. </p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact regulatory burdens and compliance costs can have on small businesses. Research indicates that where a large company may spend one euro per employee to comply with a regulatory duty, a medium-sized enterprise might have to spend around four euros and a small business up to ten euros. That is why my Department is leading on the development, roll out and implementation of the SME Test.</p>  <p>  The main thrust of the SME Test is to assess the potential for less stringent requirements for smaller companies and the simplification of regulatory adherence, for example through the use of templates, reduced thresholds for SMEs and use of plain English in forms.</p>  <p>  My Department sought best practice through other EU Member States regarding the development of the SME Test and a guidance approach was taken. In 2017, consultation took place with the Advisory Group on Small Business, which my colleague Minister of State Pat Breen TD chaired, and a public consultation followed thereafter.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the application and use of the SME Test across Government is now a deliverable action in the Future Jobs 2019 work programme. The adoption of the Test is included under action 2.3 which states:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Raise awareness and promote the SME Test throughout Government Departments. Workshops will be available for policymakers&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In July 2019, my colleague Minister Breen wrote to each Government Department in his role as Minister of State for Business requesting that policymakers and those responsible for drafting relevant legislation in each Department utilise the Test. The nomination of a relevant official in each Department has also been sought so that my Department can engage and assist with the adoption of the SME Test in practice.  </p>  <p>  As a country, we want our Irish SMEs continue to grow and prosper and to become more innovative. Accessing finance is an integral part for the growth of any business. That is why my Department oversees EU sponsored programmes providing our diverse range of SME businesses with alternative financial solutions to those already available in the current market.  </p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides loans between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 to start-ups and existing micro enterprises who may be experiencing difficulty in accessing credit from other commercial lenders. The Brexit Loan Scheme is a &euro;300 million loan fund available to eligible Irish businesses impacted by Brexit with loans available between &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and unsecured loans up to &euro;500,000. The &euro;40 million European Angel Fund is a joint initiative with the European Investment Fund designed to enhance the capacity of Business Angels to provide equity financing for innovative companies in the form of co-investments. </p>  <p>  SMEs who participate in the public procurement process will be very aware of the financial and promotional opportunities that come with successfully winning all or part of a Government tender.  Officials in my Department and that of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) work together throughout the year to ensure a strong focus is maintained on promoting awareness amongst the SME sector. This commitment is reinforced by way of my Department participating on the OGP&rsquo;s SME Procurement Advisory Group and their reciprocal participation in the DBEI chaired Interdepartmental SME Communication Group, which oversees the promotion of the www.supportingsmes.gov.ie website.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>   In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in secondary school.</p>  <p>   During the 2019/20 school year, girls who previously declined the HPV vaccine and are still attending secondary school can join the HPV girls only programme.  By contacting your local HSE Health Office appointments will be offered to girls to receive the HPV vaccine in HSE mop up clinics.  However, it must be noted that vaccinated girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p></reply>

The Scoping Inquiry was led by Dr Gabriel Scally, under Terms of Reference which are published on the website of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Scoping Inquiry produced a First, Final and Supplementary Report. In total these reports set out 58 recommendations for improvements in our screening programmes and wider health services. These reports are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Scoping Inquiry, published in September 2018, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected. However, Dr Scally is clear that the Inquiry is satisfied with the quality management processes in the labs contracted by CervicalCheck. His reports present no evidence that the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme. Crucially, he confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced. This provided welcome reassurance for women in Ireland, given the importance of screening for women&rsquo;s health.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Report, published on 11 June 2019, addressed issues relating, broadly, to laboratories used for CervicalCheck screening, including the use of additional sites, laboratory accreditation schemes, and procurement and contracting of laboratory services by CervicalCheck. The Report identified issues in regard to contractual compliance, in particular the use of additional sites for screening of CervicalCheck sites without CervicalCheck&rsquo;s knowledge; procurement, including a reduced focus on quality in procurement; and contracting. However, the Supplementary Report stated that, on the basis of the information available to the Inquiry, the use of additional laboratories did not in fact result in a reduction in the quality of the screening provided to Irish women and there is no evidence to suggest deficiencies in screening quality in any laboratory.</p>  <p>  Dr Scally confirmed to me in July this year that the work of the Scoping Inquiry is concluded. Government has accepted all 58 of the recommendations that were set out in Dr Scally&rsquo;s three reports into CervicalCheck. An implementation plan was approved by Government in December 2018 and work is ongoing in my Department, the HSE and the National Cancer Registry of Ireland on the range of actions within the Plan. </p>  <p>  Dr Scally carried out a review of the implementation plan earlier this year, at my request, and he affirmed that the Implementation Plan is a comprehensive response to his report. He was clear that significant effort and resources are being committed to addressing the problems he identified and has acknowledged that substantial and important progress has been made to date in implementation of his recommendations. Quarterly reports against implementation are published on the website of my Department. </p>  <p>  I have requested Dr Scally to undertake a further review of implementation of his recommendations, and this work is ongoing. Dr Scally has stated that he is confident that the recommendations which he has made are already facilitating the development of a cervical screening service that, in international terms, will be outstanding.</p>  <p>  Also currently underway, following the Government decision in May 2018, is an Independent Clinical Expert Panel Review of cervical screening. This is being carried out by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), and will provide women with independent assurance about the timing of their diagnosis and treatment. Every woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer since September 2008, whose cancer was registered with the National Cancer Registry of Ireland before 5 May 2018, and who had one or more tests under the CervicalCheck programme, was offered a review of her case.</p>  <p>  As noted in a guidance document produced by Public Health England, "no matter how closely a review tries to reproduce the original screening conditions, the conditions of a review are different", and hence it is normally expected that any review such as this will have review results which disagree with their original review result (discordance). This is in line with international experience. For planning purposes, the HSE is estimating that up to 40% of participants may be identified by the RCOG Panel as having discordance.</p>  <p>  Earlier this month the HSE sent a letter to all participants in the review to provide an update about the process, and to advise participants of when they may expect to receive their individual reports. This letter also provided women with options about how they may choose to receive their report. The feedback from participants has been positive, both in relation to the information pack and the options for receiving results. Women have started to receive their results and it is expected that the process will take a number of months to complete.</p>  <p>  The Royal College will also prepare an aggregate report for the Minister, which will include recommendations, where appropriate, on improving care for women. The Royal College wrote to the Minister on the 6th of September last advising that, based on the provisional findings of its Review, the performance characteristics of the CervicalCheck Screening Programme that fall within the scope of the Review appear to be broadly in line with the experience in the UK.</p></reply>

This marks a welcome milestone for the programme. All smear tests are now being read at two laboratories, the Coombe and Quest Diagnostics.  As of 30 August, the HSE reported that average turnaround times for the Coombe and Quest were 4 weeks and 5 weeks respectively, and 96% of tests were being resulted within 7 weeks. </p>  <p>  As the turnaround times for smear test results may fluctuate somewhat from week-to-week, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy with the most up-to-date figures available.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>   As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.</p>  <p>   Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to NHSS budget for the continued provision of services in line with pricing and demand. As part of normal governance and performance management arrangements The Department and the HSE maintain regular service area engagements, which also form part of ongoing collaborative work on issues relating to older persons policy and service delivery. </p>  <p>  The HSE have noted that the number of residents in nursing homes whom are supported by the NHSS to be ahead of forecast for the year to date. The latest available performance reports indicate that there are 23,236 people supported in the Scheme at the end of July this year. This is significantly more people than forecast and this creates a challenge. The HSE has also advised that the cost of care continues to rise and the average weekly cost per bed is higher in 2019 than anticipated.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation. The HSE cannot legally fund clients beyond the determined funding allocation, and the appropriate mechanism relating to funding allocations is through the estimates and budgetary process. To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget. </p>  <p>  The HSE has put in place arrangements that a monthly analysis of performance of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme continues to ensure that the maximum number of new entrants are approved with the shortest possible waiting times while remaining on track to deliver a balanced budgetary position by year end. In the context of planning for the winter months, the HSE released a significant number of funding approvals this month bringing the waiting time for the release of funding back to 3 to 4 weeks.</p></reply>

Patients in Ireland can seek to be referred to another EU/EEA member state, including Northern Ireland, for medical treatment that is available in the public health service in Ireland. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the EU/EEA member state they choose to receive the service in. The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that at present there are no changes to patient care in the UK and Northern Ireland under the CBD, as the UK continues to be a full member of the EU. Indeed, until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full Member with all its existing rights and obligations. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, as part of a whole of Government response to Brexit, my Department is working to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated set of preparations to ensure continuity of health services post-Brexit.  This includes the enactment of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019.

On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:</p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.    </p>  <p>  Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will also provide direct protection to boys against HPV-related disease.  It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.  Another important factor includes the additional protection provided by a gender neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men) and the potential to improve the resilience of the immunisation programme to fluctuations in vaccine uptake and to the movement of individuals into and out of the country.</p>  <p>  For older children who did not receive the vaccine as part of the School Immunisation Programme the HPV vaccine can only be obtained privately from a GP.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected.

As such, they are recognised as valuable landscape features under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and thus are eligible for BPS payments. It is also recognised that such features must be appropriately managed and maintained by appropriate trimming to keep them in optimum condition, both as field boundary features and to help maintain the optimum structure and thickness to encourage bird nesting etc., and best practice prevails where this is done as part of an appropriate cutting rotation. </p>  <p>  Their importance is further recognised through the inclusion of a number of hedgerow-specific actions within the GLAS (Agri-environment Scheme under pillar II). In addition, farmers in GLAS can select the action of coppicing of hedges and/or laying of hedges which seek to improve the biodiversity value of escaped or abandoned hedges.</p>  <p>  The restriction on cutting hedgerows set out in Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 as amended by the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 and the Heritage Act 2018 falls under the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>  <p>  As regards the new regulations for the CAP 2021-27 which were launched in June 2018 by Commissioner Hogan, the proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments.   </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the draft proposals are continuing at EU level. While significant progress has been made to date, decisions on key issues have yet to be agreed at EU level.  </p></reply>

There has been a prolonged and exceptional period of depressed prices since autumn 2018, with the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, among other factors, contributing to this market disturbance.</p>  <p>  The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM), which recently closed for applications, will provide temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. BEAM is funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support, provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of the market volatility and uncertainty.  Over 34,500 farmers had applied for BEAM at its closing date of 20 September, representing potential commitments of almost &euro;78 million.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current RDP period. </p>  <p>  This year, I introduced the exchequer-funded Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), a &euro;20 million scheme which will provide suckler farmers with valuable data on the weaning efficiency of their animals.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for beef farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Sheep and suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.</p>  <p>  In recognising the major challenges faced by the farming sector and the important role that various schemes operated by my Department play in underpinning the viability of many farms, last month I secured agreement from the European Commission that will allow for a higher rate of advance payments under the 2019 Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and a number of Rural Development Schemes. </p>  <p>  Additionally, I have secured a funding increase to the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) Scheme which brings the total budget this year to &euro;250m.  On foot of changes to EU Regulations, payments under the ANC Scheme will be made in two instalments this year.  The initial instalment of 85% worth &euro;168.5m was paid to almost 79,000 farmers last week, with the balancing payments of 15% commencing in early December.  These supports provide a major injection of funds to the suckler and sheep sector at an important time.</p>  <p>  As regards the sheep sector, I introduced the Sheep Welfare Scheme in December 2016 in order to provide support for sheep farmers in improving welfare standards in the national sheep flock.  Participating farmers are paid &euro;10 per eligible ewe, and some &euro;36m issued to farmers in respect of the first two years of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to supports which are available for sheep farmers under the Rural Development Programme, including GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups, sheep farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  I have also made available financial support to sheep farmers for compliance with new sheep EID rules of &euro;100 per farmer and I would like to remind farmers that the closing date for the Sheep EID Tag Subsidy Scheme is 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is a constant and central component of the strategic development of the industry, as evidenced by its placement at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development. Food Wise 2025 prioritises the potential for growth in new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. </p>  <p>  Following my visit to Japan in June, the Japanese market was opened for Irish sheepmeat and the Deputy will be aware of the recent audit visit by Chinese officials to a number of sheep slaughtering plants as part of the on-going efforts to secure access to the Chinese market for Irish sheepmeat. </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that beef and sheep farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.</p>  <p>  The premises referenced by the Deputy is located in the AMBER area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p>  <p>  The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. In May I brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p>  <p>  The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close. The finalisation of financial closure and legal requirements are progressing towards contract award. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p>  <p>  The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p>  <p>  A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's reference to a nearby commercial deployment of high speed broadband, this relates to eir's deployment of high speed broadband to 300,000 rural premises which has concluded its deployment in that area. eir&rsquo;s deployment is an entirely commercial undertaking, and not part of the planned State Intervention network. Although the deployment is monitored under the terms of a Commitment Agreement signed between the company and my Department, it is not funded by the State and it is not planned, designed or directed by my Department in any capacity. </p>  <p>  Decisions made by private telecommunication operators relating to the roll out and siting of infrastructure to provide high speed broadband services throughout Ireland are undertaken on a commercial basis. I have no statutory role or function in such commercial decisions of private operators, and therefore cannot direct operators regarding infrastructure installation or delivery of services. </p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p></reply>

The latest registers compiled by the NTFSO deal with 2018 and are available at  </p><p>The Waste Shipment Regulation, Regulation (EC) No. 1013/2006, on transfrontier shipments of waste, sets out the procedures to be followed when moving waste within, into and out of the EU. The Waste Shipment Regulation already includes those procedures to be followed when sending materials to &ldquo;third countries&rdquo;. Under current UK policy, waste is not permitted to travel between the EU and the UK for disposal and this will continue to be the case after Brexit. This is further enhanced by the provisions of the Waste Shipment Regulation which states &lsquo;all exports of waste from the Community destined for disposal shall be prohibited&rsquo;. Any waste travelling to or from Ireland to the UK for recycling or recovery will not be affected. In practical terms, there will be no change to current procedures or the paperwork used to organise shipments of waste so additional costs do not arise in this context.</p><p>Under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, which the UK will remain party to post Brexit, international shipments of waste are controlled through a process of prior written consent. This allows countries exporting waste to verify that the authorities in destination countries are content to accept the proposed shipment and that the waste can be managed in an environmentally sound manner at its final destination. The OECD decision, which again the UK will remain party to post Brexit, provides the control framework for the transboundary movement of waste between OECD countries for energy recovery and recycling. The fundamental purpose of this system is to ensure that not only is waste moved to another country with that country&rsquo;s advance knowledge, but that wastes from developed countries are not dumped in developing nations.</p></reply>

In late 2018, my Department approved an Addis Ababa - Madrid - Dublin return service, with Madrid being a technical stop only.  This was changed to a fifth freedom service for the summer 2019 season, once all aeronautical authorities granted approval.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently received a formal application from Ethiopian Airlines to operate an Addis Ababa - Brussels - Dublin with return service for the winter 2019 season. This would replace the Madrid 5th freedom route. The Department is currently initiating a process of stakeholder engagement and evaluation before determining whether or not to grant an authorisation for this service. </p>  <p>  Addis Ababa is a growing access hub on the African continent and the air services operated by Ethiopian Airlines are Irelands only direct flights to that continent. As such, this factors strongly in the evaluation of any application for 5th freedom services. </p>  <p>  Ireland traditionally has a liberal aviation policy and remains positively disposed towards the development of competitive air services. In that context, my Department will continue to consider applications for fifth freedom air traffic rights under bilateral air services agreements, on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

An efficient and low emitting public transport system is a key priority in helping the transport sector contribute towards meeting our climate change goals. As part of a comprehensive programme of work to &lsquo;green&rsquo; our transport system, investment in public and sustainable transport to support modal shift and accommodate growing travel demand has been substantially increased in recent years.</p><p>In Project Ireland 2040, &euro;8.6billion has been indicatively allocated over the period 2018 to 2027 towards the delivery of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system. Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to private car travel, not only to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, but also to enable the sector to cater for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment in a greener and more environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>This funding will be provided for major programmes and projects, including MetroLink, the DART Expansion programme and BusConnects, with continued investment in bus fleet expansion, Local Link services, maintenance and renewal of heavy rail, as well as the multi-annual urban cycling and walking infrastructure investment of over &euro;110 million underway for our main cities. </p><p>Within the umbrella figure of &euro;8.6 billion, it is estimated that <i>c</i>. &euro;2 billion will be spent on the delivery of the Dublin BusConnects programme, with a further <i>c</i>. &euro;200 million respectively to be spent to deliver Cork and Galway BusConnects. This programme is expected to have a transformative effect on the operation of public bus services, enabling more people to travel by public and sustainable transport than ever before.</p><p>My strong commitment to transition our public transport fleet away from fossil fuels towards cleaner technologies was recently reaffirmed in the all-of-Government Climate Action Plan<i>. </i>The first one hundred low-emission buses will enter the urban bus fleet by the end of 2020. By 2023, under the BusConnects Programme, approximately half of the public urban bus fleet in the Greater Dublin Area will be low-emitting, with full conversion by 2030.</p><p>A similar comprehensive programme of work is underway to move the commuter rail fleet to low-emitting alternatives. We plan to electrify key heavily-used elements of the rail network by creating a full metropolitan area DART network for the Greater Dublin Area, which is the part of the national rail network that carries over 75% of total rail passengers each year. It will mean high-frequency electrified rail services to Drogheda, Celbridge/Hazelhatch, Maynooth and M3 Parkway, as well as new interchange stations with bus, LUAS and Metro networks. The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are undertaking a procurement process for the establishment of a 10-year framework agreement for the purchase of the additional lower-emitting rail fleet required for this expansion of the DART network. </p><p>Our movement to low-emission alternatives for public transport will be important in helping to promote and normalise the use of alternative fuels and technologies in the transport sector.  The measures will mitigate the carbon footprint of the public transport fleet, which currently accounts for less than 5% of Ireland's annual transport sector emissions (or roughly 1% of our overall emissions).  By maintaining a focus on expanding the carrying capacity of our public transport over the coming years, we can help address the largest sustainability challenge in the transport sector - which is shifting more journeys from private motoring towards suitable alternatives in public transport and active travel.</p></reply>

This measure refined the development introduced in 2017 and increased the eligibility of each registered child on ECCE from an average of 61 weeks, to a potential 76 weeks (two programme years). This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p><p>The minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit remains the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they will be 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).</p><p>In order for a child to be eligible to be enrolled for free pre-school in September 2020 they must have been born between 1 January 2017 - 31 December 2017, i.e. they must have reached 2 years and 8 months on or before 31 August 2018.</p><p>In the example cited by the Deputy, the child will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2020 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2020. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2021, and continue for a further year from September 2022, commencing school in September 2023.</p><p>Some parents/guardians may prefer for their child to start school at age 4 rather than 5. These parents/guardians may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. This decision is entirely at the discretion of the parent/s or guardians but it is important to reiterate that two full years of ECCE provision is available to all children.</p><p>It should be noted that the National Childcare Scheme will launch on 29th October 2019 and income-assessed subsidies will be available to families with children aged between 24 months and 15 years. This is a means-tested subsidy and is calculated based on a family's circumstances. The rate will vary depending on the level of family income, the child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family. Further details of the new scheme are available on the National Childcare Scheme website </p></reply>

As you are aware, such services are provided in Ireland by private services and not by my Department or the State. </p><p>The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November 2018 and relates to the 2017/2018 programme year, provides my Department with valuable information. It indicates that existing childcare provision nationally broadly meets current needs in terms of capacity, whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply exist within this. </p><p>The following table shows the capacity (both community and private) for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area.</p><p>Pobal do not record this data by individual area/district, both areas referred to come under the Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Childcare Committee area of responsibility. In addition Pobal do not distinguish between community and private providers when recording capacity.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Capacity &ndash;  all age ranges (enrolled + vacancies)</th><th>Vacant places</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>6,581</td><td>224</td></tr></table></p><p>There is a total of 188 childcare services in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, of which 23 (12%) are community services. Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Childcare Committee may be able to provide you or any parent with more assistance if required.</p><p>As regards capacity more generally, the 117% increase in investment over the last four years has allowed us double the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school age childcare. it has also supported the sector to double the number of places available. I secured &euro;8.86m in capital funding for childcare in 2019 with the ultimate aim of benefiting parents and children through improving our childcare infrastructure and capacity. A particular focus is on expanding service provision for children under three years of age.  </p><p>Under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities. I am delighted that &euro;250 million in additional funding has been committed for the expansion of high quality, early learning and care and school age childcare over the duration of the Plan.</p><p>Finally, the draft Childminding Action Plan published recently, and currently out for consultation,  sets out Government's draft proposal to further improve access  to high quality and affordable childcare through childminders.

Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted by my Department to deliver the service.  </p>  <p>  The JobPath employment service commenced in 2015 and, under the terms of the contracts signed with the providers was to run for at least six years comprising two consecutive phases: phase one entailed four years&rsquo; of client referrals, while phase two entailed a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients were to be referred.  Therefore client referrals were due to cease on 31st December 2019. The contract included an option to extend the term of referrals for a period no greater than two years.</p>  <p>  This extension is important as it will ensure that the Government retains the necessary labour activation capacity to deal with any labour market uncertainty that arises as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition, it provides my Department with the opportunity review all contracted public employment services and to design and develop a comprehensive model that will incorporate various models of response and be fit for purpose for the Irish labour market from 2021 onwards.  </p>  <p>  As per the econometric review, JobPath has been and continues to be a successful service in providing a comprehensive and value for money activation service for the long-term unemployed. On this basis, my Department triggered the extension provisions of the existing contracts with the JobPath providers and secured agreement on the extension of these contracts on existing terms and conditions for a further twelve months.  </p>  <p>  This is not a renewal of the JobPath contracts but the execution of the extension clauses of the existing contracts.</p>  <p>  In order to assist my Department in designing and developing an appropriate  contracted public employment service model, external consultants are to be engaged and this procurement process is currently underway.</p></reply>

As of end of August 2019, there were 82,233 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance and 2,967 beneficiaries of Carer's Benefit.  The projected combined expenditure on Carer's Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit in 2019 is approximately &euro;878 million.  </p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. Both the full-time care and attention requirement and the 15-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2006, the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  </p>  <p>  The only social welfare scheme with a criteria of 19 hours is the Working Family Payment (WFP).  A threshold of 19 hours (or 38 hours per fortnight) is applied as a minimum for the Working Family Payment.  It should be noted that, for WFP purposes, any combination of hours that reaches 38 hours each fortnight is acceptable. A person can combine their weekly hours with their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's hours to meet the condition.  Therefore a carer&rsquo;s working hours can be taken into account for WFP purposes.  </p>  <p>  In assessing weekly family income for Working Family Payment (WFP) purposes, most weekly social welfare payments are assessed.  Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments. Moreover, while this measure reduced a person&rsquo;s secondary payment (WFP) it did so without affecting their primary payment, in this case Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, therefore targeting available resources at those in most need.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to this condition would need to be considered in a budgetary context and would also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the requirement to provide full-time care for the care recipient and the needs of the carer.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the scheme in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and scheme rules as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements that apply to these schemes.  Trustees must act in the best financial interest of all scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially. If there is a conflict of interest then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests. </p>  <p>  Measures were introduced in 2015 to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members. Changes to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits. This affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits. These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the trustees of a pension scheme. Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a section 50 direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law. </p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority is the regulatory body charged with the supervision of pension schemes and has the necessary powers under statute to investigate the conduct of a pension scheme should it become aware that a scheme is not in compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act. Where a pension scheme member is of the view that the scheme is not in compliance with legislative requirements he or she may make a formal complaint to the Pensions Authority. </p>  <p>  Any questions relating to access to the State's industrial relations machinery is a matter for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Initial regulations in relation to schemes of priorities were made subsequently and further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters.</p><p>In order to support the delivery of discounted homes to buy or rent, this Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund, from 2019 to 2021, to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 homes.  To date, funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 13 local authority areas, has been allocated for infrastructure works on sites that will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes. </p><p>The overall cost and the timing of delivery for these projects is contingent upon the completion of design, planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.</p><p>In addition to making discounted homes available for purchase, the Government is also committed to the development of a new &lsquo;Cost Rental&rsquo; sector in Ireland. Under the Cost Rental model, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less both the profit margin seen in the private rental sector and any financial supports provided by the State/local authorities.  With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this would mean that many households on moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.</p><p>The rents for Cost Rental units will obviously depend upon the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. However, my Department has identified several factors that can put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants &ndash; these include low/zero land costs; a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind; and capital subvention to individual developments through the Serviced Sites Fund.</p><p>More competitive rental levels under the model can also be supported by accessing low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over an extended period of time. This long-term financing has, for example, been accessed via the European Investment Bank (EIB). </p><p>A pilot Cost rental project is currently on site in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, Co. Dublin. It involves a collaboration between the Department, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, Approved Housing Bodies, Respond and T&uacute;ath, and the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p>I officially launched the Enniskerry Road development earlier this month.  It comprises of 155 homes, a community facility, along with green spaces and car parking (including underground car parking).  The 155 homes include 50 cost rental units, all of which will be 2-bedroom apartments. It is anticipated that at &euro;1,200, rents for these units will be significantly below the market rates for the area.</p><p>While the cost rental element of this project is relatively small in scale (50 units), it will act as the first example of how this model can work in an Irish context, and will provide us with invaluable lessons when designing a larger-scale system. It will help to shape the contractual model and specifications for future larger-scale projects.</p><p>The second Cost Rental pilot project will be delivered on a Dublin City Council-owned site at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Emmet Road, Inchicore.  It is estimated that this site can accommodate over 470 homes in a high quality mixed tenure development. The current tenure mix as agreed with the Department will be 70% Cost Rental and 30% Social. </p><p>These new schemes are set in the context of significant moderation in the growth in house prices and complement other key Government affordability initiatives.  Included among these are the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, under which over 1,000 loans had been drawn down by end June this year, and the Help to Buy Scheme, under which some 14,000 applications have been approved.  In addition, the Land Development Agency's  initial portfolio of sites will have the potential to deliver 3,000 affordable homes and the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund ( LIHAF) will support more than 2,300 affordable homes on mainly publicly owned lands, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which have already come on stream.  Details of all SSF and LIHAF funded infrastructure projects can be found on the www.rebuildingireland.ie website at</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>In overall terms, programmes are in place under which some 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF-related reduction will be delivered, with 15,000 households already supported under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan or the Help to Buy Scheme.</p></reply>

In addition, the Government's commitment to the delivery of social housing homes is evident from the National Development Plan 2018-2027, which provides for the delivery of 112,000 new social homes over the next decade, supported by capital funding of &euro;11.6 billion.  </p><p>All local authorities are being funded to significantly increase their delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland and a strong social housing construction pipeline is in place for local authorities and approved housing bodies. National social housing delivery targets have been set under Rebuilding Ireland to 2021 and are publicly available on a local authority basis, on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:  .  Progress against these targets is tracked on a quarterly basis and details are published on my Department's website at .</p><p>The social housing delivery targets set for each local authority are in proportion to their waiting lists.  Accordingly, as progress is made by each authority against their delivery targets, this will proportionally benefit those on individual waiting lists.  The most recently available Summary of Social Housing Assessments relates to 2018 and, at national level, the number of households on the waiting list had decreased by 13,941 (-16.2%), compared to the previous assessment in June 2017, with 29 of the 31 local authorities reporting a decrease. </p><p>A strong social housing construction pipeline is in place and a detailed breakdown of this is contained in the Social Housing Construction Status Report which is updated and published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 2 2019 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at , providing project details of the social housing construction pipeline in place at that stage for all local authorities. </p><p>The Quarter 2 report reflected an increase in the scale of the social housing build programme, with over 1,500 schemes (or phases of schemes) in place, delivering over 22,000 new social housing homes. Of this total, over 7,300 new homes have already been delivered up to Quarter 2 of 2019, while over 6,400 additional new homes were under construction.  Over 2,700 further homes were at the final pre-construction stage and the remainder were progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement.</p><p>The timing, delivery and tenanting of schemes is a matter in the first place for each local authority. I am pleased to see the progress being made on projects, building on what has been already delivered, but I am keen that all local authorities further accelerate their programmes and I have assured them that the necessary funding is available to support their work in this regard.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-26a.557.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019092600044#WRK02500"><p>Since my Department started its Brexit planning, the question of the impact on the housing sector has been under consideration and has also been the subject of discussions at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  </p><p>The Government has indicated clearly, on foot of analysis undertaken, that the UK's exit from the European Union will have a detrimental impact on our economy and public finances, whatever form it takes. This may result in a lowering in the demand for housing. However, it is also possible that Brexit may impact net migration to Ireland in the short-term, particularly if a slow-down in the UK economy diverts a proportion of UK based-enterprises and employees as well as EU migrants who might otherwise have migrated to the UK, to Ireland. </p><p>Short-term phenomena, both immediately prior to and after a UK withdrawal from the EU, must be distinguished from the likely long-term picture.  The National Planning Framework is based on long-term, mid-range demographic and econometric projections over the period to 2040.  If a significant trend becomes apparent that is likely to continue in the long-run, national strategy would need to be reviewed accordingly.  In the meantime, the Rebuilding Ireland housing delivery target of 25,000 homes per annum by 2020 will be met, with the National Planning Framework, published in 2018, identifying a need for this number to increase to 30-35,000 homes in the years to 2027.  Any post-Brexit impact will be closely monitored and factored in accordingly.</p><p>In December 2018, the Government published its Contingency Action Plan which outlined the many risks of a no deal scenario, and the work underway at national and EU level to mitigate these risks as much as possible. My Department contributed to the process and identified the areas within its remit.  On 9 July the Government published the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update which<i></i>reflects the extensive work that has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis. The Action Plan emphasises the need for stepped up preparedness measures, by exposed businesses in particular. In that regard, approximately one third of the Irish construction industry's  inputs are imported, a significant proportion of which comes from the UK.</p><p>The preparedness measures for the construction sector span across a number of Government Department and Offices. These include the Department of Education and Skills (construction workers/professional qualifications), the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation &amp;amp; NSAI (the trade of goods and services) and the  Revenue  Commissioners (customs, duties and levies) and each is engaging on the issues in their areas. </p><p>One of the key areas under my Department's remit is the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (CPR), which sets the rules for placing certain construction products on the EU market and the requirement for a CE Marking.  On the date of withdrawal, the UK becomes a third country. This has implications for the certification of certain construction products, for manufacturers, importers, distributors and authorised representatives when placing products on the Irish/EU Market and builders, building professionals and others when specifying and using certain construction products. </p><p>Since January 2018, my  Department has been engaging with the construction sector in relation to the impact of Brexit  for the CPR and the actions that should be taken before the UK leaves the EU. In collaboration with the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and NSAI, my Department set up a working group with key stakeholders (including the Construction Industry Federation, IBEC/Building Materials Federation, Hardware Association of Ireland, Irish Concrete Federation, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland,  Engineers Ireland and others) to further raise awareness of the business continuity requirements and provide clarity where necessary.  The Department is also engaged in presenting at industry events, providing information on its website and disseminating updates to registered users of the Building Control Management System (over 100,000 users). </p><p>Issues in relation to the credit environment are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

CIRI was established on a voluntary basis in 2014 and over 850 building and contracting entities are currently included on the register. </p>  <p>  The Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The General Scheme is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/legislations/general_scheme_of_the_building_control_construction_industry_register_ireland_bill_2017.pdf.</p>  <p>  The main objective of the legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p>  <p>  It is proposed that the operation of CIRI will be vested in the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in the same way that statutory registration of Architects was vested in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), pursuant to the Building Control Act 2007. The independence and objectivity of the registration board will be critical to the success of CIRI and a number of provisions are included in the draft Bill to uphold the independence of the registration system, including in relation to fees. My Department is working with the Attorney General's Office with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in early 2020.</p></reply>
