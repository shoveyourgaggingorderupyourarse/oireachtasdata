This will form an important part of the implementation of the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2021 to 2027. </p>  <p>  I would add that here in Ireland, since November 2020, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 place an obligation on an employer where an employee, whose work involves potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, becomes infected with COVID-19 to report this to the Health and Safety Authority. </p>  <p>  This is in addition to the existing public health reporting obligations relating to COVID-19 infection. Under the Public Health Act (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, all infectious diseases are reportable to the Public Health Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting system (CIDR). COVID-19 was included in the Infectious Diseases Regulations in February 2020. </p>  <p>  There is also a second reporting system under the National Incident Management System (NIMs) which collects national data on incidents of COVID-19 in the public healthcare sector in Ireland. These reporting systems are an important source of information in identifying prevalence and trends, monitoring progress, and informing interventions.</p>  <p>  Separately, the inclusion of COVID-19 as an occupational injury under the Occupational Injuries Benefit scheme is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection under the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations, 1967 as amended.</p></reply>

There are 49 IDA client companies employing 6,838 people in this region.  FDI performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years, with employment among IDA clients increasing by 43% over that time.  This region showed 10% FDI employment growth during 2021- the highest rate of growth across the country.  IDA supported companies operate across a variety of sectors, including Life Sciences, Technology, Consumer Business Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies, in the region.</p><p>Westmeath is home to 28 companies who employ 4,099 people directly.  This month Enermech officially opened its new Irish manufacturing facility in Athlone, creating 170 jobs and involving an investment of &euro;9.2m.  In August, Ashland announced plans to double headcount and footprint at its Viatel bioresorbable polymer manufacturing and R&amp;amp;D facility in Mullingar.  Ericsson officially announced its plans in May to hire 250 additional people at its Irish R&amp;amp;D Centre in Athlone.  In March DuPont/OxyMem officially announced a multi-million-euro transformation of its OxyMem&trade; Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactor (MABR) at its manufacturing facility in Athlone.</p><p>Longford is home to 6 overseas companies employing 1,310 people. Recent announcements in Longford include Center Parcs announcing a &euro;85m expansion plan for their forest resort in Ballymahon.  250 additional jobs are planned to be created once the development is completed, and the development will create 300 construction jobs. </p><p>IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with existing clients across the Midlands to retain and strengthen their presence through continued company transformation as well as pursuing new areas of opportunity for client companies. IDA will also continue to work closely with Enterprise Ireland and its indigenous base of companies to identify synergies, enhance clusters, participate in site visits, and maximise benefits for the region. </p><p>The existing FDI base of companies in the region enjoy strong collaborative links with the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest (TUS), and the presence of a third level Institution of scale further strengthens the potential of the wider region. </p><p>The timely provision of appropriate and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of MNC&rsquo;s remains essential to winning FDI.  As part of IDA&rsquo;s  Regional Property Programme, the Agency has committed to delivering three Advanced Building Solutions in County Westmeath and one in County Longford. </p><p>The IDA will continue to actively promote Westmeath and Longford as part of the wider Midlands value proposition throughout 2022 and beyond.</p></reply>

These lists undergo periodic review, guided by relevant research and a public/stakeholder consultation.  The views of the relevant policy Departments are taken into account as well as those of the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy.  </p>  <p>  My Department chairs the Interdepartmental Group to oversee the review process which includes membership drawn from senior officials of key departments including the Department of Health. The aim of the Group is to promote an integrated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages being experienced in the economy.  This includes assessing proposals received through the public consultation for changes the Occupations Lists.</p>  <p>  Changes I announced in June last year were aimed at addressing the shortages being experienced in nursing home establishments and hospital settings by providing access to the employment permits system.  These employers can apply for the General Employment Permit for non-EEA nationals wishing to take up employment as a Nursing Auxiliary or Assistant (Health Care Assistant). The minimum annual remuneration for a Health Care Assistant is &euro;27,000 based on a 39 hour working week. </p>  <p>  Home Care Workers are not currently eligible for an employment permit.  No change was recommended to the eligibility of Home Care Workers in the review of the occupations lists conducted during 2021.</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are actively engaged with the Department of Health in relation to recruitment challenges for the care sector and my Department is a member of the Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group chaired by the Department of Health to consider the recruitment and retention challenges faced by the care sector.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to keep the employment permits system under review in light of changing labour market circumstances and the timing of the next Review of the Occupational Lists will be kept under consideration.</p></reply>

The Agreement will cement the close political and economic relations between the EU and Mercosur countries and represents a clear commitment from both regions to rules-based international trade.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Ireland exported nearly &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region. In 2020 &ndash; the most recent year for which figures are available &ndash; Ireland exported approximately &euro;1 billion worth of services to Mercosur. The independent impact assessment commissioned by my Department, and published last July, concluded that Irish exports to the Mercosur market are expected to be 17% higher in 2035 under the terms of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  However, we also have some well-known concerns regarding climate change and the environmental impact of the extensive forest fires we have seen in the Amazon. I have raised these concerns at all political levels, including through my engagement with the Commission and with Trade Minister colleagues in Council.</p>  <p>  Specifically, at a meeting of the EU&rsquo;s Trade Council in Berlin in September 2020, I took the opportunity to remind both the Commission, and my counterparts, that enforceable guarantees which strengthen environmental protections, particularly with regard to the Amazon rainforest and climate action, are a priority for this Government in terms of our assessment of the benefits of the Agreement when it is formally presented for decision. Furthermore, there was a discussion on the EU-Mercosur Agreement at the meeting of EU Trade Ministers in Brussels in May 2021 at which I restated my and our Government's position on these important issues. Following these discussions, I took the opportunity to write to EU Executive Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Dombrovskis in June 2021 to restate Ireland&rsquo;s position, as well as to address other Trade Policy matters.</p>  <p>  On the basis of these concerns, raised by Ireland and other EU Member States, the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) are engaged with the Mercosur countries on negotiating further enforceable commitments on climate and deforestation.</p>  <p>  Finally, both I and officials from my Department and across Government have continued to articulate our clear position regarding this Agreement at the highest level in the EU, including in bilateral conversations with colleague Trade Ministers in the margins of EU Council meetings.</p></reply>

These reviews are guided by relevant research and a public/stakeholder consultation. The views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are also taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  Account is taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors. Changes to the employment permit occupations lists are made where there are no suitable Irish/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, a genuine skills shortage exists, rather than a recruitment or retention problem, and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported.</p>  <p>  In October 2021, following a comprehensive review of the employment permit occupation lists and in light of the continued labour shortages in the Agriculture and Agri-Food Sector, I extended previous quotas to release 1000 general employment permits for horticulture operatives, 500 for meat deboners, 1500 for meat processing operatives and introduced a new quota of 100 for dairy farm assistants. </p>  <p>  All Agriculture quotas were opened with a proviso that a strategic review on labour attraction and retention in the sector is carried out in order to put in place more sustainable solutions for meeting the labour needs of the sector into the future.</p>  <p>  Policy responsibility for Agriculture and related industry is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to keep the employment permits system under review in light of changing labour market circumstances and the timing of the next Review of the Occupational Lists will be kept under consideration.</p></reply>

Responding to developments in international trade, combined with rising costs and geopolitical uncertainty, companies across all sectors have taken steps to increase the flexibility and resiliency of supply chains, including reworking networks and nearshoring activities. To ensure that Ireland remains competitive for FDI, IDA Ireland reviews its overall enterprise policy on an ongoing basis. In carrying out this ongoing review process IDA Ireland works to ensure the Agency is aware of all relevant emerging trends, opportunities and challenges. This includes the trend of nearshoring, which involves a business moving its operation to a nearby country from one of greater distance. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has and continues to demonstrate its focus on this trend. IDA Ireland partners with client companies to identify opportunities for local sourcing to enhance the resilience of their supply chains. In doing so, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectoral divisions consider how to strengthen value chain linkages between IDA Ireland client companies and SMEs. This activity is beneficial to both MNCs and SMEs as linkages are strengthened and positive spillovers are achieved. IDA is collaborating with Enterprise Ireland to achieve the spillover effect, directly introducing MNCs to Enterprise Ireland clients which can fulfil supply chain requirements with local sourcing. This a key component of the Impact pillar under the IDA&rsquo;s four-year strategy, &lsquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth&rsquo;, to increased spend in the Irish economy by our MNCs. The target is to see a 20% increase in client expenditure in Ireland to maximise the impact of FDI over the four years of the strategy.</p></reply>

The proposal focuses on establishing a system within company law and corporate governance to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts arising from companies' own operations, their subsidiaries' operations and their value chains. Companies are required to engage with business partners in their value chains to remedy such impacts. While the proposal includes sanctions in case of non-compliance with the due diligence obligations, it does not require Member States or companies to prohibit the placing and making available of any product on the market.</p>  <p>  Discussions on this proposal are ongoing at Council working party level and it is not anticipated that a directive will be finalised until well into 2023. </p>  <p>  A complementary proposal for a Regulation on prohibiting products made with forced labour on the Union market was published by the Commission on 14 September and negotiations at Council working party level have not yet commenced.  The aim of this new proposal is to ensure sure that products found to be produced with forced labour are banned from the EU.  Given its recent publication, consideration by my department of this proposal in advance of negotiations commencing at Council working party is at an early stage.</p>  <p>  China is Ireland's 4th largest goods import partner with such imports from China in 2021 valued at &euro;8,452 million.

It is critical to ensure that consumers receive the benefit of windfall gains in the electricity sector resulting from the war in Ukraine.    </p>  <p>  Earlier this month the European Commission published a proposal for a Council Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This proposal will assist Government in determining whether and, if so, how a windfall tax and other interventions could be introduced, having regard to the overall approach to be adopted at EU level. The monies raised from such interventions would be used to mitigate the impact of the high electricity prices on the final electricity customers. Officials from my Department continue to work with colleagues from across Government and at level EU on these issues. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the European Commission is carrying out ongoing work concerning the long-term market design as announced in it's Communication on Short-Term Energy Market Interventions and Long-Term Improvements to the Electricity Market Design that was issued alongside the Repower EU Plan of 18 May 2022. </p>  <p>  Ireland operates within the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM) and given the electricity market operates across two jurisdictions all impacts, intentional or otherwise, must be considered prior to making any changes to it. </p>  <p>The best, long-term approach for Ireland to lower energy prices is to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels, through investment in indigenous renewable energy sources which aligns with the Government's target of up to 80% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030.   </p></reply>

EU countries are closely coordinating actions to tackle these rising prices and secure our energy. I attended the Extraordinary Energy Council meeting on 9 September 2022 to exchange views on the energy situation in the EU. The meeting was split into two parts, the first sessions covering policy options to alleviate the burden of high energy prices and the second session on the state of play of the preparedness of Member States for the coming winter.</p>  <p>  In respect of the extremely high energy prices discussion, the Council covered four main areas in which the Member States expect the Commission to act. These include capping the revenues of electricity producers that face low production costs; a possible price cap on gas; measures for a coordinated electricity demand reduction across the EU and measures that would help to solve the issue of decreased liquidity.</p>  <p>  The Commission have since proposed legislation and this is already under urgent negotiation by Member States in order to have agreement by the end of the month. We are supportive of the overall approach being taken by the Commission and will cooperate closely with other Member States to get the Regulation agreed swiftly. </p>  <p>The Council also covered Member States preparedness for this winter. Member States have carried out several actions both at national and EU level. They have in particular adopted a regulation to fill gas storages and share them in a spirit of solidarity, diversified supply sources and committed to reducing gas demand by 15% this winter. EU underground gas reserves have been filled to 82.5% of their capacity, well ahead of the 1 November deadline set in the gas storage regulation.    </p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, including the matters raised by the Deputy, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister.In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014.

This is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious retrofitting programmes in Europe.</p><p>The measures address barriers to undertaking energy upgrades (retrofits) reported by homeowners and those working in the industry. They also reflect the step-change needed &ndash; in pace and scale of delivery &ndash; to achieve our target of 500,000 home energy upgrades, to B2 Building Energy Rating (BER) standard, by 2030. The changes represent an important step in delivery of the National Retrofit Plan, which identifies a range of measures aimed at driving demand for retrofit, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain, as well as making retrofits more affordable.</p><p>The enhanced package of measures to support the uptake of home energy upgrades include:</p><p>- A new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard.</p><p>- Establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing, for home energy upgrades.</p><p>- A significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades provided to those at risk of energy poverty alongside changes to the operation of the Warmer Homes Scheme. This includes ensuring the Scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the Scheme for homeowner &lsquo;revisits&rsquo; thereby allowing them apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme.</p><p>- A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households. This will help to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices. </p><p>The investment this year targets almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a BER of B2. </p><p>Figures provided by the SEAI show that to the end of August 13,406 homes have been completed across the residential energy efficiency schemes (up 70% compared to the same period last year) and of these, 4,234 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better (up almost 140% compared to the same period last year). </p><p>The number of free upgrades provided under the Warmer Homes Scheme each month has more than doubled versus last year. As of the end of August, 2,642 homes have been completed under the Warmer Homes Scheme, and of these 86 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better. </p><p>In addition, since the announcements in February, demand across the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high with a very significant increase in the number of applications year to date when compared to the same period in 2021. Over 30,000 applications for grant support have been received by the SEAI &ndash; a 140% increase on the same period last year and this strong pipeline of projects is translating into delivery for the remainder of this year and into 2023.</p><p>In relation to heat pumps, across all schemes the number of installations for the years in question are as follows: this year to the end of August: 1,049 and for the years 2019, 2020 &amp;amp; 2021: 1,200, 1,640 and 2,010 respectively.</p><p>To accelerate delivery in a number of key areas I am establishing a number of cross government/agency delivery taskforces, to accelerate and drive delivery in key programme areas, one of which, as outlined in the National Energy Security Framework, will focus on the heat sector and built environment. The Heat and Built Environment Delivery Taskforce&rsquo;s draft Terms of Reference, membership and work programme are currently being finalised, with a view to a meeting of the Taskforce taking place in October 2022.</p><p>The aim of the Heat and Built Environment Taskforce will be to accelerate and drive delivery with a focus on:</p><p>-Retrofitting; </p><p>-Renewable Heat; </p><p>-District Heating; and,</p><p>-Decarbonisation of Ireland&rsquo;s building stock.</p><p>It is envisaged that the Taskforce will identify all aspects of work on the critical path to accelerate and drive delivery, to ensure alignment in the development of polices and activities underway across Government Departments and to proactively manage risks to ensure targets are achieved. My Department also engages with relevant Government Departments on an ongoing basis in relation to implementation of the National Retrofit Plan.</p></reply>

The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is one of the major Government policies to help deliver on this.  </p>  <p>  RESS 1 is expected to deliver 1,022MW of new renewable generation, 569MW of solar and 453MW of wind, an approximate 15% increase in Ireland&rsquo;s current renewable energy generation capacity by the end of 2023.To date, 11 projects equalling 353MW of new renewable generation have already connected to the grid under RESS 1, meaning renewable energy capacity connected to the grid in Ireland is now above 5GW.</p>  <p>  The second RESS auction (RESS 2) was held this year and is expected to deliver an increase of nearly 20% in Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy generation.80 projects were initially successful in RESS 2 and the competition is expected to lead to 300 MW of wind and almost 1,500 MW of solar connected in 2024/25, with additional corporate power purchase agreements likely to support the development of further wind and solar generation.</p>  <p>  Design of the RESS 3 auction is also currently under development to further contribute to the up to 80% target. My Department is also finalising the Terms and Conditions on the first of three planned auctions this decade for the Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS). A roadmap of future auctions which sets out the indicative timelines and volumes for onshore and offshore auctions over the coming decade was published in December 2021.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 also commits to achieving at least 5GW of offshore wind by 2030. The Government has recently agreed to increase our ambition in offshore wind energy, moving from 5GW to 7GW, with the additional 2GW earmarked for the supply of green hydrogen, a strategy for which is under development.</p>  <p>Achieving climate targets through accelerating deployment of renewable energy sources will entail investment of tens of billions of euro, including in the installation and maintenance of generation assets, and associated infrastructure and services, as well as in the development of supply chains and port infrastructure.  </p></reply>

In this context, earlier this month, the European Union North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), which is currently co-chaired by Ireland, agreed a non-binding target of 260GW by 2050 for the EU's North Seas, with non-binding targets of 15-20GW by 2040 and 37GW by 2050 for Ireland. The Government has recently agreed to target the delivery of an additional 2GW of offshore wind dedicated to the production of green hydrogen. This is in addition to the existing 2030 target of 5GW of offshore wind energy from 5GW, as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021, being developed to achieve our goal of up to 80% of electricity coming from renewable sources by 2030. </p>  <p>  The early phases of the offshore energy development will be primarily located off our eastern and southern coasts reflecting the suitably shallower waters in these regions for deployment of fixed bottom wind turbines, the availability of electricity grid infrastructure capacity, and proximity to the largest demand centres. It is envisaged that advances in floating turbine technology will aid the cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast.</p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 (enacted in December 2021) provides a legislative basis to harness the potential of offshore renewable energy outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone provided for in the Foreshore Act (1933), while protecting our rich and unique marine environment. A consultation will shortly conclude on how the second batch of Offshore Renewable Energy projects (Phase Two) will be selected to enter the new consenting system. This includes a proposal to allow for an Innovation Category which may be of specific interest to developers of floating offshore wind energy designs.</p>  <p>  A new Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) will be published in early 2023. The OREDP II will assess Ireland&rsquo;s offshore energy resource potential, including for floating wind off the west coast.

Maintaining security of supply while integrating greater levels of renewable generation will require a very high penetration of variable electricity on the Irish grid, with increased electricity storage capacity providing a low-carbon substitute for high greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  EirGrid has reported that a number of battery storage projects have been contracted via two mechanisms: SEM Capacity Auctions and DS3 Systems Services. There is currently approximately 500MW of short-duration batteries on the all-island system providing system services, as well as 292MW of pumped hydro storage. In order to further support energy storage development throughout Ireland, my Department has committed to develop an energy storage policy framework which is due for publication early next year. To help inform the development of this framework a public consultation will issue shortly. </p>  <p>  Hydrogen storage could also have a significant role to play in power generation as a form of long-term electricity storage, with hydrogen potentially being used as a backup to renewables to generate electricity during periods of low renewable availability. In July, my Department launched a public consultation to gather the views of stakeholders to inform the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland which will be published later this year. Among the issues addressed was the question of hydrogen storage and responses were invited on a range of questions as to how Ireland might best develop hydrogen storage capacity. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently undertaking a review of the security of supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. This review includes the identification of potential options to mitigate risks to security of supply, including different forms of energy storage. As part of this review, my Department recently launched a consultation to seek views from interested parties.</p>  <p>  Finally, over the course of the next decade all energy users across Ireland will be invited to adopt new approaches to using and conserving energy, including changing how they generate, store and consume electricity. One example of this is ESB Network&rsquo;s National Network, Local Connections programme which will be critical in creating a dynamic energy system and will explore the role of storage, among other flexibility drivers, in optimising the system for consumers across Ireland. </p></reply>

Therefore, of the specific bodies referred to in Question No. 90 of 24 May 2022, Ervia, the ESB, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath-Dublin Bus and Coillte Teoranta are not public bodies, and consequently not &lsquo;relevant bodies&rsquo; for the purposes of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. However, the recently approved Climate Action Framework for the Commercial Semi-State Sector (www.gov.ie/en/press-release/bd704-government-approves-climate-action-framework-for-the-commercial-semi-state-sector/) provides an opportunity for commercial semi-states to demonstrate their commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s climate goals. This Framework comprises a series of commitments for all semi-state companies to deliver on climate action, and it will support and encourage all semi-state companies to play a lead role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a carbon neutral economy and society.</p></reply>

The review examines measures Ireland can take to mitigate potential risks including additional capacity to import energy, energy storage, fuel diversification and renewable gases.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 also recognises the important role of electricity storage in supporting the transformation of the electricity sector. Under Climate Action Plan 2021, my Department has committed to developing a national electricity storage policy framework, which is due for publication next year. To help inform this work, a public consultation will be launched in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  At present, Turlough Hill is the only large-scale pumped storage power station in Ireland with an installed capacity of 292MW. However, Ireland has also supported the inclusion of the Silvermines Hydroelectric Pumped Storage facility on the EU&rsquo;s Project of Common Interest List, which includes key cross border infrastructure projects that link the energy systems of EU countries but can also include large-scale storage projects. The proposed Silvermines pumped-hydro storage facility is currently EU Project of Common Interest (PCI) 2.29, having been selected for the 5th PCI List in 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government considers that the Silvermines pumped hydro project has the potential to make an important contribution to power generation decarbonisation and security of supply on the island of Ireland.

The credit of &euro;176.22 (excluding VAT) has been applied to all domestic electricity accounts through April, May and June, including prepay meters.</p>  <p>  The scheme operated by the Distribution System Operator (ESB Networks) and electricity suppliers with oversight by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities used the single eligibility criterion of an electricity meter point registration number (MPRN), to ensure payments to each domestic electricity account, without any additional means testing. </p>  <p>  The payment was applied to domestic electricity accounts i.e. those which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2), as set out in section 1 of the Act. This included pay as you go / prepay customers.</p>  <p>  The majority of prepayment meters accepted the credit in one go. However, I understand that there was a small population of older prepayment meters which, due to their age and inbuilt monetary limits, required the customer to redeem their credit through three separate transactions over the space of a few days.</p>  <p>  In these cases, to redeem each stage of the credit, customers needed to buy a (minimum) &euro;10 top up. When they did this they then received a new 40-digit code which credited their meter with the government electricity credit when entered. Once the credit was applied to the customer&rsquo;s account/meter they accessed it by vending three times.Each supplier was allocated funding for each MPRN to which they were supplying electricity on 29 March 2022. </p>  <p>  As such, customers who have not received the credit to their MPRN should contact the supplier they were with on this date in the first instance, as noted in the scheme&rsquo;s Frequently Asked Questions which are available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/4ae14-electricity-costs-emergency-benefit-scheme/.</p></reply>

This indicates that the demand for the scheme, as it is currently designed, is very high. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff is now available to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity that they may export to the grid, reflective of the market value; which further supports the investment.     </p>  <p>    Solar PV is also one of a range of measures funded under the SEAI Communities Energy Grant Scheme which makes grant funding available to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock and is open to domestic and non-domestic applications.    </p>  <p>  Included in measures targeted at consumers under the National Energy Security Framework (NESF) announced by Government is a fully funded &euro;20m scheme for medically vulnerable people with high electricity usage to install rooftop solar PV. The SEAI is currently working with key stakeholders and I expect publication of the details on the SEAI website in near future. </p>  <p>  Finally, my Department is also engaging with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to develop a new Low-Cost Residential Retrofit Loan Scheme.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p>  <p>  The Young Adult Card (YAC) was initially introduced on PSO services in May. Following extensive engagement between my Department, the NTA, and representatives from the commercial bus sector the initiative was broadened to include participating Commercial Bus Operators (CBOs) on the 4th of September. As a result, holders of a YAC or Student Leap Card can now avail of the 50% fare discount on both PSO and CBO services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question on the eligibility requirements for the YAC, I am happy to clarify that the NTA are widening the age rules of the Scheme to allow 16, 17, and 18-year-old students in third level education to apply for the Student Leap Card so that they can also avail of the discount. This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA have already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a Student Leap Card and avail of the discount.  </p></reply>

In recognition of this, the Climate Action Plan contains commitments to significantly increase electrification within the national fleet, including an ambitious target of 945,000 electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Meeting this target will be extremely challenging; however, it represents the scale of transformation needed in the transport sector if emissions are to be reduced to the extent required. </p><p>A positive policy environment has been fostered with a generous suite of financial and taxation incentives in place for those buying an EV as well as an extensive publicly accessible recharging infrastructure network. Presently, there are approximately 64,700 EVs on Irish roads; a significant step-up is required if Ireland is to achieve its Climate Action Plan EV target. </p><p>My Department established the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Working Group to consider the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies available to Government to significantly accelerate electric vehicle sales. This Group focused on mechanisms to achieve an immediate increase in EV uptake to attain over 175,000 EVs by 2025 in the line with the Climate Action Plan trajectory and, thereafter, to be well placed to reach full electrification by 2030. In its report, published last year, the Group recommended that proposals be developed to support EV sales in the commercial fleet,  including but not limited to car rental/leasing companies, company  vehicles and car sharing services, in order to stimulate a greater  second-hand EV market.</p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles. Further information on Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland and the various incentives is available at  www.gov.ie/zevi.</p><p>At a policy level, ZEVI will continue to support the need to assist the transition to driving electric. I am supportive of all appropriate and proportionate supports for the EV industry providing momentum towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s emission reduction commitment. I will ask ZEVI to consider the effectiveness of introducing such a scheme.  <b></b></p></reply>

As such, the NTA has powers to make regulations in relation to the age limits of SPSVs.</p><p>Regulations made by the NTA in 2010 first established an age limit of less than 10 years old for new standard taxis and hackneys.

This change helped ensure no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.</p><p>Within the last month a series of global circumstances has, in the NTA&rsquo;s view, considerably worsened the capability of taxi and hackney licence holders to secure new vehicles, with lead times of one year not uncommon already. Therefore the NTA have recently proposed to temporarily extend the maximum permissible age for taxis and hackneys with a current final operation date in 2023 and 2024, such that no current vehicle licence holder is forced out of the industry because a replacement vehicle cannot be purchased.</p><p>The NTA have opened a public consultation on this proposal on 19 September 2022, and will run until 12 October 2022. Details and submission forms are available on the NTA website.</p><p>At the same time, there continue to be supports available to drivers who wish to change their vehicles.</p><p>These supports include:</p><p>-  The eSPSV Grant Scheme to which I allocated &euro;15m toward this year alone and which supports drivers in their transition to zero / low emission vehicles. </p><p>-  The eSPSV Business Loan provided by Microfinance Ireland to support those SPSV owners accessing the eSPSV Grant Scheme but who are unable to secure finance from financial institutions. </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling and timetabling of these services in conjunction with the relevant transport operators.</p>  <p>  The performance of all public transport operators is monitored by the  NTA as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. These contractual arrangements allow for not just the monitoring of performance by the NTA and the publication by it of annual performance reports, but importantly, the contracts also allow for the imposition of financial penalties where performance does not meet the required standard.</p>  <p>  It is the case that operators in the public transport sector are experiencing difficulties with staffing both as a result of COVID-19 related absences and also difficulties in recruiting new drivers; however, it is also the case that Go-Ahead Ireland is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences at present resulting in a knock-on effect on service delivery with some services not operating as scheduled. In addition, last week the company notified the NTA of a cyber-security alert which resulted in major difficulties in communicating rosters to drivers across the Go-Ahead group internationally, including Ireland, causing a number of additional service cancellations across the Go-Ahead Ireland network, over and above those associated with general driver shortages.</p>  <p>  As part of the NTA&rsquo;s performance monitoring system poor reliability and punctuality performance does result in financial penalties. I am informed that these matters will be discussed between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland at their forthcoming quarterly review meeting.</p>  <p>  The NTA formally meets Go-Ahead Ireland on a weekly basis to review performance, associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans and will continue to monitor and engage closely with the operator in an effort to improve the situation.</p>  <p>  Operators are forecasting significant improvements in reliability in the coming months, dependent on successful recruitment and retention of critical staff, in particular drivers, and it is hoped that this will help to resolve to current reliability issues being experienced.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p>  <p>  The Young Adult Card (YAC) was initially introduced on PSO services in May. Following extensive engagement between my Department, the NTA, and representatives from the commercial bus sector the initiative was broadened to include participating Commercial Bus Operators (CBOs) on the 4th of September. As a result, holders of a YAC or Student Leap Card can now avail of the 50% fare discount on both PSO and CBO services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question on the eligibility requirements for the YAC, I am happy to clarify that the NTA are widening the age rules of the Scheme to allow 16, 17, and 18-year-old students in third level education to apply for the Student Leap Card so that they can also avail of the discount. This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA have already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a Student Leap Card and avail of the discount.</p></reply>

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post 2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country.  The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments.</p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework.</p>  <p>  The revised Public Spending Code requires a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more. The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.

Government noted, inter alia, the intention of the Group to explore the potential to transfer the business of key heritage sites, where appropriate, to the relevant local authority, which was considered the most achievable option to secure the future of the heritage assets and employees.</p>  <p>  The Shannon Airport Group has had extensive engagement with the relevant local authorities since early last year. Shannon Heritage ended their management contracts with An Post and Fingal County Council for sites in Dublin on 31 December 2021 and the transfer of the business and employees took place without issue. King John&rsquo;s Castle was successfully transferred to Limerick City and County Council on 4 April.  I would like to acknowledge the extensive preparation and cooperation between the Group and Fingal County Council, Limerick County Council and An Post for the smooth transfer of these sites. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that the Shannon Airport Group continues to engage with Clare County Council in relation to the proposed transfer of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, Craggaunowen, Knappogue Castle, and Cliffs of Moher Retail Outlet.</p>  <p>  The Department is engaging regularly with both parties with a view to progressing the transfer preparations. As part of its engagement with the Shannon Airport Group, Clare County Council identified a funding gap for which it sought government assistance to enable it to take over the sites. In response to this, in May of this year, my Department established an inter-departmental working group to consider the funding options. The group included the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the OPW, and the Department of Tourism Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.</p>  <p>  To date, the working group has met three times, and identified a number of ways to support a transfer. My Department has also met with Clare County Council and the Shannon Airport Group and has asked both to continue their engagement and consider the package of measures identified by the inter-departmental working group, with a view to reaching agreement on a transfer.</p>  <p>  Once the remaining issues around the transfer are resolved, the Shannon Airport Group will be in a position to seek the formal consent of the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to execute the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and the relevant heritage sites and this will be done with the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government recognises the importance of these heritage sites to the mid-west region, and will continue to support the Shannon Airport Group to ensure that the transfer of the Shannon Heritage business and heritage sites will proceed as planned with a view to ensuring the long-term viability and success of the business.</p></reply>

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. </p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Veterinary Nurses have an existing FRE valued at &euro;400 where the individual supplies and launders their work uniforms and &euro;150 where the work uniforms are supplied by their employer and the individual incurs only laundry costs. This current FRE for veterinary nurses does not incorporate the yearly statutory registration fee with The Veterinary Council of Ireland. </p>  <p>  In recent years Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the administratively based FRE regime which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day. Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, which as stated above, provides that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.   </p>  <p>  I understand that, on foot of the comprehensive review carried out of the FRE rates, Revenue advised the representative body for veterinary nurses that, in their case, it is intended that the statutory registration fee will be included as part of an updated FRE rate when implemented.  Revenue advises me that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  </p>  <p>  Pending the implementation of the revised FRE rates, as for all employees, veterinary nurses retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer or not already included in the relevant FRE amount. </p>  <p>  The quickest and easiest way to claim tax relief for qualifying employment expenses (including any FRE) is to complete an online Income Tax Return. This return can be found in the PAYE Services tab in myAccount on the Revenue website. </p>  <p>  Detailed guidance on membership fees paid to a professional body is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website:</p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-18.pdf.</p>  <p>  Further guidance on the general rule of deduction of expenses in employment is also available on Revenue&rsquo;s website: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-20.pdf.</p></reply>

This may include documents from a Government source, such as a passport or driving licence and institutions often use such documents to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity.</p>  <p>  However, neither the relevant legislation (the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended), nor the Central Bank of Ireland are prescriptive as to what documents and information can be relied upon. Therefore institutions have some flexibility in regard to the forms of identification documentation they may choose to rely upon and request from customers. Credit and financial institutions must take a risk-based approach when applying anti-money laundering rules and therefore it is likely that some institutions will require more - and specific - types of customer identification, than others in the sector. Accordingly these may include, but are not limited to, Government-issued photographic identification such as driving licences and passports.</p>  <p>  My officials have contacted the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and are advised that the BPFI is aware of the issues arising from the upcoming departure from the State, of Ulster Bank and KBC. BPFI advised that institutions risk-assess customers on a case-by-case basis, including those customers switching bank accounts from Ulster Bank and KBC. BPFI also advised that it is currently drafting guidance for its members in relation to this matter. </p>  <p>  Full lists of accepted proof of identity and address documents and information on how to open a bank account can be found on each of the retail banks' websites. Anyone who is unsure of how to meet the identification requirements should inquire with the bank of his/her/their choice on what would be acceptable.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has developed advice for consumers switching their current accounts, available on its website at www.ccpc.ie/move.</p></reply>

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). </p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to postpone its introduction. </p></reply>

In a more benign set of circumstances for farm enterprises, a clear recommendation to remove section 664A, perhaps on a phased basis over a number of years, might be appropriate. The fact that the normal business deduction in respect of input costs would remain in place as well as the VAT refund scheme for business diesel expenditure should also be kept in mind.</p>  <p>  However, the war in Ukraine has caused fuel prices to increase and has raised concerns domestically about food security and the supply of fodder. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has tasked a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. Against this background, the 2022/2023 autumn-winter period would not seem to be the appropriate time to make a change. It may be preferable to consider signalling a policy change in the current year but to defer action until a later date.</p>  <p>  At the same time, a move to extend the scope of section 664A beyond the current cohort of beneficiaries might be seen to undermine the desired objective of putting in place a policy approach which is more aligned across different goals. If it is considered that farm contractors require support, this might best be addressed in the context of a longer-term policy for agriculture."</p>  <p>  The position is that I have not made any change, either to extend or curtail the so called double deduction for farm diesel, in today's Budget. </p></reply>

The Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) scheme for Energy Efficient Equipment (EEE) is provided for in Section 285A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The ACA scheme for EEE allows taxpayers to deduct the full cost of expenditure on eligible equipment from taxable profits in the year of purchase. This differs from the standard treatment applicable to capital assets, whereby wear and tear is taken into account as a deduction for tax purposes at a rate of 12.5% annually, over eight years.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a tax incentive for companies and sole-traders to invest in highly EEE, to improve the overall energy efficiency of Irish companies and sole-traders, and to aid Ireland in meeting our national and EU targets on energy savings and the reduction of carbon emissions.</p>  <p>  In order for equipment to qualify for the scheme it must meet detailed energy efficiency criteria as set by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Products which meet these criteria are listed on the SEAI&rsquo;s Triple E Register which provides a benchmark register of best in class energy efficient products. There are approximately 30,000 eligible products on the SEAI&rsquo;s Triple E Register across 10 classes of technology.</p>  <p>  ACA on EEE is claimed through the normal self-assessment provisions, there is no requirement to obtain prior approval for capital expenditure on the equipment. The allowance should be claimed on the person&rsquo;s return of income, the Form CT1 for a company or Form 11 for an unincorporated business (sole-trader or member of a partnership). Both the CT1 and Form 11 include a separate line for claims made under section 285A, allowing claimants to separately claim wear and tear allowances for other plant and machinery.</p>  <p>  To establish whether equipment qualifies for the ACA scheme for EEE, taxpayers can search for the equipment on the Triple E Products Register on the SEAI website at the link below: triplee.seai.ie/AcaProducts/Search.aspx.</p></reply>

As a consequence, lower rates of tax will generally apply to cars that are more environmentally friendly.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2023 the amount taxable as a benefit-in-kind remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, but new CO2 emissions bands will be used to determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate applies. Thus, under the new charging regime, the carbon footprint and fuel emissions of the car play a key role in determining the benefit-in-kind charge.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific circumstances of the person referred to in the details supplied, a 6% BIK rate under the current rules would suggest that the person concerned does mileage in excess of 48,000 per annum.  The person also indicates that under the new rules, for the 2023 tax year and subsequent years, they will be liable to BIK at a rate of 18%.  This suggests they are driving a non-electric car in category C (i.e. CO2 Emissions more than 99g/km up to and including 139g/km) with business mileage of between 39,001 to 52,000. </p>  <p>  The precise arrangements surrounding what types of vehicles are provided by employers for those employees that are &lsquo;on the road&rsquo; in the performance of their duties is a matter between the employee and their employer.  Given the new taxation rules that will apply for company cars from 1 January next, it may provide an opportunity for the person concerned to discuss the matter with their employer.  </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-27a.374.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092700076#WRG00800"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that recent Government policy has focused on strengthening the environmental rationale behind company car taxation. Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). </p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to review it. </p></reply>

As a matter of clarification, questions of employment versus self-employment status impact the work of three different Government bodies.  The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has responsibility for the PRSI system and determines employment status for social insurance purposes; the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) determines employment status when adjudicating on employment rights matters; and Revenue may determine a worker&rsquo;s employment status in the context of his/her treatment for income tax purposes and in allocating the income earned to the appropriate Schedule under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p>  <p>  While in most situations involving determinations of employment status there is commonality of approach across the three bodies, the decision of one organisation is not binding on the other, and as a consequence, a determination of employment status in one context may not be the same as in another context.  </p>  <p>  There are close working relationships between the three bodies, including conducting joint compliance interventions to ensure that employers are operating employment arrangements correctly.  Furthermore, in July 2021, an interdepartmental working group comprising the DSP, Revenue and the WRC further updated the Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status. The purpose of the revised Code is to provide an enhanced understanding of employment status, taking into account current labour market practices and developments in legislation and case law. These developments include, for example, new forms of work such as platform work and the gig economy. It is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo;, which will continue to be updated to reflect relevant changes into the future.</p>  <p>  Instances where determinations of employment status between Revenue and the DSP (and/or the WRC) differ are very rare and there is open dialogue between the relevant bodies to discuss the respective views.  However, as already stated, the decision of one organisation is not binding on the others. </p>  <p>  One example where the approach between DSP and Revenue is different involves home tutors.  The Department of Education has an administrative agreement with Revenue that while home tutors are subject to class S PRSI (self-employed for DSP purposes), income tax and PRSI are deducted under the PAYE system (the Revenue treatment for employees) and the tutor must file an income return only if they are in receipt of other income.  </p>  <p>  Given how fine the dividing lines can be between employment and self-employment, it is a testament to the good working relations between the three Government bodies involved that there is, by and large, a common view on employment status issues.</p></reply>

Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. Budget 2023 will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices. </p>  <p>  The Government supported households and firms through the pandemic and will continue to do so in the face of unprecedented energy price spikes caused by Putin&rsquo;s war. However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are a number of administrative and legislative provisions under which employers can support employees in working from home.</p>  <p>  Employees may incur certain expenditure in the performance of their duties working from home, such as additional heating, electricity, and broadband costs. Revenue operates a long-standing administrative practice which allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 to employees, for each day worked from home, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC. There is no legal obligation on an employer to make such a payment, as it is at the discretion of the employer.</p>  <p>  The home-working allowance originated in 1993; according to the CSO's CPI Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Ireland since January 1993 is 81 per cent which, if applied to the &euro;3.20 rate, would amount to &euro;5.79 today.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working as part of the 2021 Tax Strategy Group process and published the resultant paper on the Department's website. The review found that the daily tax-free rate of &euro;3.20, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum compares favourably internationally. For example, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum.</p>  <p>  Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to a remote worker, or that amount doesn&rsquo;t sufficiently cover the additional cost borne by the employee as a result of working from home, the employee may be entitled to claim Remote Working Relief, which is provided for in section 114A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. This measure allows employees, subject to satisfying certain conditions, to claim an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the relevant cost of electricity, heating and broadband for the days spent working from home as a remote worker. </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a benefit-In-kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. In addition, the provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental. These exemptions are provided for in section 118 TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  Finally, comprehensive guidance material on the range of measures available to remote workers is published on the Revenue website. Detailed material is included in Tax and Duty Manual Part 05-02-13 Remote Working Relief, which is available at: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.</p>  <p>  The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months and stood at 6.2 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has taken significant action. Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. Budget 2023 will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices. </p>  <p>  The Government supported households and firms through the pandemic and will continue to do so in the face of unprecedented energy price spikes caused by Putin&rsquo;s war. However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system. </p></reply>

Government acknowledges the vital role that community pharmacy will play in the development and implementation of future healthcare reform, especially in regard to the aims and vision of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  The Submission referred to in your question has been considered in the context of wider health priorities during budget discussions. Notwithstanding this however, certain other matters raised have been previously drawn to the attention of the Government and work is ongoing on examining particular issues. </p>  <p>  I understand that currently there are reports of a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, has been liaising with stakeholders, on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address this issue. I am informed that this is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.  I also understand that the PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23 to assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland. The PSI has also committed in its Service Plan 2022 to complete a review of the Third Country Qualification Route (TCQR).</p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures in the context of pharmacy services and the contribution this sector could make. The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. </p>  <p>  The Government was delighted to announce the commencement of the free contraception scheme for women aged 17&ndash;25, which is a big milestone in the delivery of our commitments, under the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022 &ndash; 2023 to improve all areas of women&rsquo;s healthcare. Pharmacies who sign up to provide services under the scheme, are now further empowered to support women&rsquo;s health with the provision of prescription contraception free to 17&ndash;25-year-olds.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health will engage as necessary with government colleagues in addressing relevant issues as they arise.</p></reply>

Departments would have specifically requested candidates from this panel as the role had some Irish Language requirement.  </p>  <p>A general HEO competition - DPER Circular 08/2022 - Interdepartmental Competition for Promotion to Higher Executive Officer (HEO) in the Civil Service was published on 3 March 2022.</p>  <p>  It included a reference to vacancies arising which require staff to provide a full range of services through the Irish language (Functional Bilinguals), which may be filled from this competition. In this regard individuals who have proficiency in the Irish language may indicate their interest on the application form. </p>  <p>  The candidates from this competition would only be used for Irish roles if there were no dedicated competition in place or if the roles could not be filled from an Irish Competition.  To date 63 candidates have been assigned from this panel and none of these candidates selected the option to be considered for Irish roles.  </p>  <p>  The Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted on 22 December last.

My Department is represented on this Committee at Principal Officer level and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is similarly represented at the Committee. The committee is chaired by the Director of Irish at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. </p>  <p>  The functions of this Committee are set out in the Act and include, as mentioned above, the preparation of a National Plan, within two years of its establishment, to increase the provision of services through the medium of Irish as well periodic surveying of the number of Irish speakers employed by the public service. </p></reply>

One of the key inputs to the report is a review and report on examples of systems used in other jurisdictions for the allocation of Lottery funding. </p>  <p>  I believe that work on finalising and submitting the report is close to completion and I understand that the report will be available for my consideration in the near future.

The scheme is administered by the Office of Public Works (OPW).</p>  <p>  To be eligible for assistance under this once-off Scheme, a homeowner had to meet a number of conditions, including that floodwater entered and damaged the building during or as a result of flooding during relevant dates such as to render it uninhabitable and that there is no viable engineering solution that could protect the property from future flooding.</p>  <p>  Remedial Works is a unique and once-off scheme that has been designed as part of the Voluntary Home Relocation Scheme. These works are identified engineering solutions to be implemented by the relevant local authority that would protect properties that would otherwise be eligible for relocation and for which there is no other funding source. The OPW can provide initial funding to the local authority to carry out preliminary assessments and reports to inform the viability of any engineering solution. If an engineering solution will provide the required level of protection to a property from future flooding of the same magnitude as that experienced in the Winter of 2015/16 and is considered value for money in the context of the cost of relocation, the OPW can provide the local authority with the funding necessary to implement the works.</p>  <p>  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the Council applied to the OPW for funding for the Council to commission a report that would inform any potential engineering solution for the property concerned. This was approved. The Council has received the report and has been considering its contents. A meeting between the OPW and the Council is due to be held shortly to consider the matter, and the property owner will be contacted shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The Arts Council sees festivals as key producers and presenters of the arts and are critical to engaging large and diverse audiences. The Arts Council also provides financial support to a number of single art form festivals (e.g. theatre, dance, film) and such festivals are supported within the policy context of those art forms. The Council also supports many multidisciplinary arts festivals, meaning those festivals that programme across different art forms, including literature, music, street arts, theatre, visual arts and different areas of arts practice. Their Festivals Investment Scheme, for example, is specifically designed to offer support to local/voluntary organisations to develop arts festivals. The larger festivals regularly supported by the Council include the Wexford Festival Opera and the Galway Arts Festival. Further details can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website at the following link www.artscouncil.ie/Arts-in-Ireland/Festivals/</p>  <p>  My Department run a Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools Scheme. The Scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central Government monies, and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. The maximum funding available under this scheme is capped at &euro;5,000.  Details of the 34 events that were supported under the Small Scale Local Festivals and Summer Schools taking place around Ireland in 2022  can be found via this link  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/247c6-minister-martin-announces-funding-for-small-scale-local-festivals-and-summer-schools/</p>  <p>  The Department also provides funding to support Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;), which is the largest group involved in the preservation and promotion of Irish traditional music both at community and national level. Annual funding is provided to CC&Eacute; for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.  Many of us welcomed the return of the Fleadh Cheoil that  took place in Mullingar from 31 July to 7 August. As the greatest annual gathering under the auspices of Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, the Fleadh is principally organised at community level by the local branches in partnership with the local authority, media and other partners and sponsors. </p>  <p>  The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department to promote individual, community and national well-being. Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal well-being and achievement. Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022. These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community.  Within this context, many festivals and events have received support from their local authorities. Further information is available on www.creatieireland.gov.ie/en/creative-communities/</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland supports local authorities in the development of tourism in their area including funding for capital investment, festivals and events. Festivals and participative events are also an important part of Irish tourism activities and in this context, F&aacute;ilte Ireland operate the Festival Innovation Programme Fund, which can be found at this link: www.failteireland.ie/Identify-Available-Funding/Festivals-Innovation-Programme.aspx</p>  <p>  Festivals and events also play a significant part in attracting and holding visitors in particular areas of Ireland at different times of the year. Tourism Ireland works closely with many festivals to provide exposure for them in key markets overseas. The St Patrick&rsquo;s Festival, Galway 2020, Cork Jazz Festival, and Wexford Festival Opera are just some examples of festivals which have received extensive coverage through Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing overseas. Tourism Ireland also work with Culture Ireland to bring the best of Ireland&rsquo;s artists, writers, poets, musicians and dancers to the attention of enthusiasts and new audiences.</p></reply>

My intention, as I have made clear on a number of occasions, is that I would like to provide for an individual complaints mechanism if it were feasible to do so.</p>  <p>  On 20 September, I brought the report of the Expert Group to Government and subsequently published it. The report backed the feasibility of an individual complaints mechanism subject to some important considerations and recommended that provision be made in the OSMR Bill for a phased roll-out of the mechanism, initially prioritising those complaints about online content relating to children.</p>  <p>  The report identifies various dependencies upon which the effectiveness, feasibility and success of an individual complaints mechanism will hinge, including that the individual complaints mechanism will not have its full or intended effect unless and until effective systemic regulation of complaints handling process, through Online Safety Codes made by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, has become well established. </p>  <p>  Amendments to the OSMR Bill are currently being drafted to provide for the recommendations of the Expert Group. Following this legislative drafting process, it is my intention to seek Government approval to table the amendments at D&aacute;il Committee Stage. </p>  <p>  Second stage of the OSMR Bill was completed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 22 September and it is my intention to progress the Bill through the remaining stages of the legislative process and ensure enactment as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties, which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy to towns of all sizes around the country and new accommodation to both urban and rural areas. We want to see vacant homes, and indeed vacant commercial properties that could be converted, brought back into use and we are incentivising people to do that through the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe Towns Fund.</p>  <p>  Schemes under the Fund, which is delivered by local authorities, will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties and by providing serviced sites in towns and villages to people in order to build their own homes.</p>  <p>  On the 14 July, I launched the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund. The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence.</p>  <p>  A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.</p>  <p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.  Under the Ready to Build Scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers to build their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on the market value of the site for the building of a property for occupation as the principal private residence of the purchaser. </p>  <p>  When the Fund was launched, I committed to ongoing review of the schemes under it and in particular I am pleased to see that the feedback on the Vacant Property Refurbishment Scheme to date has been overwhelmingly positive, with 169 applications submitted by the start of September.</p>  <p>  Given that Pathway 4 of Housing for All is intended to support re-use of existing buildings and the synergy with the Government's Our Rural Future policy, I do see the sense in extending the eligibility for the scheme to vacant properties in both our cities and rural areas to ensure we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible. In that context, I am pleased to say that the Government has decided to extend the vacant property refurbishment scheme and I expect to have that extension to cities and rural properties in place by the end of October.</p>  <p>  It will continue to be only for those who intend to occupy the property as their principal private residence. Officials in my Department will work with the Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority in the coming weeks to update the details of the Grant, with a view to the expanded scheme being available by the end of October.</p>  <p>  Vacant Homes Officers in each local authority will be available to provide advice and information on the schemes and the application process. </p></reply>

The volume of applications made under the Act in recent years has grown significantly. In parallel, my Department is leading an extensive marine management reform programme, the likes of which the State has never seen.</p>  <p>  The expected time for processing and determining foreshore applications can vary considerably and is influenced by the quality of the application and supporting documents received, the nature and complexity of the application, the level of public engagement during the consultation process and up until recently, impacts from restrictions imposed as a result of Covid-19, among other matters. Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. </p>  <p>  A range of foreshore consents related to offshore energy infrastructure granted under the Foreshore Act 1933 in recent years have been assessed and prioritized in tandem with the other high level Government objectives in the maritime space. Details for foreshore applications and determinations are available on my Department's website at www.gov.ie/en/collection/f2196-foreshore-applications-and-determinations/</p>  <p>  A further proportion of foreshore applications on hand include licence applications for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy infrastructure.</p>  <p>  My Department has also been prioritising site investigation licence applications linked to qualified Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) projects, known as "relevant projects" or Phase 1 projects, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.  That Department will also shortly conclude the criteria to select a second batch of ORE projects to enter the new maritime consenting system, enabling delivery on our 2030 targets.</p>  <p>  The Government recently approved the prioritisation of renewable energy plans and projects in the Irish maritime area, as a direct response to the energy and climate crises. This decision follows on from the recently agreed Government ambitions for an increase of offshore wind energy, which targets the delivery of an additional 2GW of offshore wind for the production of green hydrogen. Following this decision, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that the following projects in the maritime area will receive priority attention: </p>  <p>  - Any marine infrastructure projects that align with Government decisions to address risks to energy security of supply. </p>  <p>  - Projects that are capable of delivering 200MW or above of offshore renewable energy to meet domestic demand before 2030, using well established, proven technologies. </p>  <p>  - Infrastructure that will support delivery and deployment of Renewable Energy projects such as grid and port facilities. </p>  <p>  - Projects utilising emerging technology that may have the ability to assist the State in meeting its 2030 targets such as floating wind and green hydrogen</p>  <p>  To give effect to this decision, approval has also been given to the immediate development of a Statutory Marine Planning Policy Statement (MPPS) by my Department that will prioritise energy and energy-related projects above all other maritime activities during the six year lifetime of the MPPS. By taking this action, the State&rsquo;s consenting authorities, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the soon to be established Maritime Area Regulatory Authority will prioritise the processing of renewable energy projects, including those that support the development of ORE infrastructure in both the marine and onshore.</p>  <p>  The Foreshore Unit in my Department is currently assessing the current caseload of foreshore lease and licence applications in the context of this Government decision. A key consideration will be how the significant number of site investigation licenses that are on hand and not associated with the Phase 1 projects can be managed given the priority status afforded across Government to applications associated with projects capable of delivering before 2030 using well established technologies.</p>  <p>  The specific long-term plan for the operation of the Moneypoint Power Station is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in the context of energy supply security policy generally.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Management Group to bring forward proposals to my Department that meet the needs of homeless individuals in their administrative area and the funding requirements will be considered in this context. My Department is in active and ongoing discussions with lead authorities of the nine homeless regions concerning the extent of the funding requirements.</p>  <p>  Specifically in relation to Cold Weather Initiatives, these arrangements operate across all local authorities to provide additional emergency beds for rough sleepers where needed.  These arrangements ensure that additional temporary beds can be brought into use across a range of existing services and facilities, for singles and couples who need them during periods of cold weather.  These beds are temporary in nature and it is a matter for individual local authorities to determine the period of their operation. The cold weather arrangements are typically introduced in November and funding will continue to be provided by my Department to meet additional costs associated with these measures.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.

That Review was completed earlier this year culminating in a Strategic Action Plan with fifteen key recommendations to renew the NPWS, establish it as an Executive Agency within a Government Department, and make it a more resilient, more effective organisation, fit to meet the challenges of the twenty first century. This Action Plan was accepted by Government and is now being implemented.</p>  <p>  The Strategic Action Plan for the NPWS sets out an ambitious timeline for a full organisational restructuring of the NPWS, and a substantial &euro;55 million additional investment in the organisation across three  budgetary cycles (from 2023), together with the accelerated early recruitment of at least  60 key staff for critically important roles.</p>  <p>  The NPWS Review and Strategic Action Plan set out the programme required to equip the NPWS to continue to deliver on the ambitious goals, objectives and targets. My officials are currently implementing the recommendations set out in the Review regarding the resource requirement of NPWS and we are engaged in extensive recruitment campaigns across a number of grades including Conservation Rangers.</p>  <p>  There are in excess of 80 Conservation Rangers stationed right across the country at present, and it is my intention to further increase this number, up to 120 Rangers. We are working towards this goal as part of the above increase in resourcing being made available to NPWS. Given the enforcement roles discharged by certain staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, for reasons of operational security, my Department does not provide details of staffing in the manner requested.</p></reply>

The Embassy of Malaysia in Ireland was established in Dublin in November 2001.</p>  <p>  Malaysia remains the only country in the region to have a resident Embassy in Dublin and we are appreciative of the scope that this provides for enhanced economic and political relations. There is excellent ongoing engagement between officials through our respective Embassies.  Last July bilateral consultations took place at official level.</p>  <p>  Cooperation between Ireland and Malaysia continues to grow, particularly in the areas of education, trade, investment and tourism. Over 1,000 Malaysians studied in Ireland in 2021. There is considerable scope for economic ties to develop further and I was pleased to note a 8.5% increase in exports to Malaysia between 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  We also have excellent relations with Malaysia through our engagement at multilateral fora. While I have not met bilaterally with Foreign Minister Abdullah during the past year, we both attended and engaged in a range of discussions at last week's UN General Assembly in New York.

The Department of Foreign Affairs applies the principle of competitive tendering in respect of its contracting for services, goods and works.</p>  <p>  My Department operated a restricted two-stage tender process for the Tokyo works project where the Tender Notice was openly published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) and also published in a prominent Japanese business newspaper.  A Project Management firm, proficient in the Japanese construction market, was engaged as a technical advisor to assist the Department in procuring and managing the contract for the Tokyo construction development.</p>  <p>  The initial requirement sought a response to a pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) from the open market regarding the financial and technical capacity and applying a set selection criteria.  Following the evaluation of five applications, four Tenderers qualified under the pre-qualification questionnaire selection criteria and were invited to submit a full tender proposal to meet the works requirement.  One of these did not avail of the invitation.</p>  <p>  Following a comprehensive evaluation process of the remaining qualified Tenderers, the contract was awarded to the highest scoring Tenderer under the most economically advantageous tender method having regard to the contract award criteria set out in the Tender Notice.</p>  <p>  The competitive tender used by my Department conformed with EU and National procurement procedures while applying Japanese tendering systems to meet the local market requirements.  The tender method ensured that best value for money was achieved through open competitive procurement resulting with the engagement of a reputable professional works contractor.</p></reply>

The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education, based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time, delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets.  Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes.  Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on the potential to extend SIM to other schools.</p><p>The project includes a number of elements:</p><p>- Availability of therapists (speech and language, occupational) to schools to build teacher capacity</p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a front-loaded basis</p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>- Training of SNAs</p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  The Pilot recommenced in November 2021 in CHO7.</p><p>SIM In-School Therapists work in partnership with teachers to co-develop interventions to support children. The interventions are founded in evidence-based occupational therapy (OT) and speech and language therapy (SLT) strategies and techniques, joined with the educational knowledge and experience of the teacher. The interventions are structured to be primarily delivered by the teacher, with support from the therapists.</p><p>The therapists provide relevant training, therapy-based strategies, coaching and modelling support to teachers to build their capacity. To ensure that therapy supports have long lasting impact, the overall focus is on building the capacity of schools and teachers, and embedding interventions into everyday school practices.</p><p>SIM provides a systemic approach to building the capacity of school communities to meet the needs of children. </p><p>There are a number of challenges and barriers to continuing the roll-out of SIM in CHO7 and expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single biggest challenge is the availability of therapists. While the Department&rsquo;s initial intention was to expand SIM to other areas, pressures relating to workforce supply (therapists and psychologists) have resulted in SIM being limited to one CHO area.  This will remain in 2023.</p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) are engaging with CORU (regulatory body over therapists) to determine how the current registration process can be expedited. The HSE are engaging with the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<b></b>(DCEDIY) and Dept. of Higher Education to explore how the Higher Education Institutes can increase third level capacity, with a focus on an initiative to commence in September 2023.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, general up-keep etc. and the Ancillary/School Services Support Fund (SSSF) to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.  Schools also receive a range of other grants including Book Grants, Programme grants etc.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to make precise comparisons between the levels of grants paid and the actual costs of running schools at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  In general, post-primary schools are larger than primary schools. They have specialist rooms such as laboratories, workshops etc.  This leads to higher unit costs for heat, light, power, maintenance and cleaning.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p><p><font color="#001A26">The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</font></p><p>In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p><p>Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. Already 124,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to applicants for the new school year.</p><p>At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600  children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 20,400 additional places have been created a 20% overall increase.  There has been an increase of 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021/2022 school year. </p><p>Additional transport and drivers have been secured to cater for this increased demand for services. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is not available in the manner requested, as numbers are still being finalised for the 2022/23 school year as Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process applications, it is estimated however, that as of 20th September circa 600 on time applications are still in the process of being assessed. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the upcoming school year, has led to some delays in issuing tickets.</p><p>As Bus &Eacute;ireann process remaining applications and where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants.</p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply.</p><p>Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school.</p><p>At post-primary level students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time and who confirmed to Bus &Eacute;ireann that they require a ticket by the 29th July 2022 will be accommodated on school transport services for the 2022/23 school year where such services are in operation.</p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29<sup>th</sup>April and registered for a ticket by 29 July.</p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary, applicants and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat on when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible pupils/students and the priority of providing places for eligible ticket holders, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p></reply>

Children can be enrolled at primary school from the age of 4 upwards and must have started their formal education by 6 years of age.  The upper age limit in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which was recommended to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth by my Department, ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers and limits the age range of children beginning primary school. Limiting the diversity in age ranges in primary school is considered to be generally in the best interest of children, in relation to peer interaction in junior infants, as well as other educational considerations.</p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Childcare was established in 2015 by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to identify and assess policies and future options for increasing the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age childcare and education services in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the IDWG was a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the European Councils&rsquo; 2014 Country Specific Recommendation to Ireland.  The final report of the group was informed by national and international evidence as well as open policy debate and public consultation, and was published in July 2015. </p>  <p>  The report provided a platform for discussion on future investment and set out a number of options and recommendations for the consideration of Government. One of the recommendations proposed by the IDWG was the extension of pre-school provision for all children which considered the most appropriate upper age limit for the ECCE programme, in line with the evidence regarding school start and the importance of children being in an age-appropriate peer group.  Following consideration of the IDWG recommendations and on advice from officials in my Department the upper age limit of the ECCE programme was set at five years and six months.</p></reply>

The areas of Dublin 5, 13 and 17 are managed under the following school planning areas:</p><p>- Dublin 5 &ndash; Beaumont_Coolock SPA and Killester_Raheny_Clontarf SPA;</p><p>- Dublin 13 &ndash; Portmarnock SPA and Donaghmede_Howth_D13 SPA;</p><p>- Dublin 17 &ndash; Darndale_D17 SPA, Portmarnock SPA, Beaumont_Coolock SPA, Donaghmede_Howth SPA and Malahinde_Nevinstown SPA.</p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each local authority to obtain the up-to-date data on significant new residential development in each area.

A further 10% have indicated that they have access to a nearby PE Hall and 5% more have projects in train that will deliver a new PE Hall.  At primary level, over 60% of schools indicated that they currently have a GP room.  In total 70% of primary schools either have a GP room or access to a nearby facility for GP use and a further 3% of primary schools have projects in train which will deliver a new GP room. Practically all schools have outdoor play areas and many schools, use adjacent local facilities, including community halls, public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</p>  <p>  Investment and expenditure on GP rooms and PE Halls is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the School Building Programme. The provision of GP rooms/PE Halls, at primary and post primary level respectively, and outdoor hard play areas form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  However, the second half of the National Development Plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered.</p>  <p>  It is open to the school authority to make an application for additional accommodation through the ASA scheme which is available at www.gov.ie.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for primary and post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas including school planning areas in Dublin 9. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.  </p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Santry and Whitehall, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train, including the provision of modular accommodation where necessary.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  My Department is currently planning the delivery of a major campus project on the current Clonturk Community College site in Whitehall. The project will deliver two new 1,000 pupil post-primary schools and 1 new primary school (8 classrooms) on the Clonturk site.  One of the new post- primary schools will be for Ellenfield Community College to replace their existing school. The new school will include a 4 classroom SEN Base. The other new post-primary school is a replacement school building for Clonturk Community College. The expanded post-primary schools will provide circa 1,200 additional co-educational, multi-denominational post-primary school places in North Dublin City.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently developing the accommodation brief for this significant campus development and is engaging with the school patrons as part of this process.</p>  <p>  The additional capacity being provided by all of these projects is intended to address projected future capacity requirements in the area. </p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools have been notified of the outcome. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.   </p></reply>

This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  There may be instances where there are empty seats on school transport services, particularly at the beginning of the school year some families may prefer to drop or collect their children from school for a period of time.   This may continue on odd days throughout the school year too, based on the family circumstances.</p>  <p>   It is recognised that all pupils issued with tickets will not travel every morning and every evening.   In addition, certain after school activities may also result in pupils not travelling on certain days.</p>  <p>   Bus &Eacute;ireann organises for vehicles to be full to capacity with tickets based on applications received and based on the seating capacity of the vehicle.   It is not feasible to issue additional tickets over and above the seating capacity of the vehicle which could result in a potential overload situation arising and all pupils not being carried on the service.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the child referred to by the Deputy is eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme but was unsuccessful in obtaining a seat on board a school transport service for the 2022/23 school year as they did not complete the ticket registration process by the closing date of 29th July.

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process is based on the principle of concentrated disadvantage and the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. It takes into account the specific enrolment within a school and the proportion of students within that school. The extension of the DEIS programme follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. </p>  <p>  The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school. The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme. Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The area of Clonshaugh, Dublin 17 is located in the Darndale_D17 school planning area.</p><p>There are five primary schools located in the Darndale_D17 school planning area:- <table>    <tr>       <th>Roll Number</th>       <th>School Name</th>       <th>School Type</th>       <th>School Gender_</th>       <th>Ethos Religion</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>17104G </td>       <td>St Francis Junior National School</td>       <td>Ordinary </td>       <td>Mixed Schools</td>       <td>Catholic </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19454U </td>       <td>Darndale NS Junior</td>       <td>Ordinary </td>       <td>Mixed Schools</td>       <td>Catholic </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19524P </td>       <td>Our Lady Immac Sen NS</td>       <td>Ordinary with Special Classes</td>       <td>Mixed Schools</td>       <td>Catholic </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19668Q </td>       <td>St Francis Senior NS</td>       <td>Ordinary with Special Classes</td>       <td>Mixed Schools</td>       <td>Catholic </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>19913D </td>       <td>St Joseph&rsquo;s NS</td>       <td>Ordinary with Special Classes</td>       <td>Mixed Schools</td>       <td>Catholic </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As there is no post primary school serving the Darndale_D17 school planning area pupils are accommodated in the adjacent school planning areas.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>My Department will keep the pace of delivery of additional residential development in the identified school planning areas, along with updated enrolment data and demographic data under continuous review.

The first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy ICT grant funding issued to schools in December 2021. This funding issued directly to schools as schools are best placed to identify the requirements of their own student cohort and to meet those requirements in the most appropriate way. This can include the purchase of ICT devices such as tablets, hybrid devices, or laptops.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, issued a once-off grant of &euro;50 million in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme in order to support those learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide,</p>  <p>  Details of the Grant Scheme for EU NRRP Funding to schools to address the digital divide, and learners at risk of educational disadvantage which can be found at:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/circular/b4fea-grant-scheme-for-eu-nrrp-funding-to-schools-to-address-the-digital-divide-and-learners-at-risk-of-educational-disadvantage/</p>  <p>  Under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 to 2020, &euro;210m in grant funding issued to schools for the provision of digital technology infrastructure, to support schools to implement their digital learning plans.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-27a.770.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092700084#WRP01000"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the question and would like to advise the following:</p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.   </p>  <p>  This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  This includes additional teaching and care supports.</p>  <p>  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen 392 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,543 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 392 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 260 at primary level and 132 at post primary level.</p>  <p>  In relation to the school specifically referenced by the Deputy, I am advised that the NCSE has not identified a requirement for a special class at this school as there are sufficient special class placements available in the area to cater for students with special educational needs requiring the support of a special class.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website.  Following the processing of the appeal received from the school referred to regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model. The Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p>  <p>  School transport is a hugely important service for families.  As you are aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The scope of the review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes. </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of the review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021, with regard to eligibility and with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this report, for the 2021/2022 school year, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  These measures will be continued for the current school year, pending completion of the review and means transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th July.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation; including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments.</p>  <p>  While work on the review is being impacted somewhat by challenges including the pandemic and the impact on resources arising from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the completion of the final phases of the review will be in the shortest timeframe possible.</p></reply>

This includes promotion of healthy lifestyle choices through the curriculum, where appropriate, for example, Physical Education and Social Personal Health Education (SPHE); through schools policy including healthy lunch policies; and by the use of resources and programmes chosen by the school. The Active School Flag (ASF) is one such programme. This work aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge to enable them to make the right choices for healthy lifestyles throughout their lives. </p>  <p>  My Department supports Agri Aware&rsquo;s Incredible Edibles programme, a healthy eating initiative for Primary School pupils, and The Food Dudes Programme, a healthy eating programme developed to encourage children to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>  <p>  Throughout school, our young people are educated about the dangers of eating food which is unhealthy during their primary and second level education. The SPHE programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and in junior cycle. The programme is supported by comprehensive teacher guidelines and curriculum support services, which provide training and advice for schools, and also a resource directory.</p>  <p>  In 2020 the NCCA established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in redeveloping the SPHE/RSE programme and support the development of guidance material for schools.  An immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is underway. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. The Deputy may wish to note that the draft specification for Junior Cycle was published for consultation in July and includes a strand on making healthy choices. Public consultation on the updated junior cycle SPHE curriculum will conclude Oct 18th. I would encourage anyone with an interest in this topic &ndash; students, teachers, parents, stakeholder groups, any member of the public &ndash; to take the opportunity to have your views heard by contributing to this public consultation.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group which is due to commence development on updated primary specifications in Quarter 4 2022, with a draft estimated to be available for public consultation in Quarter 1 2024.</p></reply>

A Career Break is a period of unpaid special leave for not less than 1 school year. It may be extended on an annual basis provided the total period of the Career Break does not exceed 5 years at any one time, subject to an overall maximum of 10 years absence during a teacher&rsquo;s career.</p>  <p>  Under the Career Break Scheme, a teacher may not be employed in an approved teaching or special needs assistant post funded by monies provided by the Oireachtas.

The Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC) forms part of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers, the purpose of which is to provide a forum for claims and proposals relating to the salary, and other terms &amp;amp; conditions of service for teachers. The Council is comprised of representatives from the Teacher Unions, the School Management Bodies, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Education. The TCC is independently chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission. The terms and conditions of teachers employed in State funded teaching posts are formulated at TCC and are of general application to all teachers appointed to such posts.

Where there is a vacancy, schools continue to have access to critical incident support, regional support and development and advisory support from NEPS which may include pupil casework service via the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA). In relation to the school referred to by the Deputy the assigned advisory  psychologist is based in Mullingar and provides the same service as provided by the Sligo office. To note historically Longford schools have been served by either the Sligo or Mullingar office. Decisions in relation to service provision is dependent on staff capacity in local offices. </p><p>The school in question can contact the psychologist by email or phone, this work will typically involve responding to:</p><p>- school enquiries</p><p>- providing for or arranging in indirect casework service</p><p>- arranging for the provision of a direct service  through a SCPA service allocation or through NEPS</p><p>- arranging for the provision of elements of a regional support and development service and/or critical incident support.</p></reply>

These included changes to exam papers, beyond adjustments made at the start of the school year, which gave students added choice and time in the exam hall, relieving pressure and ensuring greater fairness. </p>  <p>  The arrangements for the examinations of 2022 also included a commitment that the results would be, on aggregate, no lower than those of 2021. This reflected the concern that the class of 2022 might be disadvantaged in comparison with 2021, particularly when it came to access to work or further and higher education.  Accordingly a &ldquo;post-marking adjustment&rdquo; was made to all of the results. This means that the overall aggregate set of results for 2022 is no lower than 2021. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the aggregate results were also no higher than in 2021, ie there was no grade inflation this year as compared with last year. In the context of consideration to be given to the complex issue of grade inflation, I have been clear that there will be no "cliff edge" return to pre-pandemic results levels. </p>  <p>  I can also advise that, in recognition that the students sitting 2023 state examinations will have experienced some disruption to teaching and learning, adjustments to exam papers for 2023 were communicated to schools in early September. The level of adjustment will be the same as that announced in August 2021, updated as relevant, and will play to student strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice in the examinations.</p></reply>

The staffing schedule has been improved under both Budgets in the past two years. For the 2022/23 school year, the staffing schedule for primary schools has been improved by one point and our schools are currently staffed at the most favourable level ever seen, on the basis of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils.  Budget 22 also provided lower staffing retention levels for all primary schools. </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.7:1 to 13.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2016/17 school year to the 2021/22 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 27:1 to 25:1.  Average class sizes improved from 24.6 to 22.8 in the same period.</p>  <p>  Further improvements will have to be considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In addition to this work NEPS provides national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students.  NEPS provides the following supports to schools:</p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of well-being and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.</p>  <p>  - NEPS) will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS.</p>  <p>  - NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. </p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed a number of resources to support the well-being of children and young people from Ukraine enrolling in schools in Ireland.  This includes:</p>  <p>  Revised Guidance for primary and post &ndash; primary schools in relation to supporting the well-being of children/young people from Ukraine at this time. This includes support for students with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  Guidance for Parents and Carers from Ukraine on Supporting the Well-being of their Children</p>  <p>  A model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) to help teachers support students. The document is called Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link.</p>  <p>  NEPS has also delivered a series of well-being webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools.</p></reply>

The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education, based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time, delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets.  Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes.  Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on the potential to extend SIM to other schools.  </p><p>The project includes a number of elements:</p><p>- Availability of therapists (speech and language, occupational) to schools to build teacher capacity</p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis</p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>- Training of SNAs</p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  The Pilot recommenced in November 2021 in CHO7.</p><p>There are a number of challenges and barriers to continuing the roll-out of SIM in CH07 and expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single biggest challenge is the availability of therapists.While the Department&rsquo;s initial intention was to expand SIM to other areas, pressures relating to workforce supply (therapists and psychologists) have resulted in SIM being limited to one CHO area.  This will remain in 2023. </p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) are engaging with CORU (regulatory body over therapists) to determine how the current registration process can be expedited.  The HSE are engaging with the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth<b>(</b>DCEDIY) and Dept. of Higher Education to explore how the Higher Education Institutes can increase third level capacity, with a focus on an initiative to commence in September 2023.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann are processing applications and issuing tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service.</p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29 April and registered for a ticket by the 29 July.</p>  <p>  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the children referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for school transport under the terms of the school transport scheme as they are not attending their nearest or second nearest post primary centre.  These pupils were unsuccessful in obtaining concessionary seats for the 2022/23 school year as the existing service is operating to capacity and there are no seats available at present.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 1,043,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially, as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these social welfare schemes is not provided on the basis of a diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way, resources can be targeted to people in most need.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.</p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p>  <p>  Any such change would also require potentially very significant additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I am aware of an ongoing campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties that can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy and who is unable to drive as a result of their condition.  I have met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss its proposal in detail.  </p>  <p>  Following the meeting, I asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland. This work is still ongoing.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers and include help towards recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A 'payment suspend' is inserted on the claim on the date the person returns to employment to ensure that no additional jobseeker&rsquo;s payments issue incorrectly to a person.

There is a range of schemes available to people who make Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. </p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a social insurance payment for people who are deemed permanently incapable of work due to a long-term illness or disability.  Eligibility is subject to a medical assessment and PRSI contribution conditionality.  </p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness, and who have made the necessary PRSI contributions.  Certification for the scheme is by the person&rsquo;s treating physician, in most cases a General Practitioner. </p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme allows a person who is in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit (the latter for 26 weeks) to enter or return to employment or self-employment and to continue to receive a partial or full payment.  Following a medical assessment, if a person's restriction regarding their capacity for work is rated as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50%, 75% or 100% of their previous income support payment.  Partial Capacity Benefit has also been designed so there are no restrictions or limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to reduce the 26 weeks eligibility rule from Illness Benefit to Partial Capacity Benefit at this time.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, the Department has committed to developing and consulting on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments to simplify the system; remove inconsistencies and anomalies, recognise the continuum of disability and to support employment.  Work is currently underway within the Department, with a public consultation process to commence in due course.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep its range of supports under review to ensure that they meet their overall objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

No. 301 of 2006 in order to take account of the Government decision of January 2019 that requirements of the IORP II Directive would apply to all relevant pension arrangements by removing existing exemptions applying to certain schemes.</p>  <p>  IORP II sets out minimum standards for the management and supervision of pension schemes with the objective of ensuring the soundness of occupational pensions and better protections for scheme members and beneficiaries across the European Union.  </p>  <p>  The general principle followed in respect of the transposition of IORP II, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform, is that the requirements of IORP II apply to all schemes and trust RACs including one-member arrangements (&lsquo;OMAs&rsquo;).  This is in order to ensure that all members and beneficiaries are afforded equal protection irrespective of the size of the pension arrangement.  It should be noted that the decision to apply the requirements of IORP II to all schemes and trust RACs was announced by the Government in 2019 and it was expected that trustees and insurance providers would have been preparing for compliance with these requirements in advance of transposition.  IORP II was transposed into Irish law through the European Union (Occupational Pension Schemes) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 128 of 2021) and came into effect on 22 April 2021.</p>  <p>  In relation to existing OMAs (already established on or before S.I. No. 128 of 2021 came into effect on 22 April 2021), a five-year derogation from that date applies in respect of new IORP II requirements.</p>  <p>  In the context of OMAs established on or after that date, the April 2021 regulations did not provide for any form of derogation from IORP II requirements and, consequently, such arrangements are required to meet all such new requirements, as appropriate, from the date they were established.  From a supervision perspective, the Pensions Authority has, however, outlined that it was applying a deadline of 1st July 2022 in respect of OMA&rsquo;s compliance with those new requirements. </p>  <p>  My Department's role is to oversee the pension sector from a policy perspective which includes formulating and implementing pensions policy-related measures including transposing EU pension-related instruments into Irish law.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority, which is the independent regulator for pensions in Ireland (and the competent authority within the meaning of IORP II), is responsible for supervising compliance with the requirements of both IORP II and the Pensions Act 1990.  The Pensions Authority has advised that it published information for trustees on its website on 14th July 2022 setting out its position on the implementation of the audited report requirements provided for under the regulations referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 1,320 people in receipt of diet supplement.</p>  <p>  A review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute was commissioned by my Department during 2013.  The research showed that the average costs across all the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one-third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) rate, which was then paid at &euro;186 per week (and is currently paid at &euro;206 per week).  The diet supplement scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 February 2014 based on this evidence.</p>  <p>  Recipients continue to receive the diet supplement at their existing rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  Supports provided under the scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single Additional Needs Payments (ANPs). </p>  <p>  Under the SWA scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, officers can make a single ANP to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Decisions on ANPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</p>  <p>  Any person who considers that they may have an entitlement to financial support should contact their local Community Welfare Service for assistance. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  Based on an average of 371,000 households qualifying for fuel allowance payment in 2023 and a 28-week fuel allowance season, it is estimated that increasing the fuel allowance rate by &euro;8 a week to &euro;41 would cost an additional &euro;83.1 million.</p>  <p>  Increasing the rate of Fuel Allowance would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

This includes the provision of a State-wide intensive employment service for those furthest from the labour market - the new Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Service (IPLAES).  This new service will for the first time cover all of County Wicklow.  </p>  <p>  In a competition run in accordance with EU procurement rules, 17 community and voluntary sector organisations were successful and were awarded contracts to provide the new IPLAES.  These contracts replace the previous Local Employment Service and Job Club contracts.  16 of these contracts are now in place and the new service is being mobilised with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  County Wicklow was partnered in a Lot with County Kildare for the purposes of the new employment service.  The successful bidder was Bray Area Partnership, with another Kildare-based community body as sub-contractor.</p>  <p>  The Wicklow-Kildare IPLAES is part of a State-wide expansion that represents a significant increase in state investment in these services from &euro;23m per annum to &euro;39m per annum exclusive of VAT.  The services represent a substantial expansion on employment services previously available to the long term unemployed cohort who will benefit from this new expanded service. </p>  <p>  It is forecast that this new service will mean that in the Wicklow-Kildare area some &euro;2.7 million per annum will be spent engaging with those furthest from the labour market, an increase of almost 90% of the previous funding.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

CE sponsoring authorities receive state funding to cover the cost of remuneration, training and material costs from the department.  CE scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.</p>  <p>  The employees concerned are not public servants, but employees of individual schemes.   Any increase in pay rates that would potentially increase the overall cost to the state of funding schemes or state funded activities in the wider community and voluntary sector must take into consideration the potential cost to the exchequer.  </p>  <p>  My Department acknowledges the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors and assistant supervisors provide in running CE schemes in delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that each recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  If a claimant is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the means of the couple will be assessed.  This is the case even if only one of the couple is actually claiming a payment.  The means assessed include income from employment or self-employment, non-social welfare pensions, and the capital value of savings, investments and property other than the family home.  It should be noted that the value of the family home, regardless of who is the legal owner, is never taken into account in this assessment. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the full value of capital is not assessed.  The standard formula for assessing the value of capital for most social welfare payments is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  </p>  <p>  Any proposals to change the means assessment formulas for social assistance schemes would have to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-27a.912.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092700086#WRR03400"><p>Widow&rsquo;s Pension (contributory) is a weekly social insurance payment to those covered by social insurance whose spouse or civil partner has died.</p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the main income support provided to those who cannot work due to illness of any kind and who are covered by social insurance.</p>  <p>  If a customer is getting a reduced rate of Widow&rsquo;s Pension, they may also get a reduced rate of Illness Benefit, so that the combined amount of both payments is not greater than the rate of Illness Benefit to which they are entitled.</p>  <p>  However, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally they can receive only one  payment.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.  As a result, people on Widow&rsquo;s Pension cannot be in receipt of an overlapping second payment, for example Illness Benefit, at the same time.</p>  <p>  This department provides long-term payments to those who cannot work due to an illness or disability in the form of Disability Allowance and Invalidity Pension.  These are not payable at the same time as Widow's Pension.  However, the person may apply for these payments if they are more appropriate to the person's individual needs and circumstances. </p>  <p>  People might be eligible to receive one of the supports below in addition to their Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension:</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment is a weekly means-tested tax-free payment available to employees with children.  A person can receive Working Family Payment (if they meet the criteria) and get a Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension at the same time.  Full details are available and updated regularly on the www.gov.ie website.  The Widow's, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  A person might also be eligible to receive Living Alone Increase, Fuel Allowance or Household Benefits Package depending on their living circumstances and their age.</p>  <p>  My Department operates the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, administered by the Community Welfare Service, which provides a number of supports and services to help people facing financial hardship.  Under this scheme, the Department may make an additional needs payment to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently on a social welfare payment or working on a low income.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep the range of supports under review.  However, changing the underlying one person-one payment principle would involve significant additional expenditure which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 1,043,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  The objective of the Free Travel scheme is to ensure that older people and people with disabilities remain active within their community.  The scheme was never intended as a targeted support for people with severe mobility issues or to address the transport requirements of all persons with long-term health conditions or disabilities and therefore no review of the free travel scheme has been carried out to address the transport requirements of this cohort of people. </p>  <p>  While the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, referred to by the Deputy did recommend uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme, implementation of the proposed recommendation would entail a fundamental change to the very nature of the free travel scheme and a significant increase in the numbers qualifying for the scheme &ndash; beyond the customer base of the Department &ndash; the details of which would not be available to this Department.  In essence, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from the Department of Social Protection to become a general transport initiative. </p>  <p>  It could also be expected that extensive negotiations, including negotiations around levels of recompense, would have to be undertaken with transport operators to ensure their continued participation in such a considerably revised scheme. </p>  <p>  Any such change would also require potentially very significant additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Participation on the scheme is part time - 19.5 hours per week.</p>  <p>  There are currently just over 18,700 participants on CE.  In order to assist schemes to maintain services in the current tight labour market and improve recruitment, Minister Humphreys and I announced a number of reforms to CE in December 2021 and again in June 2022 - allowing all those over 60 to remain on schemes until they reach retirement age and to permit further extensions to participants' contracts where no replacement has been referred to fill places.</p>  <p>  The payment rates on CE are related to the underlying value of certain social protection payments plus &euro;22.50 per week.  In addition, a participant may be eligible for payments in respect of any qualified dependent adult and children.  If a CE participant's underlying payment (including dependents) is &euro;208 a week or less, they receive the minimum CE weekly rate of &euro;230.50, that is &euro;208 plus the top up of &euro;22.50.  If a participant's underlying payment (including dependents) is &euro;208 or more, then they receive the same rate as their social protection payment plus &euro;22.50.</p>  <p>  CE participants can retain their medical card and can also retain any additional benefits they were entitled to on their underlying scheme prior to joining CE, for example Fuel Allowance, provided they continue to satisfy the qualifying conditions for those benefits.</p>  <p>  Any increase in payments to CE participants is a matter for Budget 2023.

The programme aims to improve participants' opportunities to return to work in the labour market.</p>  <p>  As the economy and society emerged from COVID,  it was clear that some schemes were encountering difficulties maintaining services, as participants with COVID related extended contracts started to leave schemes from April 2022.  This led to an increased turnover of participants which could have had an impact on services provided by schemes.  As a consequence, Minister Humphreys and I introduced a number of reforms to CE, to minimise the impact on schemes and services they provide.</p>  <p>  One of the changes introduced allowed CE participants whose contract term was coming to an end, to stay on CE until a replacement was referred to the scheme to take up this place.  Any extension under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the any remaining impact of COVID on the turnover and recruitment of participants, services provided by schemes, along with recruitment and referral efforts.  Approximately 900 participants have had their contracts extended on this basis since the start of April.</p>  <p>  It remains important that CE places are available for persons who are long term unemployed to assist them return to employment in the labour market.  Therefore extensions are only approved in specific circumstances where an extension will not prevent an incoming long term unemployed person the opportunity to take up a CE place.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

My Department intends, where possible, to continue to offer its many customers the choice of being paid in cash at the post office or directly into an account in a financial institution by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). </p>  <p>  For some social welfare schemes, it can be mandatory for a payment to be collected in cash at a post office.  For example, some social welfare scheme rules require a customer to prove that they are resident in the state and are available for work.  These payment method restrictions are limited and in most cases a customer can choose the payment method most convenient for them.</p>  <p>  Social Welfare payments made directly into customer accounts by EFT can be paid into any financial institution, whether they are commercial banks, credit unions or An Post.  This includes new online banks, also known as &lsquo;Fin Techs&rsquo;, provided the accounts in these institutions have a valid BIC and IBAN which complies with Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) rules.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department is able to make EFT payments to the financial institution named in the details supplied and that it has been doing so successfully for a couple of years. </p>  <p>  This is in line with EU Regulation 260/2012 (the SEPA Regulation) which forbids restricting payments to specific financial institutions within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  Therefore, the Department is required to make payments to all financial institutions licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland and is prohibited from favouring any Irish financial institution over one in another European Union member state or within the wider SEPA zone.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Central Bank is the competent authority to ensure compliance with Regulation 260/2012.  This regulation came into effect in Ireland in 2014.  As the competent authority, the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to impose penalties on any Government Department for non-compliance with the Regulation.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of a specific case where a customer of the Department has had difficulty getting paid into a specific financial institution, which is SEPA compliant, then I would be grateful if she could bring this matter to the attention of my officials as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The funding for the programme amounted to around &euro;16 million and was provided jointly under the European Union&rsquo;s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer.  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Final Evaluation of the Ability Programme was published at its conclusion.</p>  <p>  Last year, I put a plan in place to allow for the transition of the remaining Ability providers and participants to new arrangements and this was agreed with the Ability Providers Subgroup following a meeting with this group.  This included a two-month extension to the 26 organisations still operating under the programme at that time. </p>  <p>  The current Dormant Accounts Fund Measure to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities was a new employment support measure for people with disabilities.  On 30 July last year I announced that 45 projects had been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million.  This programme began in September and runs up to the end of 2022.  All 27 organisations who received funding under the former Ability Programme were successful in securing funding under this new measure, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  It was agreed that a new employment programme for people with disabilities would be included in the new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  This new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings of the former Ability Programme.  The new programme will also need to add complementarity to the suite of existing employment supports targeted at people with disabilities provided by my department and broader national strategies for employment of people with disabilities, including the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - has compiled the Operational Programme for Ireland which has been approved by Government.  The Operational Programme has been formally submitted to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year. </p>  <p>  Once approval is in place, it is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process in 2023 to applications from organisations across the country, including the 27 former Ability Programme organisations referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my commitment in relation to providing funding supports to improve the employment possibilities of people with disabilities has not been found wanting to date and that the organisation&rsquo;s concern raised by the Deputy is acknowledged and noted.  However, the Deputy will understand that commitments regarding the allocation of public expenditure are subject to the overall budgetary context and must be considered accordingly. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 consecutive months.  This level of care and attention must be required to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living.  Eligibility for DCA is determined primarily by reference to the degree of ongoing additional care and attention required by the child rather than the child's disability.</p>  <p>  While an assessment or diagnosis of a specific disability such as ASD may assist the Department's deciding officers and medical assessors to make an appropriate decision on entitlement and at the earliest date possible, eligibility is not based on the type of disability but on the resulting medical and additional care needs.  The assessment process that applies in the consideration of whether a child satisfies the criteria for receipt of DCA includes the examination of all relevant factors identified as impacting on the child's additional care needs.  A diagnosis of ASD alone or any other disability or condition does not necessarily indicate the level of care required by the child.</p>  <p>  Applications for DCA are decided by a deciding officer on a case by case basis, while also considering the opinion of a Departmental medical assessor.  In addition to the personal details supplied on the completed application form (Dom Care 1), including the signed details from the applicant's GP on this form, the applicant may provide any additional information or documentary evidence that is relevant to their application, such as medical professional report(s) if available, but there is no specific requirement to provide this information.</p>  <p>  A parent / guardian should apply for DCA once they consider that their child may meet the qualifying conditions for the allowance.  It is also open to an applicant to subsequently request a review of any decision and this right is not time limited.  If requesting a review of a deciding officer's decision, an applicant may forward further new documentary or medical evidence that was not previously available with the initial DCA application for further consideration. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

These schemes provide that a person can work up to 3 days per week, where they are fully unemployed for at least four in any seven consecutive days.  In relation to Jobseeker's Allowance a disregard of &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60 per week (3 days) applies to earnings from employment.  The balance is then assessed at 60%. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Jobseeker schemes, the Working Family Payment (WFP) is a tax free in-work support which provides an income top-up for low-earning employees with children.  Once awarded, WFP is generally payable for a minimum period of 52 weeks as long as the recipient continues to be engaged in paid employment as an employee for not less than 38 hours per fortnight with the same employer.  There is no upper limit on the number of hours or days a person can work.  The average total weekly family income must be below the relevant income threshold for the family's size.  The payment is calculated at 60% of the difference between the total family income and the income threshold that applies to the family.</p>  <p>  The Back To Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) scheme supports those who had been in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment (including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition payment) and One-Parent Family Payment, to retain their full increase for a qualified child payment for the first year of employment, tapering to 50 per cent in the second year.</p>  <p>  There is no limit on the number of hours or days a person in receipt of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) for lone parents, subject to satisfying the means test.  Under these schemes the first &euro;165 of gross weekly earnings is disregarded and only half of the remainder is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carers Allowance, Carers Benefit and Carers Support Grant payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  However, a carer can work or engage in education or training for up to 18.5 hours per week. </p>  <p>  In terms of reviewing working age social welfare supports, consideration is being given to the development of a new pay-related Jobseeker's Benefit payment as committed to in the Programme for Government.  Consideration is also being given to the development of a new Working Age Payment, as committed to in Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  Options will be examined to modify the longer-term assistance payment, including Jobseeker's Allowance, by utilising Revenue real time earnings data to adjust payment levels in line with a person&rsquo;s weekly earnings, to guarantee a basic income floor, and to ensure that in all cases a person&rsquo;s income increases when they work.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

These contributions are solely from the fact that the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) they hold attracts a self employed contribution.  In order to qualify under Jobseekers Benefit for the Self Employed, self-employment must also have ceased.  As the Approved Retirement Fund is ongoing, the customer concerned cannot on the one hand use the self employed contributions from this to establish an entitlement yet at the same time then want those contributions  discounted or ignored when it comes to satisfying the 2nd condition of   not being engaged in self-employment.</p>  <p>My officials have been reviewing the issue of the treatment of ARFs in relation to the Benefit Payment for over 65s and I expect to have the outcome of this review in the near future.</p></reply>

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance. Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.  </p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  You may be aware that Tusla are in the process of developing a Strategic Plan on Foster Care 2022-2025 and I am aware that Tusla has recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of the Plan.Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently finalising the plan, which will then be considered by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance falls under the remit of the Department of Social Protection. For more information on payments made by the Department of Social Protection, please contact the Department of Social Protection, &Aacute;ras Mhic Dhiarmada, Store Street, Dublin 1, D01 WY03, phone 01-704 3000, or email: info@welfare.ie.

Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme</p>  <p>  AIM level 7 support provides additional funding to pre-schools who have a child requiring extra support. Providers can use this funding either to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting.  </p>  <p>  AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Accordingly, any staff member hired under AIM is a shared resource for all children in the pre-school room and one additional staff member may be deemed to be sufficient to meet the needs of two or more children who have been granted additional capitation, where these children are attending the same pre-school session.</p>  <p>  Staff hired under AIM Level 7 must satisfy the qualification requirements of the Early Years Services Regulations 2016, which stipulate that all staff working in pre-school services must have, at minimum, a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 of the National Framework for Qualifications (NFQ) or a qualification deemed by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to be equivalent. The DCEDIY approved list of Early Years recognised qualifications can be found at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/297c05-early-years-recognised-qualifications/.</p></reply>

However, it should be noted that ELC and SAC services are provided by private enterprises, either privately owned or operated by community organisations. My Department is not involved in decisions around the day to day running of such services and any decision to close is ultimately a matter for the service provider and, in this case, the building owner. My Department cannot intervene in disputes between service providers and building owners.</p>  <p>  I have contacted Tusla in relation to this matter. Tusla notes that it is aware of, and empathises with, the difficulties faced by the children, parents and staff as a result of the ongoing situation at this childcare service. Tusla does not have a remit to intervene in ongoing third-party disputes such as the one outlined in this case, as the statutory powers of the Agency are limited solely to the regulation of ELC and SAC services, as prescribed by legislation.  </p>  <p>  Tusla noted that this matter is currently before the courts and on this basis it would not be appropriate to provide any additional comment on this individual case, pending the outcome of these proceedings. </p>  <p>  Tusla remains at the disposal of the service provider in this case, to assist in the progression of any matters in relation to the ongoing registration and regulation of the service in line with the relevant statutory requirements. Should the provider have any additional queries in this respect, these can be directed to Tusla&rsquo;s Early Years Inspectorate either by telephone on 061 461700, or by email at ey.reception@tusla.ie.</p>  <p>  The service provider may also wish to contact their local CCC to discuss what supports may be available to them.

I recognise that childminders are highly valued by many parents because of the home-from-home setting, their strong and lasting relationships, and the flexibility they can offer. Many families prefer to use childminders, while for some families, in areas where centre-based care is either not available or its opening hours do not match the family&rsquo;s childcare needs, childminding is the only option.</p>  <p>  The limitation of public funding schemes to Tusla-registered ELC and SAC providers helps to ensure that public funding is provided where there is assurance of the quality of provision. While only a small number of childminders are currently required to register with Tusla under the Child Care Act 1991, it is intended that the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028 will result in the opening up of the National Childcare Scheme to a much wider cohort of childminders.</p>  <p>  The National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028, which I launched in April 2021, sets out a plan for extending State support and regulation to childminding on a phased basis over the coming years. The overall objective of the National Action Plan for Childminding is to improve access to high quality and affordable ELC and SAC through childminding.  </p>  <p>  To do this, the Action Plan sets out an incremental and supportive pathway to regulation. This will enable more childminders to access Government subsidies, making their services more affordable to parents. It will also enable them to access a variety of supports to assist them in meeting regulatory and quality requirements. The National Action Plan for Childminding commits to develop new childminder-specific regulations that are proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan has a number of specific objectives including: </p>  <p>  - Enable a far greater number of parents who use childminders to benefit from subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme.  </p>  <p>  - Support quality assurance of childminders and safeguarding of children through extending the scope of regulation and inspection to all paid, non-relative childminders.   </p>  <p>  - Provide greater recognition of childminders and develop appropriate childminder regulations and inspection processes to reflect the home environment in which childminders work. </p>  <p>  - Provide a supportive, phased transition process, to facilitate the largest possible number of childminders to enter the regulated sector, the sphere of quality assurance, and access to Government subsidies, while recognising the time and supports required for this reform.   </p>  <p>  - Support retention and recruitment of childminders. </p>  <p>  Parents currently experiencing difficulty in relation to their ELC and SAC needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance. Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need. </p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  Tusla are in the process of developing a Strategic Plan on Foster Care 2022-2025 and I am aware that Tusla has recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of the Plan. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently finalising the plan, which will then be considered by my Department.</p></reply>

This table sets out the estimated year on year cost of the scheme from Year 0 to Year 5, with Year 0 representing start-up costs relating to the establishment of the Executive Office to administer the scheme and Year 1 being the first year of operation.The Interdepartmental Group estimated costs of &euro;313 million for the Scheme in its first year of operation, the bulk of this expenditure (over 90%) will be incurred on financial payments and providing the enhanced medical card. These costs also anticipated that 50% of all potential applicants will apply to the Scheme in the first year of operation. </p>  <p>  Funding has been provided in Budget 2022 to cover the estimated setup (Year 0) costs for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme. Provision for the Scheme in 2023 will be made once the legislation is enacted and is expected to form part of the Revised Estimates process.</p></reply>

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. </p>  <p>  It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow relative foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child.</p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to relative foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.  In considering any additional payment or enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child. </p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Enhanced allowances for relative foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. </p>  <p>  Tusla are in the process of developing a Strategic Plan on Foster Care 2022-2025 and I am aware that Tusla has recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of the Plan. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently finalising the plan, which will then be considered by my Department.</p></reply>

The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p><p>The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2022.

In that regard, I allocated additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarship by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for the Irish Research Council (IRC) and Science Foundation Ireland (SFI).</p>  <p>  I am examining a range of options to support students in this year&rsquo;s Budget, including PhD students.</p>  <p>  Impact 2030, Ireland&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Strategy prioritises the nurturing and development of talent and excellence to build on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an Island of Talent and a location for research excellence and impact. The strategy recognises that the quality of our researchers is fundamental to the quality of our research system, its collaboration with partners in industry and policymakers, both in Ireland and abroad. The strategy also highlights the need to foster an environment within the research and innovation community that supports our ambition to be an Island of Inclusion and Engagement.</p></reply>

The definition of an approved institution is set out in Section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 3 of the Student Support Regulations 2022. Private colleges operated on a for-profit basis are not listed as approved institutions for student grant purposes.  </p>  <p>  However, it is open to higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to any of their students that they consider to be in particular need.  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that private colleges are autonomous bodies that do not fall under the remit of my Department, and accordingly the question of me directing them to adopt or retain certain practices does not arise.  </p>  <p>  However, I can confirm that in relation to the national student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland), the following arrangements are in place to ensure students and their parents are made aware that student grant assistance only applies to eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution:</p>  <p>  The "Eligibility Criteria" page of SUSI&rsquo;s website clearly states that to be eligible for funding, an applicant must be attending an "approved course in an approved institution" (as defined in the relevant Student Grant Scheme and associated legislation).</p>  <p>  Additional links on this webpage provide more information regarding the type of course a student may wish to pursue, be it PLC, undergraduate, postgraduate or study outside the state. On these linked dedicated pages, it is again re-iterated that students must be attending an approved course in an approved institution for student grant purposes. Lists of all the approved institutions and the approved courses that each institution offers is also provided.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there is a webpage dedicated to approved courses and institutions for undergraduate students which lists a number of institutions that provide courses offered through the CAO which are not eligible for SUSI funding.</p>  <p>  Apart from the information available on SUSI's website, representatives from SUSI also attend various events such as college Open Days and Higher Options events throughout the year, with the aim of meeting students and answering any questions they may have about the application process. This involves providing information regarding student grant eligibility criteria, including the fact that students must be attending an approved course in an approved college to avail of SUSI grant assistance. This information is also available to students as part of the accompanying suite of assets created to support these events, which includes video presentations and digital leaflets which can be viewed on the SUSI website.</p>  <p>  In addition, SUSI deliver training to key stakeholders including Institute of Guidance Counsellors members, Citizens Information staff, HEI Access officers and St. Vincent de Paul representatives each year to enable them to assist students with regard to the eligibility criteria and application process.</p></reply>

The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependents of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.</p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is considered to be a short-term social welfare payment and, therefore, it is not included as an eligible payment for the purposes of the special rate of maintenance grant. 391 days is the time period as determined by the Department of Social Protection for a social welfare payment to be regarded as long term, and refers to social welfare days as opposed to calendar days.  Illness Benefit is operated by the Department of Social Protection on a 6 day week basis.</p>  <p>  The 391 day requirement for the purposes of qualifying for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme is operated in line with the arrangements as determined by the Department of Social Protection and follows its interpretation as to what it considers to be a long term payment.  However, the Student Grant Scheme also makes provision for combining periods of Illness Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting the 391 days eligibility requirement for the special rate of grant.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grant Appeals Board.</p></reply>

Otherwise, he/she would be assessed as a dependent student, i.e. assessed with reference to parental income and address. </p>  <p>  A student&rsquo;s status for grant purposes is defined at their first point of entry to an approved further or higher education course or at their point of re-entry to an approved course following a break in studies of at least three years, and continues to apply for the duration of their studies. </p>  <p>  However, there are points at which a student may reclassify from a dependent student to an independent student. These are where he/she: </p>  <p>  - Progresses from further education to higher education. </p>  <p>  - Is returning following a 3 year break in studies.   </p>  <p>  - Is returning as a "second chance" student after a five year break in studies.</p>  <p>  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. A student may wish to discuss his/her individual circumstances with the SUSI Support Desk by calling 0818 888 777.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student. The relevant information, including details of parental income, would be required by SUSI to determine grant eligibility as a dependent student. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). Students can apply for the SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs, medical costs and books/class materials. This Fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis and assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education.  The aim is to ensure that students can participate fully in education, or on an equal basis with their peers.  The Disability Officers actively promote the ethos of inclusive learning for all students. Recently the FSD has also been used for projects to develop strategic disability services in HEIs and supports for students. Examples include inclusive design in teaching and learning, improving online teaching and learning practices, staff training, improving campus experience for students with disabilities, assistive technology supports and autism-friendly spaces.</p>  <p>  I would also encourage students to review information on the student assistant fund, the fund for students with Disabilities and other financial supports available at www.studentfinance.ie and to contact their Access Office in the third level institution attended for details of any further supports.</p></reply>

In line with these commitments, a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact on immigration processing times, including the introduction of online applications, a new customer service helpdesk and a new customer focused immigration website. </p>  <p>  As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the assignment of additional staff to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were made. This is the highest number of decisions made annually since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. </p>  <p>  For the first six months of 2022, almost 7,900 citizenship decisions have been issued, including 1,005 decisions on minor applications. This exceeds the total number of decisions on minor applications issued during the whole of last year, when 868 minor decisions were made.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is freeing up staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will help to reduce processing times. </p>  <p>  A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p></reply>

The forms had originally been introduced to support provisions under Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 which were repealed when the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 was introduced. The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) formed the view that there was insufficient legal basis to support continued use of the forms. </p><p>I am advised that the Financial Intelligence Unit engaged on plans to rescind the ML10 with the Banking Payments Federation of Ireland and engaged separately with the Irish League of Credit Unions, Credit Union Development Association, Credit Union Managers Association and PAYAC.  </p><p>The Deputy may be aware that the 2010 Act does not specify the types of documentation to be used by designated businesses (either financial or non-financial) for customer due diligence purposes. </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland has issued Anti-Money Laundering guidelines which are available on their website &ndash; www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/regulation/amld-/guidance/anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism-guidelines-for-the-financial-sector.pdf?sfvrsn=9 </p><p>The Central Bank is the competent authority responsible for supervising financial institutions under the 2010 Act.  </p><p>The Central Bank has not included prescriptive / definitive examples of documentation that it considers would satisfy customer identification and verification requirements. It says that firms, in applying a risk-based approach, should maintain their own lists of documents, which they will accept, in satisfaction of this obligation and in accordance with relevant Sections 33 to 39 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 that set out obligations on customer due diligence.</p><p>Firms that are subject to regulation for money laundering purposes should set out in their written policies and procedures (which each designated business must have under section 54 of the Act) the documents and information which they are willing to accept and the circumstances under which they are willing to accept them in order to identify and verify the identity of their customer in circumstances where due diligence purposes must be carried out. Firms should retain records evidencing identity in either paper or electronic format. It is a matter for designated businesses to set out their policies and procedures in relation to identification and verification of their customers and to satisfy their supervisory body as to the adequacy of the arrangements.</p><p>The Banking Payments Federation of Ireland also publish guidance on documents that may be acceptable for the purposes of identification and verification in the context of customer due diligence. The guidance is available on their website - bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Final-BPFI-Guide-to-Opening-Bank-Accounts-in-Ireland-for-Protection-Applicants-Final.pdf </p><p>This guidance indicates that while passport and EU or Irish driving licence are accepted as standard forms of proof of identity, a bank will accept alternative documents as proof of identity, if the applicant does not have either a passport or a driving licence. These include, for example: Irish Residence Permit; Temporary Residence Certificate or Irish Government Travel Document (UN Issued.)</p></reply>

Offences will include inciting hatred against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected characteristic, and dissemination or distribution of material inciting hatred.</p>  <p>  The protected characteristics that underpin the new legislation are race; colour; nationality; religion, ethnic or national origin; sexual orientation; gender (including gender expression or gender identify); and disability.</p>  <p>  Development of this legislation follows a comprehensive consultation process that began in 2019 and included public events across Ireland, along with surveys, consultation and engagement with people with lived experience of the impact of hate speech and hate crime.</p>  <p>  The text of the new legislation is currently in the final stages of drafting, and it is expected to go to Government for approval in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

My Department has responsibility or part responsibility for 34 of the 66 actions contained in the Action Plan, 26 of which are now complete, including the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 and the establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office, which was opened by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last July. </p>  <p>  In June of this year, I received Government approval to reform duty of care legislation, which is a key insurance reform measure and an important part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan.</p>  <p>  I am proposing to amend a number of sections of the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995, in line with the Government policy objective of restricting the liability of occupiers. I believe these proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that businesses, community groups and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities, while also acknowledging the importance of personal responsibility of visitors, recreational users and trespassers.</p>  <p>  The proposed amendments, which build on a Review Paper prepared by my Department in February 2021, and subsequently published, contain four key developments:</p>  <p>  - they will reflect in primary legislation a number of recent court decisions which rebalance the duty of care owed by occupiers to visitors and recreational users;</p>  <p>  - they change the standard to clarify that when the occupier of a property has acted with reckless disregard for a recreational user or trespasser, the standard of reckless disregard rather than that of reasonable grounds should apply in relation to any consideration of liability;</p>  <p>  - they limit the circumstances in which a court can impose liability on the occupier of a premises where a person has entered onto premises for the purpose of committing an offence; and</p>  <p>  - they allow for a broader range of scenarios where it can be shown that a visitor or recreational user has voluntarily assumed a risk.</p>  <p>  The Office of Parliamentary Counsel, working with my Department, will draft the legislative provisions which will be included as Committee Stage amendments to the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.</p></reply>

It is open to the applicants to appeal these decisions, in writing, within two months of the date of the refusal. Appeals must be in written form and sent to the Visa Appeals Officer in the relevant Visa Office. Faxed or emailed appeals will not be considered. </p><p>www.irishimmigration.ie/appeal-a-negative-decision/</p><p>When making an appeal, the applicants should take into account the reasons for refusal listed in the refusal letters.

Full consideration will be given to any appeal received on behalf of the applicants, however the onus is on the applicants to satisfy the Visa Officer that visas should be granted.</p><p>It should be noted that the granting of a work permit by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) has no bearing on whether a visa will be subsequently granted.

The framework of measures agreed include the establishment of the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR). </p>  <p>  Given the cross-border nature of the ICIR, in September 2015, the Government signed an International Agreement with the British Government on the establishment of the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR).  The development of proposals for legislation to establish the ICIR in this jurisdiction have been progressed, in close cooperation with the Department of Foreign Affairs,  and Heads of Bill are well advanced. However, ICIR will require legislation to be enacted in both jurisdictions with parallel provisions in order for it to come into effect, which is presenting a particular difficulty at the current time.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK Government published the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill in May. The Bill has passed through the House of Commons and is currently being considered by the House of Lords. The Bill does not provide for an Independent Commission for Information Retrieval as set out in the Stormont House Agreement and therefore our legislation cannot be progressed at this time. The Irish Government has expressed its opposition to this legislation, as have all political parties in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Commission for Human Rights, many victims groups and others. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage and work with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland on this very important issue.</p></reply>

As part of its overall commitment to energy saving and the climate agenda, steps have been taken to eliminate the use of non-essential lighting, where appropriate and safe to do so, such as switching off lighting used to illuminate the exterior of buildings at night.

All public sector bodies will take a leading role in lowering their energy consumption and costs by implementing the Reduce Your Use energy efficiency campaign. </p>  <p>  The Reduce Your Use energy efficiency campaign is designed to target reductions in energy use including targeted reductions in energy use by public sector bodies, through simple and easy to implement measures.</p>  <p>  Public sector bodies will be required to set temperatures to a guideline 19 degrees where appropriate, turning off heat in office buildings at least 1-2 hours before the buildings close and ensuring that there is no non-security/safety lighting in use after 8:00pm. However, this requirement allows for consideration of the public service being delivered at that location, and the suitability of reducing temperatures in particular circumstances. </p>  <p>  It is expected that this campaign can deliver 5-10% energy savings overall across the sector, and up to 15% in buildings.</p></reply>

The Minister is delivering on that commitment by preparing Heads of a General Scheme of a Sale of Alcohol Bill.</p>  <p>  The objective of the proposed Bill is to repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, and to replace them with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. In addition, codifying alcohol licensing law into a single Act will make it more accessible and user-friendly for the licensed trade, courts, Garda&iacute; and the public.</p>  <p>  The creation of new categories of intoxicating liquor licences in order to meet the needs of new areas of activity in the hospitality sector is under consideration.</p>  <p>  Changes in alcohol licensing laws must be balanced with the need for regulation in the public interest, in particular, public health and public order. Reforms will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses, and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.</p>  <p>  Work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the General Scheme is advancing well. This is a reform on which there are many views across society, and the legislation needs to be informed by those views.</p>  <p>  Last November, the Minister launched a wide-ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing laws. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups, and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to the Department.</p>  <p>  There was a high level of response to the consultation, with in excess of 5,000 responses received. The Department has reviewed these responses to ensure the reform of the legislation takes account of and is informed by this engagement.</p>  <p>  On 10th March, the Minister hosted a consultation webinar and panel discussion event on the reform of the alcohol licensing laws to give an opportunity for further discussion of the issues of concern to stakeholders. That webinar can be viewed on the Department&rsquo;s YouTube channel via the following link: youtu.be/0tMtKzd_9jA .</p>  <p>  It is intended to progress this legislation in the months ahead. Submissions from stakeholders will of course be carefully considered in the context of publication of the forthcoming Bill. Details of the proposed reform will be included in the General Scheme when published.</p></reply>

We are confident that the victim-centred policy approach we are taking will encourage more victims to come forward which will, in turn, strengthen prosecutions and convictions.</p><p>The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences and Human Trafficking) Bill 2022, published in July, will put a revised National Referral Mechanism (NRM) on a statutory footing, making it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified, and access support. </p><p>The NRM is the framework through which the State fulfils its obligations to protect and promote the human rights of trafficking victims, working in partnership with civil society. </p><p>The proposed new NRM was approved by Government in May 2021 and is a key component in combatting human trafficking. It will provide for civil society groups that support victims to refer them for formal identification and will make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward and be identified so they can access all of the supports and resources that are available to them. </p><p>This is a clear demonstration of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to identify and support victims of this abhorrent crime and it will strengthen our international reputation in this area.</p><p>I also want to draw the Deputy's attention to the advanced work to develop a new National Action Plan on human trafficking.  </p><p>My Department has engaged with a working group to draft the new National Action Plan high-level goals and outcomes. A draft Action Plan has been prepared and I intend to engage in a further round of stakeholder consultations before the plan is finalised and submitted to Government for approval in Q4 2022.</p><p>Other significant measures introduced in Ireland to combat trafficking, create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training, include -</p><p>- The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline, shipping and security who may come into contact with trafficked persons</p><p>- Increased funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.</p><p>- For the past number of years the Department of Justice has partnered with the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM) office in Dublin on an annual campaign to raise awareness in society that victims of trafficking can be found anywhere and can be hidden in plain sight and we are looking forward to building on this work with IOM.</p><p>The Third National Strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence that I recently launched contains an action to identify linkages between the implementation plan accompanying the Strategy, and the National Action Plan on human trafficking, as well as ensuring actions to prevent prostitution and combat trafficking for sexual exploitation are addressed in an integrated manner.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that a search of the PULSE database was conducted on 22 September 2022 to identify any incident of PULSE category &ldquo;Human Trafficking&rdquo; which includes the following types: </p><p>- Labour Exploitation - Person Other Than A Child</p><p>- Sexual Exploitation - Person Other Than A Child</p><p>- Labour Exploitation Of A Child</p><p>- Sexual Exploitation Of A Child</p><p>- Soliciting or Importuning for Prostitution</p><p>- Other Offences</p><p>- Any incident of PULSE category &lsquo;Miscellaneous&rsquo; and of type &lsquo;Human Trafficking Offences&rsquo;</p><p>I have been advised that the count of unique incidents for the full year 2021 and YTD to 21/09/2022 is as follows:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2021 </th>       <th>2022 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incidents </td>       <td>51 </td>       <td>29 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Information provided is taken from PULSE as of 22 September 2022; it is operational and may be liable to change.

Management of the condition is required across the entire spectrum of healthcare delivery including self-management support as well as care delivered through general practice, community specialist care and hospital inpatient specialist care.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the needs of the diabetes community and the challenges faced by those living with the condition and have recently met with representatives from Diabetes Ireland and the HSE National Clinical Programme for Diabetes to discuss different ways diabetes care can be improved across the country.</p>  <p>  The planned delivery of diabetes services is ongoing, with increases in approved related hospital and community diabetes team posts, the increased number of DAFNE centres, and the recent Government approval for the General Scheme of a Health Information Bill, to facilitate the development of national/population-based disease specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry.  The inclusion of diabetes as one of four chronic diseases in respect of which GMS patients receive ongoing, planned care from their GP through the Chronic Disease Management Programme also represents a major step forward in assisting those living with diabetes to manage their condition.</p></reply>

These are provided through community services known as Community Funded Schemes and play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning, and to remain living in their homes and local community. Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances. Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding availability within local budgets.</p>  <p>  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medical costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  For persons experiencing difficulty paying their electricity costs, financial assistance may be available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) Scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection. Further information on the type of SWA payments available can be found here: www.gov.ie/en/collection/d5554-supplementary-welfare-allowance/. </p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

It is currently working on Reports for the years 2015-2020 to bring them up to date. It hopes to complete these reports by year end, furnishing each report to the Department as available.</p>  <p>  One of the issues for the HSE which has caused delays in the preparation of the S13 Annual Reports, lies in the outdated database it is currently using to facilitate the case management, planning and reporting of assessments and services to children with a disability. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that a National Management Information System for all 91 CDNTs is in development and, when implemented, will provide current data on waiting lists for all CDNTs. In the interim, manual data collection is on-going and will provide information to the local areas regarding the number of children waiting for each CDNT. The contract to develop and rollout CDNTIMS to all 91 CDNTs nationally formally commenced in May 2022. Rollout of the system will commence in Q4 2022 and completion is expected in Q3 2023.</p></reply>

Following consultation, my Department sanctioned additional resources to deal with the backlog. These have been in place for some time now and timelines for processing applications have significantly reduced. </p>  <p>  In 2021 there were 4,546 applications from overseas nurses and midwives and, based on current trends, the NMBI estimates that it will receive just over 5,256applications in 2022.</p>  <p>  So far in 2022, NMBI has issued 4,523 Decision Letters to overseas applicants. This is higher than the number issued during the full year of 2021 (2,430) and NMBI expects to have issued about 5,500 by year-end, which will be more than double the 2021 total. A Decision Letter is a key milestone for applicants and usually ( 98% of cases) includes an instruction for the applicant to go through a &lsquo;compensation measure&rsquo; to allow them to demonstrate their clinical skills in terms of meeting the standard required in Ireland set by NMBI.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 80% of nurses and midwives pass their required compensation measures (either an adaptation period or an aptitude test) and convert to a registrant within six months of their decision letter being issued. Following registration, they can join the nursing and midwifery workforce.</p>  <p>  In the period up to January 2022, 95% of initial applications received by NMBI were incomplete applications. This increases the lead in time for registration as time is lost while individuals gather (and supply to NMBI) the necessary documents and information which had not been supplied initially. As of the end of August 2022, only 55% of applications were incomplete at the point of submission, which is a substantial improvement.</p>  <p>  The NMBI continues to work with key agencies and stakeholders as part of its role in supporting applicants, including aiming to further reduce the number of incomplete applications received.</p>  <p>  In addition to assisting applicants, the NMBI&rsquo;s approach is to reduce the timeframe in responding to incomplete submissions, thereby speeding up the process. Currently, these applications are assessed within 4 days of submission and applications that require re-assessment are reviewed within 5 days of receiving the additional necessary documents or information which had been sought from applicants. Once again this is a significant improvement since January 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the NMBI has a number of statutory obligations to protect the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and to protect the integrity of the practice of the professions of nursing and midwifery. Maintaining a high level of scrutiny in the assessment of applications is an essential element of this protection.</p></reply>

Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding availability within local budgets.</p>  <p>  Currently, many of these aids and appliances are not provided on a standardised basis across the country and many do not yet have formal contracts in place governing their supply or price. This has resulted in an inequality of access for some aids and appliances in some areas. In addition, it does not allow the HSE to deliver best value for money in the provision of these aids and appliances.</p>  <p>  The HSE established a National Service Improvement Programme for the Community Funded Schemes. This Programme is working on the development of standard operating procedures and guidelines with the aim of ensuring value for money, equity of access, and a management system that ensures compliance with those guidelines.</p>  <p>  In respect of the aids and appliances stream, the category lists are completed, category specific information for prescribers is complete and the contracts for Aids and Appliances items are in place. The roll-out and implementation of these lists and prescribing information to CHOs and local health care workers is currently underway and is expected to be completed by November 2022.</p></reply>

The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The DPS threshold was reduced twice in 2022; to &euro;100 per month as of 1 January 2022, and to &euro;80 per month as of 1 March 2022. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card. Since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.</p>  <p>  On 1 November 2020, prescription charges under the GMS scheme were reduced as follows:</p>  <p>  - For persons over 70, the charges were reduced to &euro;1 per item with a maximum monthly charge of &euro;10 per person or family per month.</p>  <p>  - For persons under 70, the charges were reduced to &euro;1.50 per item with a maximum monthly charge of &euro;15 per person or family.</p>  <p>  In addition to this change, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the DPS is deliberately designed as a simple universal non-means tested scheme which is in place to protect those who do not qualify for a medical card from excessive medical costs. There is a process around means testing for medical cards which requires the HSE to consider hardship and inability to pay for required health care when making determinations around eligibility. The introduction of a two-tiered DPS threshold would introduce an element of complexity in that scheme &ndash; including legislative, IT and verification changes &ndash; that is not warranted when there is already a system in place for the HSE to issue discretionary medical cards on hardship grounds.</p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

Whilst the impact of these initiatives was in some cases to push other planned work back, they were nonetheless important and necessary in terms of pandemic response.

There are some sites that already issue discharges electronically - some are simple notifications of discharge whilst others are full discharge notes. Bringing more consistency to the discharge process and associated discharge notes (including clear information on medications) is recognised as a patient safety issue which also enables better continuity of care between the acute and community health settings. Whether 'Healthmail' (which was used to good effect during to pandemic to enable the electronic transfer of prescriptions from GPs to community pharmacy), 'Healthlink' (used for electronic referrals and in many electronic discharge solutions today), or some other technical solution for sending the discharge is not the key issue - the challenge is improving the current discharge process and bringing some consistency to that across all departments in all hospitals before overlaying the technology. If the former is not done first, then we will continue to see inconsistency in terms of the content and layout of information provided when patients are discharged from hospital. The Department will continue to engage with the HSE in relation to this topic, in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare health service reform, better integrated care, patient safety and the eHealth agenda.</p></reply>

Under the GMS contract, GPs are to provide eligible patients with "all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner". While GPs will often be the first point of contact for patients experiencing psychological or mental health difficulties, rather than providing long-term counselling support patients can be referred to dedicated mental health supports.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Counselling Service (NCS) is available free of charge across the country to residents in the Republic of Ireland. The aim of the NCS is to support clients to improve their quality of life and reduce their psychological distress through the provision of evidence-based, professional, client centred counselling.</p>  <p>  The Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) service provides time limited counselling to adult medical card holders experiencing mild to moderate psychological and emotional difficulties such as: depression, anxiety, panic reactions, relationship problems, loss issues, stress. Counselling approaches include person centred, cognitive behavioural, psychodynamic, integrative and supportive therapies. Referral to CIPC is through a GP or local primary care team.</p>  <p>  HSE Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide assessment and treatment for young people and their families who are experiencing mental health difficulties. CAMHS provides specialist mental health treatment delivered through a multidisciplinary team and access is provided through GP referral.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, there are a range of resources available for adults and children with mental health difficulties provided by agencies with the support of the HSE, most of which can be accessed without GP referral.</p></reply>

Currently, the Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in relation to the 2023 Estimates. Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. However, I am committed to ensuring the continued enhancement of mental health services through the allocation of additional funding for mental health in 2023. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to enhancing mental health services, is shown by significant mental health funding increases in recent years. I would note for the Deputy that 2022 saw a record budget for mental health of &euro;1.149 billion, including &euro;24 million for new developments, &euro;10 million for mental health initiatives in response to COVID-19 and &euro;13 million for existing levels of service. </p>  <p>  This Budget, which is the largest mental health budget in the history of the state, is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people.</p>  <p>  The additional once off &euro;10 million for mental health supported the following work. &euro;1m of this was provided for MyMind to continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme has been extended to those affected by the Ukrainian crisis and defective concrete blocks in Donegal and Mayo. &euro;1m was also provided to Mental Health Ireland to manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department for community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Funding allocated to mental health services in recent years has allowed for the continued investment in the mental health national clinical programmes and models of care, which has led to significant service improvements, including the full implementation of specialist perinatal mental health network provided for and the on-going expansion of specialist mental health teams for eating disorders, ADHD in adults, and dual diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Importantly, as budgets increase, we need to ensure that we have plans and strategies in place so that those resources are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of people using our mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.</p></reply>

To increase the number of GPs in Ireland, the Government has provided significant further investment and taken steps to make general practice a more attractive career choice.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022.  The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides dental care free of charge to medical card holders aged 16 and over. In response to concerns that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services, I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. To address the concerns of contractors about the Scheme, I am using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings. The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I would hope that this substantial additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more and more dentists to provide care to medical card patients. The numbers of patients being seen and the numbers of treatments being provided under the DTSS have started to increase in recent months. Patients are also accessing the preventative scale and polish which has been reintroduced, which is a positive development.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for such blood tests.

I am aware of that there are currently significant delays in accessing this service and that the HSE has put in place a number of measures to address waiting times.</p>  <p>  The HSE is developing service improvement initiatives to ensure that all referrals will receive an orthodontic assessment within 6 months and that the number of inappropriate referrals will be reduced.</p>  <p>  Access to orthodontic treatment in another EU jurisdiction is also available under the EU Cross Border Healthcare Directive for patients that are already on an orthodontic treatment waiting list.  Many patients in border areas have accessed care in Northern Ireland through this route pre-Brexit.

Almost 2,000 Irish students aged 15 and 16 years completed the survey in 2019 and it found that 39% of students reported having ever used an e-cigarette with 16% of these reporting using one in the last 30 days.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which is currently being drafted will prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products including disposable e-cigarettes to, and by, persons under 18 years of age. It will also require that any retailer of e-cigarettes must have a licence which must be renewed annually. These measures together are likely to reduce the availability of e-cigarettes to young people.</p>  <p>  The main legislation currently regulating e-cigarettes in Ireland is the EU Tobacco Products Directive which was transposed into Irish law by the EU (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016. The Directive regulates e-cigarette devices, the ingredients of e-cigarettes, the packaging in which e-cigarettes are sold and the marketing of the product. Responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation sits with the Environmental Health Service of the HSE. The Tobacco Products Directive is currently being reviewed as part of Europe's Beating Cancer Plan and discussions to date indicate a strengthening of the Directive in relation to e-cigarettes and novel tobacco products. </p></reply>

It is the PSI&rsquo;s responsibility in the public interest to ensure that Pharmacists as healthcare professionals are competent to practise. The role of a pharmacist is a significant and responsible one, and patients must be assured that pharmacists are capable of providing a safe and effective pharmacy service. </p>  <p>  The PSI operates three routes of recognition/registration depending on where the pharmacy qualification has first been acquired &ndash; the national route, EU route and non-EU (third country qualification recognition - TCQR) route under established processes based in Irish and EU law, and cognisant of obligations emanating from Community Membership, and other legislative frameworks including Equality legislation. Currently, each individual applicant going through the TCQR process has the qualification presented assessed through a defined process, which may/may not include the requirement for completion of a period of adaptation, based on the outcome of the individual&rsquo;s performance in an Equivalence Examination, and conducted on behalf of the PSI by a third party, currently UCC. </p>  <p>  The PSI has recognised that its Third Country route of qualification recognition and registration is complex for applicants and is currently in a process to review it so that it is more streamlined and easier to navigate, with the aim being to have an improved TCQR route in place.  This is a strategic project being progressed as part of the PSI Service Plan for 2022. </p>  <p>  My Department has professionally qualified pharmacists among its staff and does not have plans to appoint a chief pharmaceutical officer at the present time. The matter will be kept under review in the context of wider workforce planning considerations.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is interest currently in discussing the potential post of Chief Pharmaceutical Officer and I have asked my officials in the Medicines, Controlled Drugs and Pharmacy Legislation Unit to engage directly with the Irish Pharmacy Union in the first instance, to offer the IPU an opportunity to outline their position and to listen to their perspective and insights on this matter.</p></reply>

In line with the Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the formal Reimbursement list. Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. The Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS). </p>  <p>  The DPS provides for the refund of the amount by which expenditure on approved prescribed medicines or medical and surgical appliances exceeds a named threshold in any calendar month. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone normally resident in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Some hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medications are available to medical card holders under the GMS scheme, subject to the statutory prescription charge. These same HRT medications are also available under the DPS, which ensures that no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p>  <p>  Progressing women&rsquo;s health is a priority for this government. We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p>  <p>  The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan was launched in March 2022. This Action Plan provides the foundation to address women&rsquo;s whole health and help ensure that action on women&rsquo;s health looks beyond reproductive health to make a real difference to women&rsquo;s lives. For example, on 28th April 2022, I allocated up to &euro;2.5 million of the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to priority areas within the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, including menopause. Six menopause clinics nationwide will be open by end 2022. This is two more than was envisaged at the time of publication.  I am committed to the full implementation of the Women's Health Action Plan 2022-23 and will continue to drive progress in all areas of women's health, including menopause.</p></reply>

Community pharmacy is recognised as the most accessible element of our health service with an unequalled reach in terms of patient contact. Community pharmacists have played a central role in the national vaccination rollout &ndash; the largest ever undertaken by the State.</p>  <p>  The regulations governing the pharmacy fee structure that were made under section 9 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 expired at the end of 2019. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, these regulations had to be replaced by 1 January 2020 in order to maintain a statutory basis for contractor payments and to prescribe the fees payable from that date. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 (Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2019 &ndash; S.I. No. 639 of 2019 &ndash; gave effect to the current pharmacy fees. Any future changes to the pharmacy fee structure will need to be made by regulations under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017. </p>  <p>  During the COVID-19 pandemic the Health Service Executive established a Community Pharmacy Contingency Planning working group with relevant stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, to support the implementation of all COVID-19 support measures. This group &ndash; now called the Community Pharmacy Planning Forum &ndash; had examined the operational and clinical challenges confronting community pharmacists during the COVID-19 emergency and played a key role in resolving them to the benefit of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The work of the Forum has now transitioned to discussing the strategic direction of the community pharmacy profession. This will prove invaluable in the context of future contractual reform. Of course, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services, and provide better value for money.</p></reply>

I met with representative groups from the industry in July and again last week, and discussed the impacts of the high fuel and energy prices on the profitability of fishing, seafood processing and aquaculture sectors. The industry is dealing with the impacts of the Brexit Trade &amp;amp; Co-operation Agreement alongside the current energy challenges. In this context, I have been active over the last number of months in implementing extensive support schemes for the wider seafood sector and coastal communities, in line with the recommendations of the &ldquo;Report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Included in the schemes launched to date is the &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme. This scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the cost of renewable energy generation investments and energy efficiency investments. Similarly, the &euro;25 million Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme offers support for a range of entrepreneurial activities including seafood related activities. A key component of the scheme is support for investment in renewable energy. These supports not only provide investment in seafood enterprises, but also ensure they can remain competitive in the long term and be less exposed to issues within their operating environments. </p>  <p>  I have worked very closely with industry to develop short and longer term supports to assist the wider seafood industry cope with the consequences of Brexit and the circumstances that have affected the industry since then. Since the publication of the Task Force Report, &euro;225m in supports and developmental strategies have been launched which will enable our seafood sector and coastal communities to overcome the significant challenges it faces. </p>  <p>  I have made clear the position that the seafood sector must be supported under any business supports provided in the upcoming Budget and I will continue to monitor and assess the situation over the coming period  and keep all available options under active consideration.</p>  <p>  In respect of the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s Programme to deliver this fund has been submitted to the Commission for consideration and adoption.</p></reply>

There are, however, no changes in respect of such pets entering Ireland from Northern Ireland.</p><p>The additional requirements in respect of each pet travelling, or returning, from Great Britain to Ireland are as follows:</p><p>- they may only enter Ireland through certain Travellers&rsquo; Points of Entry - Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, Rosslare Port, Port of Cork at Ringaskiddy, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport.</p><p>- they must travel with either a health certificate issued by a UK official vet, or an EU pet passport. (EU pet passports issued by Northern Ireland remain valid for EU movement if they have been marked with a sticker by the issuing vet in Northern Ireland). This includes affirmation as to rabies vaccination status.  An EU pet passport that was issued in GB is not valid for travel to the EU, even it was issued before January 2021).</p><p>- Dogs travelling from, or returning from, Great Britain to Ireland require treatment against Echinococcus multilocularis (tapeworm) by a veterinarian 24 to 120 hours (1 to 5 days) before arrival in Ireland.</p><p>The required rabies vaccine is effective for a number of years and a booster is only generally required at least every three years.</p><p>The requirement for dogs to receive treatment against tapeworm plays an important role in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s Echinococcus multilocularis free status.  Removing this requirement for treatment before entry would potentially leave Ireland vulnerable to the introduction of Echinococcus.  </p><p>Since January 2021, the movement of pets between Ireland and Northern Ireland has been covered by the Ireland &ndash; Northern Ireland Protocol, which forms part of the broader EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. Under the Protocol, Northern Ireland is subject to EU Regulation 576/2013 and so is still treated as if it were an EU Member State for the purposes of this Regulation.</p><p>Pet dogs travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland must be microchipped, have a valid rabies vaccination and be accompanied by a valid EU or NI pet passport, or an EU health certificate - as heretofore.</p><p>The EU Commission has issued detailed guidance on this topic, as part of their series of Brexit Readiness Notices.</p><p>The Department has also issued a guidance document for pet travel after Brexit, and will continue to communicate with pet owners regarding the requirements for entering Ireland.

Like any non licensed activities it is important that it is done in such a way that it does not interfere with the licence conditions being met. I understand lop and top or brash is sometimes removed from sites and used as a biomass for wood fuel.  This should only be done on certain sites where the operation will not have any adverse effects on water quality. </p><p>Such operations are not usually set out in the conditions of a felling licence. However, it remains the duty of the person carrying out the activity to ensure that no conditions attached to the felling licence are breached during the course of the operations.</p></reply>

The Libraries Capital Programme was fully allocated at that time and Carlow County Council were advised to consider making an application for funding under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) which is administered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. This funding was established to support sustainable development, through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and other large towns, such as Carlow Town.</p>  <p>  Carlow County Council were also requested to simultaneously progress the project through my department's Four Stage Capital Management Process. This is standard practice for all new library projects, including URDF-funded library projects to ensure that they are technically assessed and comply with the Public Spending Code and the Capital Works Management Framework.</p>  <p>  My Department has been liaising with Carlow County Council in progressing the Presentation Building Regeneration Project through the Four Stage Capital Management Process. My Department issued a Stage 3 Approval letter on 17 August 2022 which authorised Carlow County Council to proceed to tender. The letter also advised the Council to ensure that funding had been confirmed for the project in advance of proceeding to tender.</p></reply>
