The Implementation Group has also developed further actions which build on, and supplement, the original Taskforce recommendations.</p>  <p>  To date, the Implementation Group has made significant progress in identifying and working to mitigate potential barriers to the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan. Quarterly reports on the progress achieved by the Implementation Group are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  The actions completed to date cover a wide range of areas such as legislative issues, policy development and consumer awareness. For example, through the work of the Implementation Group, cooperation between telecommunications operators and local and central government has been strengthened. This is resulting in additional telecommunications infrastructure being deployed more rapidly throughout the country, which in turn is leading to better mobile phone coverage and access to mobile broadband services.</p>  <p>  In addition, Transport Infrastructure Ireland have carried out an extensive ducting programme over the last 18 months which will support the roll-out of fibre infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Other tangible examples of the work of the Taskforce include the introduction of a standardised road-opening charging framework by the Local Authorities. ComReg has also introduced a licensing exemption regime to allow the use of mobile phone repeaters, which will greatly improve mobile phone services for people living in rural areas.</p></reply>

More than &euro;46 million is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2019.</p>  <p>  The CSP transferred to my Department from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in January 2018.  While the primary focus for 2018 was ensuring continuity of service, a review of the programme was considered timely given my Department's role and its policy responsibility for social enterprise and for local development and community development.</p>  <p>  My Department consulted with key stakeholders and CSP supported organisations on the scope of the review in October and November last year.  This consultation helped shape the terms of reference for the review and the procurement of an independent third party to review the programme.  Subject to a successful tender process, I expect a reviewer to be appointed before the end of February.  </p>  <p>  The review will consider how the programme fits with overall Government priorities as well as with my Department&rsquo;s other community programmes and policy objectives, and will help inform decisions on the future shape and structure of the programme.  </p>  <p>  The review will take six months and I expect it will be completed in early Autumn 2019.</p></reply>

The Taskforce, which I now chair, meets every quarter.  The Taskforce includes representatives of all of the key public and private sector stakeholders along the Corridor.</p>  <p>  Three subgroups have been established to support the work of the Taskforce, focusing on infrastructure, enterprise space and communications. These subgroups meet twice each quarter and are currently implementing agreed work programmes. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides co-funding for a dedicated AEC Officer in each of the 10 Local Authorities along the Corridor.  This AEC Officer network is a resource to support the work of the AEC Taskforce and its subgroups, as well as to promote the AEC concept more widely.  </p>  <p>  This year, I have also provided the Western Development Commission with additional funding to strengthen the co-ordination of the AEC initiative.</p>  <p>  There have been significant private sector investment and job announcements along the Atlantic Economic Corridor region in the last twelve months, which reflects the fact that the West of Ireland is an attractive place for employers and investors.  The work of the AEC Taskforce will further highlight the potential of the region for national and international investment.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the oversight of the Regulator transferred to my Department on its establishment in July 2017.</p>  <p>  The general function of the Regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland, in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration. This includes maintaining a public register of charitable organisations operating in Ireland and ensuring their compliance with the Charities Acts. Under the Charities Act, 2009, the Charities Regulator is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing liaison between officials in my Department and the Charities Regulator to review the operation of the legislation to ensure that it is operating effectively. In 2017, on foot of public consultation, the Regulator proposed amendments to the Charities Act 2009 in order to ensure consistency and fairness in the accounting and reporting obligations of charities. </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Regulator to consider these amendments and also to consider whether sections of the 2009 Act which have yet to be enacted require further amendment. This work is at an advanced stage and I intend seeking Government approval in the near future to progress the legislation.</p></reply>

The Fund has been allocated &euro;315m over the period 2019 to 2022, with &euro;55m set aside in my Department's budget for successful projects in 2019.</p><p>I announced the first 18 successful projects under the Fund on the 23rd November which will receive &euro;24.4 million. </p><p>The projects from the Fund, while unlocking a further &euro;11 million in other funding, are ready to commence in 2019.</p><p>Donegal got an RRDF allocation of &euro;1.5m for a successful proposal by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta for the expansion of Gaoth Dobhair Business Park which will deliver an additional 1,725 sq.m. of modern office space for formative businesses.</p><p>I also announced over &euro;1.7m RRDF funding for the restoration, by Donegal County Council, of Swan Park in Buncrana, which was badly damaged by extreme weather in 2017.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Library Capital Programme will invest some &euro;29m in 19 projects, as well as the My Open Library service.  I announced a &euro;1m contribution in May 2018 for the new library for Donegal Town. I understand Donegal County Council expects to complete construction of the library by end-2020.</p><p>My Department recently awarded a grant of &euro;35,000 to erect a mobile phone mast in Malin Beg, Co. Donegal under the Digital Innovation Programme. The funds for this project have been drawn down in full and it is my understanding that work will be completed before the end of quarter 2 of this year.</p><p>In 2018 I provided over &euro;630,000 to County Donegal under the Community Enhancement Programme and 146 community groups have been approved under the programme.</p><p>The Local Action Group responsible for the delivery of the LEADER Programme in County Donegal is allocated a budget of approximately &euro;9.6 million. Over &euro;4.3 million is approved to 104 project promoters. Of this, &euro;474,949 has been allocated to 22 projects in the Gaeltacht areas of the county. This funding will be drawn down as work is completed.</p><p>Other programmes operated by my Department which support Donegal are the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme; Town and Village Renewal Scheme; CLAR; The Walks Scheme and the Local Improvement Scheme<b>.</b></p><p>I refer the Deputy to my Department's website for a full list of projects which give a comprehensive picture of what we are achieving for County Donegal. I look forward to making further announcements in 2019 that will build on our existing schemes to achieve better outcomes for all of those who live in rural areas.</p></reply>

This investment has funded walkways, blueways, trails and other outdoor infrastructural projects around the country.</p>  <p>  My Department also administers the Walks Scheme, which currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 private land-holders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme.  In line with this commitment, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to 4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed this year. </p>  <p>  My Department has also been working with the State Claims Agency in relation to the development of a National Indemnity Scheme to strengthen the protection for landowners in respect of recreational users on private lands. This is a priority for my Department in 2019 and it is my objective that a scheme will be agreed as early as possible this year.</p>  <p>  There has been significant growth in the number of people engaging in outdoor pursuits in recent years, and I want to ensure that the countryside recreation sector can grow in a sustainable way into the future to protect the environment and support rural economies.  This will require the input of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  I believe that Comhairle na Tuaite has a role to play in this regard.  I have been reviewing the functions of Comhairle and I will shortly be issuing a new mandate to the group which will include a focus on sustainable use of the countryside.</p></reply>

The current three-year scheme concludes on 30 June 2019 and the next iteration of the scheme will commence on 1 July 2019.  A total of &euro;16.7m has been allocated under the current scheme to 71 different organisations.</p>  <p>  As with the current scheme, national organisations such as the one in question can apply to be considered for funding, which will be allocated through a competitive process.  This competition was advertised on 12 December 2018 and the closing date for receipt of applications is 31 January. An appraisal of the applications will be conducted by Pobal on behalf of my Department and final recommendations will be sent to my Department for approval.  Applicants will be informed in due course of their success or otherwise in qualifying for funding.        </p>  <p>  The organisation in question was allocated &euro;269,700 over the 36 month period of the current SSNO scheme.  </p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, there was no dedicated funding for this scheme for a number of years due to constraints on public expenditure.  However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country. </p><p>I reintroduced the LIS in September 2017 and allocated a total of &euro;17.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads in 2017.

Final figures in respect of 2018 will not be available until all final returns have been submitted to my Department by the Local Authorities.</p><p>A sum of &euro;10 million has been allocated for the LIS in my Department's 2019 Estimate, and I intend to announce details of the scheme in the coming weeks.  The number and location of roads to benefit from improvement works in 2019 will be a matter for the relevant Local Authority.  However, based on previous figures, I would anticipate that the level of funding available would fund the completion of a further 300 to 400 LIS road projects.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2017 Number of LIS Roads Completed</th><th>2018 Number of LIS Roads Completed</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>20</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>21</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>28</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>164</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>57</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>41</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>16</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>21</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>18</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>18</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>89</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>22</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>21</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>20</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>41</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>16</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>9</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>17</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>23</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>18</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>723</td><td>490</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These actions include progressing major roads projects, reviewing public transport policy, improving access to rural transport links and examining the scope for increased investment in regional roads.</p>  <p>  Progress Reports on the implementation of measures contained in the Action Plan are published twice a year on my Department's website. The most recent, Third Progress Report, which was published in November 2018, outlines the progress on all actions due for delivery in the first half of 2018, or which are being implemented on an ongoing basis over the course of the three year Action Plan. It would be a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to provide the Deputy with more recent updates on the status of specific actions relating to the transport. </p>  <p>  My own Department provides funding to Local Authorities for the Local Improvement Scheme to carry out works on private or non-public roads in predominantly rural areas. Over 1,200 roads have benefitted from investment by my Department of over &euro;35 million under the Local Improvement Scheme since 2017.</p>  <p>  The LIS was previously funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but due to constraints on the public finances, no specific funding was ring-fenced for the scheme for a number years prior to my Department re-launching it in 2017.  There is, therefore, a huge built-up demand for the scheme in rural areas.  </p>  <p>  In this context, I wrote to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in February 2018 enquiring if his Department could provide match funding for the LIS to help meet the demand.  However, the Minister's 2018 budget had already been allocated with a focus on funding for regional and local roads under the charge of the Local Authorities.  </p>  <p>  I was later in a position to re-allocate savings from elsewhere in my Department's Vote to the LIS in the second half of 2018 and will continue to fund the scheme in 2019 through my Department's Vote.</p></reply>

The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  I have initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R in the future.  </p>  <p>  The review process began in November last with a targeted consultation meeting with a number of experts who are recognised for their background in rural development issues.  A more detailed  focus group consultation will be held in the coming weeks which will help to inform the next steps in the review process.</p>  <p>  I envisage that a wider stakeholder consultation will also take place before the review is completed.  Once completed, the review will help to inform the design of future CL&Aacute;R programmes. </p></reply>

The general function of the Regulator is to regulate charitable organisations operating in Ireland, in order to increase public trust and confidence in their management and administration. Under the 2009 Act, the Charities Regulator is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions. </p><p>Under the current Act, certain bodies are excluded from being registered Irish charities. The list of excluded bodies set out in section 2(1) of the Charities Act 2009, includes: a political party; a body that promotes a political party or candidate; and a body that promotes a political cause that does not relate directly to the advancement of the body&rsquo;s charitable purpose.</p><p>A registered charity may engage in activities to promote a political cause provided that the promotion of this cause: </p><p>- relates directly to the advancement of the charity&rsquo;s charitable purpose;</p><p>- does not promote a political party or candidate;</p><p>- is not contrary to the charity&rsquo;s governing document.</p><p>The Charities Regulator published a guidance document in February 2018 to assist charities in this regard. The document contains a number of illustrative examples to show how charities can promote political causes as part of their work to advance their charitable purpose.  It also provides examples of the kinds of situations in which charities could potentially find themselves in breach of their legal obligations by engaging in certain political activities. </p><p>The &lsquo;Guidance on Charities and the Promotion of Political Causes&rsquo; is available on the Charities Regulator website www.charitiesregulator.ie </p><p>There is ongoing liaison between officials in my Department and the Charities Regulator to review the operation of the legislation to ensure that it is operating effectively.While my Department is currently working with the Regulator on proposed amendments to the Act, there are no plans currently to amend the section concerned.  </p></reply>

The findings focused in particular on the administration of the fund, the low level of disbursements from the fund and whether money in the fund could be better applied. </p>  <p>  Since then my Department has worked to ensure these issues are addressed and the money in the fund is put to good use. </p>  <p>  As recommended by the C&amp;AG a review of the operation of the disbursement scheme was completed and published by my Department in July 2018. The review sets out 15 recommendations to improve the administration and operation of the Fund. An interdepartmental group has been established to assist in ensuring the recommendations are progressed. </p>  <p>  The 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan was also published in July 2018, and approved funding of up to &euro;39.7 million for 45 different measures across ten different Government Departments. In line with the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Acts, the measures identified in the Action Plan target social, economic and educational disadvantage; and people with a disability. The approved measures will support a wide range of projects and programmes relating to issues such as social inclusion, assisting migrants, support for carers, speech and language therapy, support for dementia sufferers and sports measures. The majority of measures will commence in 2019, subject to voted expenditure being available within each relevant Department.  </p>  <p>  Good progress is being made and spend from the fund across all Departments totalled &euro;27.8 million in 2018. This is an increase of 78% on the 2017 spend of &euro;15.6 million. My own Department fully utilised its allocation - with &euro;10.1 million spent from the fund in 2018. </p></reply>

This funding is used to support training for PPNs, CPD (Continuous Professional Development) events arranged specifically for Resource Workers, training of local authority staff dealing with PPNs, technical and on-going support for the PPN&rsquo;s national database, production of an Annual Report, the costs associated with holding the Annual PPN Conference and other associated costs arising in association with the National PPN Advisory Group. </p>  <p>  One of the recommendations contained in the latest Annual Report and addressed at the 2018 PPN Conference was the need for extra administrative resources to support the PPN development role. Additional funding has been provided by my Department which will enable PPNs to employ a Support Worker in 2019 specifically to provide that extra administrative support.</p>  <p>  Additional recommendations relating to promoting public awareness and understanding of the PPNs, to be developed through a Communications Strategy along with a review of the PPN Guidelines, will also be supported by my Department in 2019.  </p></reply>

The aim of CL&Aacute;R is to support the sustainable development of designated CL&Aacute;R areas with the aim of encouraging people to continue to live and work in those areas. The funding provided under CL&Aacute;R works in conjunction with local funding and on the basis of locally identified priorities.</p>  <p>  CL&Aacute;R was originally launched in October 2001 to provide for targeted investment in disadvantaged rural areas. The areas originally selected for inclusion in the programme were those which suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 1996.  The Cooley Peninsula was also included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by Foot and Mouth disease. The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.</p>  <p>  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 Census data was carried out by the NIRSA Institute at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.  However, I re-launched the programme in the second half of 2016, using as a base-line the areas identified in the work carried out by NIRSA.  Over 1,200 projects have been approved for funding of &euro;25 million under CL&Aacute;R since I re-launched the programme in 2016. </p>  <p>  I have recently initiated a review of the CL&Aacute;R programme which will examine CL&Aacute;R areas by reference to the 2016 Census of Population data.  It will also consider whether there are any other factors that should be taken into account in designating areas for eligibility under CL&Aacute;R.  The review, once completed, will also help to inform future CL&Aacute;R programmes. </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the specific measures to be supported under the  CL&Aacute;R programme this year will be made shortly and I anticipate that the 2019 CL&Aacute;R Programme will be opened for new applications in the first quarter of the year. </p></reply>

Those programmes include the LEADER Programme; the Social Inclusion and the Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO), the Seniors Alert Scheme (SAS), the Community Services Programme (CSP). In addition, Pobal is responsible for the management and administration of the Social Enterprise Measure of the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) on behalf of the Department.        </p>  <p>  Each programme that Pobal provides supports for differs, as does Pobal&rsquo;s level and type of involvement in each.  Pobal&rsquo;s role depends on the requirements of the division with responsibility for the respective programme and does not involve the allocation of funding on behalf of my Department in all cases. For example, in some cases Pobal will work across the programme lifecycle as with SICAP. Pobal does not allocate SICAP funding which is done directly by the Department through the Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  Pobal supports to the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme are for ICT and Pobal also undertake certain Article 48 checks under the programme. Pobal has no function in the allocation of funding to individual LEADER project promoters. The responsibility for allocating funding under the LEADER Programme rests with the relevant Local Action Groups.</p>  <p>  As referenced above, Pobal manages the Community Services Programme on behalf of my Department. As part of this process, recommendations are made to the Department following evaluation of applications received on the allocation of funding.  The overall responsibility for decision making under this, and all other programmes Pobal has a role in, rests with my Department.  </p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Army, there is ongoing investment in force protection, transport, communications and information technology, weapons and ammunition.  Twenty four (24) 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in late 2017 and in 2018 the Defence Forces took delivery of ten (10) new armoured logistic vehicles. A significant investment is being made in the Army&rsquo;s fleet of MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers. A multi-year mid-life upgrade programme is underway at a cost of &euro;55m plus VAT which will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. The first twenty (20) upgraded vehicles were recently delivered. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces fleet of armoured and non-armoured vehicles is subject to regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements both at home and overseas. In this regard a requirement for additional 4x4 armoured utility vehicles has been identified and subject to consideration of a business case and assessment of associated cost, funding will be made available. At this time there are no plans for the purchase of additional armoured logistic vehicles for the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. </p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aims to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international election observation missions. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>  <p>  A new roster of volunteer international election observers was put in place in January 2019. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received 395 applications, allowing a roster of 201 members to be mustered, similar to the number of volunteers mustered under the previous roster.  The level of interest meant that there was intense competition for the available places.  To ensure a fair process, a booklet was made available detailing the elements which applicants were expected to demonstrate in completing their written applications.  Assessment at this stage was subject to independent calibration and quality assurance from an external agency.  </p>  <p>  Eight adjudication panels were established, chaired by retired officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, of Ambassadorial rank and who, during their career, had demonstrated extensive experience of human rights, democratisation and the rule of law overseas. </p>  <p>  While I am confident that the high level of interest will help ensure the quality of Irish election observers remains high, with nearly twice as many applicants as available places, regrettably not all of those willing to volunteer could be selected. </p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness, an appeal mechanism was available.  Less than one fifth of the unsuccessful candidates sought a formal review by way of appeal. On the basis of the grounds submitted by each candidate, about half of the review requests were accepted and referred to an Appeals Panel. That Appeals Panel has yet to finish its deliberations.  </p>  <p>  As was made clear to all potential volunteers in the Volunteer Information Booklet which set out the requirements expected, all candidates were required to provide at least one relevant example under each of five competencies, as part of a competency based assessment.  Provided that a candidate with prior international election observation experience, or, indeed, any other relevant experience, demonstrated through the examples provided in their application form that they possessed the competencies under assessment, such experience was fully considered in the marking process. </p>  <p>  Although the Volunteer Information Booklet did not specify that particular qualifications were essential or desirable, a small proportion of marks were awarded for the specific skills and experiences which were listed as desirable in the Volunteer Information Booklet. </p>  <p>  In the event of any candidate requesting reasonable accommodation for a disability at the time of application, such a request would have been given full and thorough consideration. No candidate requested any particular arrangement at the time of applying, and no candidate contacted the Department at any stage of the process prior to the appeals stage to ask whether particular arrangements could be made. The Appeals Panel cannot consider new information which was not provided at the time of application, to do so would not be fair to all candidates in the process.</p></reply>

Funding has been earmarked for the Passport Service, and to support essential reconciliation work being carried out by civil society in Northern Ireland and across the island of Ireland, and North-South cooperation.</p>  <p>  One area of my Department that has been particularly impacted by the prospect of Brexit is the Passport Service, which closely monitors the volume of applications on an ongoing basis to ensure that resources are available to meet the demand.</p>  <p>  My Department has strengthened the capacity of the Passport Service by recruiting additional permanent staff over the past twelve months to respond to the general increase in passport applications.</p>  <p>  The normal seasonal intake of Temporary Clerical Officers has already commenced, and in the coming months, it is hoped that over 150 Temporary Clerical Officers will be assigned to the processing of applications.

We will therefore continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress &ndash; both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens; and in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented in order to regularise their status. </p>  <p>  Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, John Deasy T.D., has worked closely on these issues with Ireland's Ambassador to the US, Dan Mulhall, and his team at the Embassy in Washington DC.  I know that their commitment to, and engagement on, these issues will continue undiminished. </p>  <p>  I look forward to visiting the US in February, for a series of engagements with the US Administration and Congressional leaders on the full range of issues of mutual interest. I will raise immigration issues in these meetings, as I have done in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders since taking office. </p>  <p>  Likewise, over the St Patrick's Day period, the Taoiseach will have a range of engagements at the highest levels of the US Administration and Congress. He too will raise immigration issues, building on the work of my Department and in particular the continued engagement on this matter from our Embassy in Washington, D.C., together with Special Envoy Deasy.</p>  <p>  I would also note that our Embassy and the Consulates in America will continue to support the Irish Immigration Centres in their work. Each Centre receives significant Government funding through the Emigrant Support Programme each year for its work, including its support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. In 2018, over $3,700,000 was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including many organisations that provide frontline welfare support and services to undocumented Irish.</p></reply>

A list of the Statutory Instruments (S.I.s) giving Ministerial approval for these transfers is detailed below.  In my time as Minister for Finance, I have received two requests seeking my approval to transfer a banking business. Both were made in the context of the Brexit preparations of the banks involved. Upon review of the proposals, and consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank on the relevant regulatory, supervisory and prudential considerations, I gave my approval to both bank transfers. </p><p>A key consideration when reviewing proposals to transfer banking business is that in promoting the industry it is important that there is fair entry to and exit from the financial services sector in Ireland, and the Government has no desire to cause undue difficulty to firms wishing to enter or withdraw from the market. Moreover, we recognise that mergers and acquisitions play an important role in the growth of firms, and transfers of banking business often take place in such a context. Also, as banks with a global footprint enter the Irish market using branch or subsidiary structures, when there is a restructuring at group level, it may be necessary for the bank to transfer its business internally from one part of the group to another. This is particularly the case in light of Brexit, where the Irish authorised bank may be a branch of the group's UK bank and transfers its Irish business to become a branch of another European bank within the group structure. </p><p>It is not in the spirit of the legislation to prohibit any transfer of banking business, unless there were serious concerns about the regulatory or prudential impact of a proposed transfer, or it would be likely to have a significant negative impact on the Irish economy or financial stability.</p><p><b>Statutory Instruments made under Section 33 of the Central Bank Act 1971 (as amended)</b></p><p>1.

However, a Revenue Commissioners concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  Revenue has since decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted. Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licenced by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated.</p></reply>

This represents an APR of 12.68%. </p>  <p>  In a Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) Policy Paper published in December 2017, the CUAC recommended that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month. This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings. The CUAC came to this recommendation following a survey of the credit union sector with responses from 117 credit unions.</p>  <p>  The CUAC Implementation Group considered this recommendation and agreed in principle to recommend that the Minister raise the interest rate ceiling to 2% per month and for flexibility to be introduced to allow the interest rate to be amended in future by Statutory Instrument following consultation with the Central Bank and CUAC. </p>  <p>  Introducing this recommended change to the interest rate cap requires primary legislation to amend section 38 1(a) of the Credit Union Act 1997. I have therefore asked my officials to begin preparations for this legislative change to the interest rate cap which will shortly be brought forward through the normal legislative process, subject to Cabinet approval. </p></reply>

There are therefore two applicants under the newly designed scheme:</p><p>1. The company will give the investor a &ldquo;statement of qualification&rdquo;, attesting to the fact that the company meets the company conditions.  That statement is treated as a tax return filed with Revenue.  </p><p>2. Having received a &ldquo;statement of qualification&rdquo;, the investor then claims the relief from Revenue.</p><p>If that statement of qualification is incorrect, penalties can apply to it as they can apply to a tax return filed by the company.  If the investor makes an incorrect claim for relief, other than because they were given an incorrect statement of qualification, then penalties may arise.</p><p>Section 508U of the TCA (as amended by Finance Act 2018) provides that in circumstances whereby the investor could not have known that the company was not a qualifying company, the withdrawal of the relief will occur by the making of an assessment against the qualifying company. The liability will fall to the company not the investor.</p><p>Section 508V provides in circumstances whereby the investor could or would have known that the company was not a qualifying company, the withdrawal of the relief will occur by the making of an assessment against the investor. The liability will fall to the investor.</p><p>Section 1077E sets out penalties for deliberately or carelessly making incorrect returns or failing to make returns.</p><p>- Section 1077E (2) provides that where a person deliberately makes an incorrect return, declaration, claim, statement or accounts to Revenue, that person will be liable to a penalty.  The maximum penalty for tax defaults under this subsection is 100% of the tax underpaid.</p><p>- Section 1077E (5) provides that where a person carelessly, but not deliberately, delivers an incorrect return, makes an incorrect statement, claim or declaration or submits incorrect accounts, that person will be liable to a penalty.  The maximum penalty for tax defaults under this subsection is 40% of the tax underpaid, or 20% of the tax underpaid if the underpayment is 15% or less of the person&rsquo;s overall liability to tax for the period.  </p><p>In both cases the penalty shall be mitigated if the person who made the incorrect return, declaration, claim, statement or accounts co-operates with Revenue and/or makes a prompted or unprompted qualifying disclosure.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that reviews of both the &ldquo;statement of qualification&rdquo; and the individual&rsquo;s claim for relief will be carried out in accordance with the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions.

This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis.  The Public Spending Code is supplemented in some instances by sectoral specific appraisal guidance. These are developed by the relevant Department and set out additional requirements and parameters specific to the sector, while remaining in the line with the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The Public Spending Code requires that Sponsoring Agencies, i.e. those that are responsible for delivering projects, prepare an economic appraisal such as a cost benefit analysis or a cost effectiveness analysis for current and/or capital expenditure projects or programmes which cost over &euro;20 million before the relevant Sanctioning Authority, i.e. usually the body providing the funding, makes a decision on whether to approve the project. The Public Spending Code also requires that the economic appraisal is submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for technical review. The purpose of the technical review is to support consistency in the application of the Public Spending Code guidance.</p><p>The Public Spending Code requirements do not prohibit Sponsoring Agencies from conducting cost benefit analysis on projects costing less than &euro;20 million. The Public Spending Code guidance stresses the need for proportionality in appraisal and for Sponsoring Agencies to choose the appraisal methodology that is most appropriate for assessing the value for money of a project or programme.</p><p>Responsibility for complying with the requirements of the Public Spending Code including on appraisal is a matter for each Sponsoring Agency and Sanctioning Authority.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not see all cost benefit analyses conducted by each Sponsoring Agency and does not collect statistics on numbers of appraisals.  </p><p>The Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker will, going forward, capture information on projects at each stage of the project life cycle. The tracker is published at . This will provide additional information on the appraisal of capital projects in the National Development Plan.</p><p>The newly established Investment Projects and Programmes Office (IPPO) in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform will play an important role in strengthening the appraisal and evaluation of investment projects and programmes. A review of the Public Spending Code is underway. The IPPO is updating the capital appraisal guidelines in the Public Spending Code.

This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies including cost benefit analysis.  The Public Spending Code is supplemented in some instances by sectoral specific appraisal guidance. These are developed by the relevant Department and set out additional requirements and parameters specific to the sector, while remaining in the line with the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The Public Spending Code requires that Sponsoring Agencies, i.e. those that are responsible for delivering projects, prepare an economic appraisal such as a cost benefit analysis or a cost effectiveness analysis for current and/or capital expenditure projects or programmes which cost over &euro;20 million before the relevant Sanctioning Authority, i.e. usually the body providing the funding, makes a decision on whether to approve the project. The Public Spending Code also requires that the economic appraisal is submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for technical review. The purpose of the technical review is to support consistency in the application of the Public Spending Code guidance.</p><p>The Public Spending Code requirements do not prohibit Sponsoring Agencies from conducting cost benefit analysis on projects costing less than &euro;20 million. The Public Spending Code guidance stresses the need for proportionately in appraisal and for Sponsoring Agencies to choose the appraisal methodology that is most appropriate for assessing the value for money of a project or programme.</p><p>Responsibility for complying with the requirements of the Public Spending Code including on appraisal is a matter for each Sponsoring Agency and Sanctioning Authority.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not see all cost benefit analyses conducted by each Sponsoring Agency and does not collect statistics on numbers of appraisals or length of time to conduct and process appraisals.  Each Government Department is required to prepare an annual Quality Assurance Report on how it is meeting its Public Spending Code obligations. Part of this obligation includes regular in-depth checks of a sample of projects and programmes to monitor the quality of the appraisal and assess the appraisal process.</p><p>The Project Ireland 2040 Capital Tracker will, going forward, capture information on projects at each stage of the project life cycle. The tracker is published at . This will provide additional information on the appraisal of capital projects in the National Development Plan.</p><p>The newly established Investment Projects and Programmes Office (IPPO) in the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform will play an important role in strengthening the appraisal and evaluation of investment projects and programmes. A review of the Public Spending Code is underway. The IPPO is updating the capital appraisal guidelines in the Public Spending Code.

Desk-top review of recently published research/studies in this area.</p><p>2. Consultations with key individuals and organisations who have responsibility for or who are working in this area.</p><p>3. Working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in schools and in class rooms.</p><p>A review of research was commissioned in June 2018 and a report was published in November.  </p><p>A number of consultative events are being planned.  The first was held on 27 November at Collins Barracks, Dublin and involved approximately 60 groups and organisations who have expressed an interest in or who are known to have an interest in contributing to the review. </p><p>Approximately 20 primary and post primary schools, representing a range of school types and experiences will be directly involved.  The outcome from this strand of the review will inform recommendations in relation to the reality of the experience of RSE in classrooms and the experience of parents, curriculum gaps, implementation barriers and enablers, and support needs. Furthermore, there will be an opportunity for any school to be involved, should they wish, to facilitate workshops locally.</p><p>The timelines for the three dimensions of the review are likely to intersect somewhat but will also contribute and add to the progression of the review The NCCA intend to publish a draft report on the Review of RSE, which will be subject to further consultation from stakeholders. I expect a final report in Q2 2019.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new 500 pupil post-primary school for Enfield (located in the Kilcock school planning area) to be established in 2020. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. </p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has recently announced the expansion of the existing Curragh Post-Primary School with a new 1,000 pupil school building. It is intended that the expansion of the existing Curragh post-Primary school, a multi-denominational Community College under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB), will also cater for demand arising in the adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department's Capital Programme continues to address the challenges posed by the significant bulge in pupil enrolments going through our schools. This has seen a significant expansion in the rate of provision of new school places.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the current status of large-scale projects, including those in County Kildare, being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website, www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Under the 2016-2017, almost &euro;117 million has been approved to date under the Summer Works Scheme, in respect of over 940 school projects in categories 1 - 9.  Details of the successful school applicants are published on my Department's website www.education.ie</p>  <p>  With regard to the remaining applications under Category 10, which relate to external works such as upgrading and resurfacing of playgrounds and car parking, these applications require more detailed analysis. It is intended to undertake this analysis shortly with a view to enabling approved applications to proceed in 2020.</p>  <p>  The recent launch of Project Ireland 2040 included an announcement of a major package of investment in education for the next decade with the school building budget increasing by 70%.  This investment will provide for the continued increase in demographics while also allowing for a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrading of existing school stock.  In this regard, I wish to advise the Deputy that I am committed to a new Summer Works Scheme which will open for applications in the coming months for projects to be delivered from Summer 2020.</p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p><p>In terms of investment in the Garda estate, the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by over &euro;60 million Exchequer funding as well as a major Public Private Partnership (PPP).  There has been some good progress on the programme in 2018, as well as in other major projects in relation to the Garda estate, including in particular completion and entry into operational use of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street Dublin, which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p><p>The Public Private Partnership<b></b>arrangement included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme is intended to deliver new stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo as well as a new custody suite at the Garda Station at Anglesea Street Cork.</p><p>I am informed by the OPW and the Garda authorities that the OPW has acquired sites for the development of the new stations in Macroom and Sligo. The site in Clonmel is a portion of the former Kickham Barracks and has at all material times been in state ownership.  Having previously been transferred from the Department of Defence to Tipperary County Council, I am informed by the OPW that the difficulty in relation to completion of transfer of the site from Tipperary County Council to the OPW has been resolved and that the transfer is now being finalised.  On completion, ownership of all three sites will be vested in the OPW. </p><p>The Deputy raised the question of costs incurred to date in relation to Clonmel. I am informed by the OPW that conveyance of the site is being handled by the CSSO.  The site is being transferred from the Council to the OPW free gratis, and in parallel a separate portion of land is being transferred free gratis from the OPW to the Council.  I am further informed by the OPW that minor costs have been incurred to date for the purpose of site surveys.  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that no additional costs have yet been incurred although costs will arise as the project progresses. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).My Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing to engage with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.</p></reply>

These Inquiries arose out of the recommendations of the Independent Review Mechanism, in respect of complaints considered by it. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Attorney General, it was decided that it would be appropriate for these Inquiries to be conducted by retired members of the judiciary. The Attorney General  put forward nominations of appropriate persons and my predecessor, Minister Frances Fitzgerald TD, made the five appointments.   </p>  <p>  A distinguished retired judge of the District Court was appointed to conduct the Inquiry relating to complaints made by the person referred to by the Deputy.  The former judge had previously held the position of Garda Confidential Recipient for a relatively brief period from 12th March 2014 to 14th July 2014 when the office was abolished.   </p>  <p>  In advance of assigning a particular case to each of the former judges, assurance was sought by my Department and provided by the judges that they had no previous professional involvement with the cases to be inquired into, nor was there any other reason which could give rise to a conflict of interest. In the event that a judge felt that there could be cause for a potential conflict of interest in relation to one or more of the five cases, those cases were assigned to a different judge. </p>  <p>  I am fully satisfied as to the appropriateness of his subsequent appointment to Inquire into the matter raised in the Deputy's question.</p></reply>

It is completely unacceptable that crimes were not properly pursued in many cases. This situation must be thoroughly addressed, not only for the victims and the proper administration of Justice, but also for the future welfare of children who may have committed crimes. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has indicated that disciplinary investigations will be considered by Divisional Officers in relation to individual members. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter for the Commissioner and his management team and any process of that kind has to be allowed to take its course and cannot be pre-judged. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have taken a number of technical and organisational steps to prevent recurrence of the failures identified. While there have been significant improvements, there is more to be done to achieve a comprehensive solution. The Commissioner has also established a National Bureau for Child Diversion to improve future management of this whole area. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority, which was established to provide independent oversight of policing, has indicated that it will follow through with further detailed examination of this matter and the actions being taken by the Commissioner. I will also continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  The issues in question relate to youth crime cases deemed unsuitable for the Garda Diversion Programme. Therefore, it is important to recognise that there are no negative implications for the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme itself, which has been in operation successfully for many years, helping young offenders turn away from crime.</p>  <p>  The specific details by Garda Division referred to by the Deputy have been requested from the Garda authorities, and I will contact the Deputy directly when a response is to hand.</p></reply>

The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p>  <p>  With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.

An adrenaline auto-injector (Epipen) is a prescription-only medicine that ordinarily can only be supplied on foot of a prescription. There is nothing to prevent a person with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis who has been prescribed an Epipen from carrying their prescribed medication with then at all times. This is particularly important for persons at risk of an acute anaphylactic attack.</p>  <p>  Medicines legislation, permits any person to administer any medicine to another person in accordance with the directions of a registered medical practitioner. Therefore, if a person has been prescribed a medicine, but is unable to administer it to themselves, such as in the case of an overdose, there is no legal impediment to another person administering that medicine to the patient. {Regulation 4A(1)(c) of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended) (S.I. No. 540 of 2003)] </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these provisions, S. I. No.  449 of 2015 amended the Prescription Regulations to allow certain prescription-only medicines, including adrenaline for known or suspected anaphylaxis, to be administered by trained members of the public in emergency situations. In order for an organisation, which can include schools, workplaces and other public places, to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, members of that organisation must complete an approved course of training regarding the administration of such medicines and the management of any adverse reaction. The Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) has established a framework for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer this medicine to those urgently requiring care.</p></reply>

In addition, the Commission recommended that eligibility requirements for Senior Staff Nurse /Midwife be reduced from 20 to 17 years.</p>  <p>  With regard to new entrant pay, the Government has made proposals to address this issue which will benefit approximately 10,000 nurses to the value of around &euro;3,000 each. </p>  <p>  It is clear that these measures would improve the overall pay package for the majority of nurses and midwives.  They show that the Public Service Stability Agreement and the related negotiation process are delivering significant improvements for nurses.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the current dispute, what is being sought is in effect a pay increase to the value of approximately 12%.  Both unions are signed up to the Public Service Stability Agreement, which precludes pay claims and commits the parties to maintaining industrial peace.  Any resolution will need to be within the parameters of the PSSA.  </p>  <p>  Despite a number of engagements between health sector management and the INMO and PNA, it has not been possible to make progress.  The unions have now referred the dispute to the WRC Conciliation Services.  The WRC engagement is scheduled to commence on 23 January and management will attend.  There still remains time to reach an agreement which could avert this dispute and I would urge the parties to continue to engage. </p></reply>

I am satisfied that there are sufficient fishing opportunities for these vessels outside of six nautical miles.  I also believe that these actions will provide wider ecosystem benefits, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks. I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for those fishermen and I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.</p><p>I am also mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and the sea angling sectors, which the Government has committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>I also announced that there will be a transition period to 2022 for vessels over 18 metres targeting sprat. This transition is in order to allow a period of adjustment for these vessels, as this fishery is concentrated inside the 6 nautical mile zone. I have asked BIM to offer affected vessel owners technical assistance to adjust to other fisheries during the transition process.</p><p>Vessels over 18 metres  will continue to be permitted inside 6 nautical miles to trawl for sprat only until 2022. A total allowable catch of up to 2,000 tonnes, reflecting a reduction on recent years, will be permitted for these vessels during 2020, reducing to 1,000 tonnes in 2021. All trawling activity by vessels over 18 metres vessels for sprat, inside the 6 mile limit, will end from the beginning of 2022.  <b></b></p><p>The exclusion applies to trawling by vessels over 18 metres inside 6 nautical miles only.  The reports prepared and the consultation paper did not examine other fishing activities such as dredging.  In referring to mussel dredgers, I understand that the Deputy is referring to the activity of fishing for mussel seed which is gathered from wild seed beds and subsequently relaid on seabed farms on behalf of aquaculture operators for on-growing to marketable size.  Mussel seed fishing is already subject to a number of restrictions including prior authorisation, amounts which may be taken, limits on the fishing season and specific curtailments in the case of Natura 2000 conservation sites.</p></reply>

This is an average of 20 inspections per factory per year, which significantly exceeds the legal minimum requirement of 8 inspections per year. </p>  <p>  At each inspection an average of 85 carcasses were inspected for correct classification and carcase presentation. The legal minimum requirement is 40 carcasses per inspection.</p>  <p>  The weighing of a carcase is governed by SI 363/2010. It states that the factory shall check and record the accuracy of the weighing scales used for the purposes of weighing a carcase if requested by an authorised officer. For the purposes of determining the accuracy of its weighing scales the factory must possess a set of calibrated weights, totalling not less than 260 kg in weight. These calibrated weights are used by an authorised officer to determine the accuracy of the scales at each inspection. These inspections are in addition to the daily scales checks that each factory conducts before production.</p>  <p>  There were no issues regarding weighing systems discovered at inspections from 2016 &ndash; 2018.</p></reply>

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. These proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP 2021-27.  </p>  <p>  Consideration of the CAP proposals is ongoing at EU level.  Since the legislative proposals were launched in June 2018 a total of 25 Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian Presidency.    The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  In addition, CAP post 2020 is also a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.  </p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency outlined an equally intensive programme of Working Group meetings to discuss specific aspects of the CAP proposals for the duration of their Presidency.  I will have a further opportunity to discuss the proposals at the upcoming Agri-Fish Council on Monday 28 January.  </p>  <p>  I have always sought to have a broad consultation on these proposals.  In February 2018, I launched my Department's public consultation process which included six meetings with stakeholders across the country.  In addition, I hosted a Conference in July 2018 on the new CAP legislative proposals for interested stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. The outcome from the consultation process and the stakeholder conference is feeding into the Department&rsquo;s on-going analysis and policy response to the proposals.  </p>  <p>  This was a timely opportunity to bring all interested stakeholders together for a constructive discussion on the future CAP. The range of speakers came from the political sphere, from the European Commission, and from my Department.  The conference was a very useful opportunity to hear the views of the many stakeholders involved.</p>  <p>  Since then there have been ongoing informal consultations with stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. The new delivery model requires Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan to the Commission for approval before the deadline of 1 January 2020 covering Pillar I and Pillar II expenditure.   The CAP Strategic Plan will allow Member States the flexibility to design measures that are best suited to their own strategic needs within parameters laid down in Council Regulations.   </p>  <p>  My Department is working towards the 1 January 2020 deadline. The process of developing the draft Cap Strategic Plan will be a complex process, involving a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design, ex ante evaluation including a Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment.  The establishment of a Monitoring Committee including representatives from the key stakeholders, relevant Government Departments and agencies and the EU Commission is a requirement under the current draft proposals. The Committee will oversee progress on the implementation of schemes in the current Rural Development Programme (RDP)  and will continue to have a role in the next programming period.</p>  <p>  I am open to working with the new delivery model and welcome the move to a more strategic performance based approach.  This new framework must be based on system which provides simplification for all. The new CAP proposals will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  The negotiations for the CAP post 2020 are still ongoing and I will continue to seek to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

My officials are working closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies across the public service to develop a joint approach in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on products coming from the UK. In July 2018, and again in September 2018, a number of decisions were made at Cabinet relating to Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, including the phased recruitment of staff, as required. The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>   The aforementioned requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department has carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, together with close consultation with stakeholder organisations and individual companies, to establish as best we can the likely volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This has been a difficult exercise, given the lack of detailed data as a result of the UK&rsquo;s participation in the Single Market up to this point, but we have based our assumptions and planning on what we believe are reasonable estimates of the likely volumes.</p>  <p>   On staffing, we have used this data analysis exercise to guide our planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required to carry out the range of controls needed. These controls are carried out by a combination of portal inspectorate staff and where necessary, the appropriate veterinary and technical supervision, as well as administrative staff not located at the ports. The Department is working very effectively with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls.  </p>  <p>   In general, the Department will look to recruit and redeploy as well as engage temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. Veterinary supervision will be provided with respect to products of animal origin by a combination of: veterinary inspectors currently on recruitment panels,  where we are in the process of engaging with 37 remaining on current panels; new recruitment competitions; redeployment within the department on a temporary basis if necessary and the possible engagement of contracted service arrangements as required.</p>  <p>   The Department is also drawing from a pool of applicants for Portal Inspector posts and from redeployed volunteers from within the Department to conduct some of the necessary checks. Candidates for these roles will be interviewed in February to provide capacity in Dublin Port and Rosslare for the engagement of 70 Clerical Portal Inspectors, and a significant pool of additional applicants is available for interview as needed.</p>  <p>   The Department can also draw from a pool of applicants for Technical Agricultural Officers for plant health checks. The Department continue to engage with PAS re the aforementioned options as well as other required grades such as Assistant Agricultural Officers as well as back up administrative staff in traditional administrative civil service grades.</p>  <p>   Overall, I am confident that the state will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 identifies competitiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed by my Department and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. The loans will be competitively priced and will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p>  <p>  The fund is leveraged by exchequer funding of &euro;62 million, of which 40% or some &euro;25million has been provided by my Department. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has just issued an open call inviting banks and other lenders to take part. The Scheme will run for three years from its launch date and further announcements in this regard will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Grant aid for capital investments, including a wide variety of on farm investment items, is available under the suite of seven measures available under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) II. Grant aid is available at a rate of 40% with a higher grant rate of 60% available to qualified young farmers. The Scheme is open to new applications with full details of the terms and conditions available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The second phase of the scheme, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems, is expected to open for applications early this year, subject to State aid clearance from the European Commission. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the rollout of the scheme for the period up to 2027.

My vision is that this new Plan will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. I am currently working with my colleagues in Government to develop proposals for inclusion in the new Plan.To inform the development of the Plan, I hosted a High Level Consultative Forum on Friday 18 January. This forum was attended by almost 200 people and included representatives from all of the key sectors responsible for greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland, as well as a strong representation from civil society. </p><p>I intend that actions to deliver the significant investment priorities identified for funding through the National Development Plan will be included in the new Plan, as well as additional actions that will look to taxation, regulation and behavioural change measures to further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s climate mitigation policies. I intend that the Plan will also recognise, and seek to take advantage of, the economic opportunities that the low carbon transition presents for Ireland.</p><p>The Plan will build on existing policy and will be organised around six themes that focus action across Government in all sectors of the economy that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions: </p><p>- regulatory framework; </p><p>- adoption of known technologies; </p><p>- addressing market failure; </p><p>- driving change in business models; </p><p>- the public sector leading by example; and </p><p>- engaging with citizens and communities.</p><p>In developing this Plan, consideration will be given to the proposals referred to by the Deputy. I am also looking forward to receiving shortly the final report and recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action which has, over the last number of months, been considering the report of the Citizens Assembly in relation to climate change. </p></reply>

As Minister for Communications, Climate Action, &amp;amp; Environment, I continue to oversee intensification of preparedness and contingency planning for the wide portfolio under my remit.   Last month the Government published a Contingency Action Plan, setting out its approach to dealing with a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. This is the culmination of many months of work. The Action Plan outlines the Government&rsquo;s assessment of the challenges and the measures considered essential to limit the damage of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; exit and to put in place measures to manage that exit as best as possible.</p>  <p>  The Government and the EU remain committed to securing a negotiated outcome. We are now less than 70 days away from the UK withdrawal from the EU. Contingency preparations for a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome are therefore intensifying as the risk of a disorderly Brexit increases, posing unique and unprecedented challenges. This work continues both at a national and EU level and further information on no deal preparedness will follow in in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s overall objectives have been consistent from the start &ndash; seeking to minimise the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the peace process including avoiding a hard border, maintaining the Common Travel Area and reinforcing commitment to and participation in the EU. These objectives continue to guide our approach, regardless of the type of Brexit which emerges. </p>  <p>  All resourcing of Brexit preparations, staffing and other costs relating to Brexit activities in my Department are met by existing budgets. Potential impact on a particular sector will depend largely on the shape of the future relationship between the EU and UK. Any future expenditure and staffing is dependent on evolving requirements. </p></reply>

The strategy is clear that non-renewable energy sources will make a significant &ndash; though progressively smaller &ndash; contribution to our energy mix over the course of the energy transition. The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p><p>During this transition, gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply. Natural Gas has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation.</p><p>The Shannon LNG project has been designated an EU Project of Common Interest (PCI) by way of an evaluation process organised by the European Commission. The designation of PCI status requires the agreement of Member States. Ireland supported the designation of Shannon LNG as a PCI in the original PCI list in 2013 and in subsequent lists in 2015 and 2017. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the LNG project to which the Deputy refers is a private commercial project and any future investment decisions on the development of this project are a matter for the project promoter.</p></reply>

Further phased steps are planned to upgrade and improve relevant ICT systems and infrastructure.</p>  <p>  While the ICT systems for these enhanced controls are a mattter for the relevant Departments, and not one directly within my area of responsibility,  I am advised that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine secured funds to address ICT hardware and software requirements under the Central Case Brexit scenario in 2019. That Department was allocated &euro;3.25 million for this work in 2019, with &euro;2.75 million assigned for software and &euro;0.5 million for hardware. Preparations are ongoing and I understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine expects to fulfil its ICT requirements in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, the Minister for Finance included provision for a &euro;2 million investment in scaling up Revenue&rsquo;s customs IT framework and they have carried out significant work to increase systems capacity to cater for trade with the UK as a third country. As part of their preparations for Brexit, I am advised that priority has been given to upgrading relevant IT systems to have the most advanced systems possible to support and facilitate smooth and efficient trade flows in a post-Brexit environment. Revenue has advised that performance testing is at an advanced stage and based on testing and the work completed to date, Revenue is confident that their various IT systems will support the expected additional workload arising from Brexit. In the event of a no-deal scenario and if required, the upgrades and enhancements to the systems will be ready for March 2019. </p>  <p>  To facilitate import controls by the Environmental Health Service at Dublin Airport, Dublin Port and Rosslare Port, the HSE is also making every effort to ensure that in a no-deal scenario the necessary information and communications technology infrastructure will be in place by 29 March. </p></reply>

This means that, unless action is taken by the European Commission, a Green Card will be required to demonstrate to the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain that valid motor insurance cover is in place for those vehicles, and vehicles from the UK coming to the State will require a Green Card as proof of insurance.  However, even in the case of a no deal scenario, the EU Commission would be able under the Motor Insurance Directive to declare that vehicles entering the EU from the UK would not require a Green Card.  It would be a matter for the UK authorities to determine whether they required a Green Card for Irish vehicles.  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission on this issue.</p>  <p>  As part of necessary contingency preparations, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has advised that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Green Cards will be begin to be issued to affected policyholders in March 2019 and policy holders are advised to contact their insurers a month in advance of their expected travel date.  This is an example of prudent advance planning by the MIBI and the wider insurance sector. </p>  <p>  The Green Card is used as proof of insurance.  The Department understands that the vast majority of Irish motor insurance policies already include cover for travel in the UK. In such cases drivers will continue to be insured to drive in the UK even in a no-deal Brexit. However, they will need to carry the Green Card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached with the European Commission in the meantime.  </p>  <p>   Not all policies may include such cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In that eventuality, drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain should check their motor insurance policies and, if in doubt, check with their insurers that such travel would be covered.</p></reply>

This was introduced in September 2017 as an interim measure in advance of the ACS. The rate stands at &euro;0.50 per hour up to a maximum of 40 hours per week. </p>  <p>  With the introduction of the ACS in November 2019, if the current subsidy level were to increase from 50c to &euro;2 per hour at that point in time, the 2 month  cost of the ACS (2019 ACS delivery cycle) would be expected to rise to &euro;44.5m, an increase of &euro;12m over the budget available. It should be noted that based on the construction of the ACS subsidies, there would also be an increase in the lowest available subsidy for 0-3 years under the income assessed component of the scheme which has been factored into the &euro;44.5m. There may also be further behavioural impacts with regard to the parental choice of childcare, which are estimated within the costs, but are challenging to accurately predict at this stage.</p>  <p>  In regard to the CCSU programme; the costs for the 2017/18 programme year was &euro;18.6m.  An increase to &euro;2 from 50c would therefore be expected to cost an additional &euro;55.8m on a full year basis for the CCSU scheme having regard to 2017/18 cycle figures.  However, as noted above, the ACS scheme is to be introduced in November 2019 and therefore only a nine / ten month CCSU cost rather than a full year effect would be expected on the CCSU. </p>  <p>  In the 2017/2018 academic year 39,319 children in total benefited from the CCSU programme; with the average monthly take-up equating to some 27,015 children.</p></reply>

These provide for the welfare of the child, including their health, education, assessment of need, care planning, supervision of placement, contact with family, general care practices, care records, and safety precautions.</p>  <p>  A range of accommodation is available to meet the needs of children at risk. Children and young people, depending on their identified needs, may be placed  in foster care, either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, high support or special care or other placement types. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care.</p>  <p>  A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA). Private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. Inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by Department officials. The overview of these reports provides the Department with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children who are at risk.</p>  <p>  Foster care is the main form of alternative care for children in need of care and protection, and is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  As of the 30 September 2018, of the children in care, 92% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,005 children in general foster care, 1,595 in relative care and 374 children were in a residential care placement, with the remaining children in other care placements appropriate to their assessed needs.</p>  <p>  There are regular area recruitment campaigns to meet foster care demands. Fostering teams are responsible for the recruitment and assessment of foster carers. When an assessment is complete, a report is presented to the Foster Care Committee who decide whether or not to approve the applicant.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of an appropriate range of foster carers is part of Tusla's business plan. Tusla are particularly interested in recruiting foster carers with the skills required to look after children with complex needs, or from a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds.</p>  <p>  For children who cannot live either at home or in an alternative family environment such as foster care, there are a number of types of residential care settings that may be appropriate, of which secure care is one type.</p>  <p>  A very small number of children (1.6%) are in other care placements.  Such placements can include supported lodgings, at home under a care order, detention centre/prison, youth homeless facilities, other residential centres e.g. therapeutic, disability, residential assessment, designated mother and baby units.</p>  <p>  It is a fact that sometimes children are detained for their safety in order to provide the care they need.  It is used only where a young person's behaviour poses a real and substantial risk of harm to their life, health, safety, development or welfare. </p>  <p>  New regulations were put in place earlier this year.  These place special care on a full statutory footing for the first time.  The legislation sets a clear time limited and short term period for the use of special care.</p></reply>

This programme is administered through the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs).  </p>  <p>  In 2018, 158 applications were approved for funding of &euro;536,816 for TidyTowns Committees under the Community Enhancement Programme.</p></reply>

This is a &euro;190m national programme that is delivered locally, to help those in the greatest need. The funding allocation to County Kildare for 2018 was &euro;1,061,036. </p><p>- The Community Enhancement Programme, which I launched in 2018, has provided funding of &euro;468,671 to projects in Kildare, including more than &euro;26,000 to Men's Sheds groups, which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information.</p><p>- The LEADER Local Action Group (LAG) in Kildare has been allocated &euro;5,261,600 to invest in the economic and social development of County Kildare over the period of the programme to 2020. In 2018, &euro;640,556 was approved for 16 LEADER projects in Kildare. The LAG received funding of &euro;314,922 in 2018 for individual projects and the administration costs of the LAG itself.</p><p>- The Town and Village Renewal Scheme is another initiative under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and is part of a package of national and local support measures to rejuvenate rural towns and villages  throughout Ireland. I announced details of 224 projects that were approved for &euro;21.3 million of funding under the 2018 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, including eight projects totalling &euro;520,000 for Kildare.</p><p>- &euro;35,000 was provided to Kildare County Council towards the funding of a local broadband officer, increasing to &euro;42,000 in 2019.</p><p>- The Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people. A total of 1,139 installations have been approved for elderly persons in Kildare since September 2015.</p><p>- The Local Improvement Scheme, or LIS, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas. The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities. The funding allocated for 2018 to Co. Kildare was &euro;329,590.00.</p><p>- &euro;85,684 was announced in January 2019 for the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme.</p><p>- The Community Services Programme (CSP) supports community organisations to provide local services through a social enterprise model with funding provided as a contribution to the cost of a manager and an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs).  In 2018, the CSPprovided funding of some &euro;430,000 towards the cost of employing approximately 17.5 full-time equivalents and three manager positions in five community based organisations and social enterprises based in County Kildare.</p></reply>

The findings focused in particular on the administration of the fund, the low level of disbursements from the fund and whether money in the fund could be better applied. </p>  <p>  Since then my Department has worked to ensure these issues are addressed and the money in the fund is put to good use.</p>  <p>  As recommended by the C&amp;AG a review of the operation of the disbursement scheme was completed and published by my Department in July 2018. The review sets out 15 recommendations to improve the administration and operation of the Fund. An interdepartmental group has been established to assist in ensuring the recommendations are progressed. </p>  <p>  The 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan was also published in July 2018, and approved funding of up to &euro;39.7 million for 45 different measures across ten different Government Departments. In line with the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Acts, the measures identified in the Action Plan target social, economic and educational disadvantage; and people with a disability. The approved measures will support a wide range of projects and programmes relating to issues such as social inclusion, assisting migrants, support for carers, speech and language therapy, support for dementia sufferers and sports measures. The majority of measures will commence in 2019, subject to voted expenditure being available within each relevant Department.  </p>  <p>  Good progress is being made and spend from the fund across all Departments totalled &euro;27.8 million in 2018. This is an increase of 78% on the 2017 spend of &euro;15.6 million. My own Department fully utilised its allocation - with &euro;10.1 million spent from the fund in 2018. </p></reply>

Those programmes include the LEADER Programme; the Social Inclusion and the Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO), the Seniors Alert Scheme (SAS), the Community Services Programme (CSP) and the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). </p>  <p>  Each programme that Pobal manages and supports differs, as does Pobal&rsquo;s level and type of involvement in each.  Pobal&rsquo;s role depends on the requirements of the division with responsibility for the programme and does not involve the allocation of funding on behalf of my Department in all cases. For example, in some cases Pobal will work across the programme lifecycle (as with SICAP), whilst in others the role is more limited to specific tasks.  Pobal may assist with providing capital grants in some cases. </p>  <p>  Supports to the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme are for ICT and Pobal also undertake certain Article 48 checks under the programme. Pobal has no function in the allocation of funding to individual LEADER project promoters. The responsibility for allocating funding under the LEADER Programme rests with the relevant Local Action Groups.</p>  <p>  Pobal manages the Community Services Programme on behalf of my Department. It makes recommendations on the allocation of funding .  My Department has overall responsibility for decision making under this and all other programmes Pobal has a role in. </p></reply>

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>   These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>   It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and associated services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.  </p><p>Family hubs offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, with the capacity to provide appropriate play-space, cooking and laundry facilities, communal recreation space, while move-on options to long-term independent tenancies are identified and secured.  </p><p>There are currently 26 hubs operational nationally, offering over 600 units of family accommodation in urban areas. 22 of these are in Dublin, with one each in Cork, Kildare, Limerick and Louth. Further facilities will become operational during the course of 2019, details of which will become available as projects are finalised by housing authorities.</p><p>Capital payments amounting to &euro;14.2 million and &euro;48.5 million were made in respect of operational hub facilities in 2017 and 2018. <b></b>The funding to be provided in 2019 will be dependent on the progress made by local authorities on the development of further family hubs over the rest of the year.</p><p>In relation to the operational funding for the family hubs, my Department provides funding to housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services.  Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources. Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the funding arrangements with my Department.  Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the types of accommodation and the service providers engaged, are a matter for those authorities.  Financial reports from each of the regions, setting out expenditure on homeless services, including family hubs, in each region in 2017, are published on my Department's website at the following link: . The equivalent reports for 2018 are currently being prepared by housing authorities.</p></reply>

These properties are either privately owned or owned by AHBs. Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.</p><p>Details of the total number of properties operational under SHCEP at the end of each of the years 2011 to end Q3 2018 are provided below in tabular form.

Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2019 is &euro;155m&ndash; an increase of &euro;40m over 2018.
