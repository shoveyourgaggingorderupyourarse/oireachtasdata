This engagement involves the identification of key strategic, operational and policy issues arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements. Furthermore, the avoidance of a hard border on the island is fundamental to the Withdrawal Agreement reached in November last between the EU and the UK Government, and there can be no change to the commitments made in that agreement.  As such, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is important to note that primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.</p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners, again, when requested to do so. </p>  <p>  There is ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters and regular coordination and liaison meetings take place. My Department continues to monitor the ongoing situation to ensure that both it and the Defence Forces are fully prepared to address any potential issues that might arise in the defence area as a consequence of Brexit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600052#WRA01200"><p>Ireland has been a participating member State in the European Defence Agency (EDA) since it was established in 2004.  Since then, Ireland has participated in a range of EDA projects and programmes.  These projects have included Maritime Surveillance, Force Protection, Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protection, Cyber and Counter-Improvised Explosives Devices Manual Neutralisation techniques.</p>  <p>  The EDA is focused on assisting Member States in improving defence capabilities through European cooperation.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  Ireland's participation in EDA projects to date, and our planned participation in the Specialist Engineer Search project, approved last week by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, do not involve SOFA agreements or the stationing of foreign troops within the State.  In fact, there is no connection between the role of the SOFAs, which are essentially focussed on operational deployment of military forces and EDA projects which are focussed on capability development.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann recently approved Ireland's ratification of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union SOFAs.  As I explained in the course of the debate, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann does not allow for foreign militaries to be based in Ireland due to the provisions of Article 15.6.2 of the Constitution.  This fact is not changed by Ireland's participation in projects under the EDA.  In addition, Ireland's agreement of both SOFAs is subject to respective Reservations as outlined during the debates.  These Reservations which are based on our Constitutional provisions will be associated with Ireland's instrument of ratification in respect of each of the SOFAs.  The Reservations ensure that the SOFAs will only extend to members of the PDF deploying overseas where these SOFAs apply.  They will not apply within the Irish State. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600052#WRA01500"><p>The act of joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer. Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency Projects. </p>  <p>  Ireland is currently participating in two PESCO projects - (1) The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre and (2) Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance. These projects relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations. Costs associated with participation on these projects would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote.</p>  <p>  In 2018 no additional costs were incurred through PESCO related activities other than costs associated with attendance by Defence Forces Subject Matter Experts at PESCO project planning meetings.  As the projects where Ireland is a Participant are still in the early stages of development, the budgets and timeline for participant's involvement has not yet been fully determined. This may change as projects progress and capabilities are developed and acquired through the PESCO framework. However, it is expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of Member States should prove cost neutral in terms of overall projected defence expenditure.</p>  <p>  In relation to the eight PESCO projects where Ireland is an Observer, there will be no financial impact for Ireland other than when a representative from the relevant Directorate or Service within the Defence Forces attends each of the project meetings.  Ireland's commitment at this time is through our attendance at meetings as the projects progress. </p>  <p>  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP; a development that Ireland welcomes. Security and Defence is a key priority for the European Union in the face of new threats and security challenges which are beyond the capacity of a State acting alone and where Member States must work together to address them &ndash;  e.g. Cyber, Hybrid, Radicalisation, Uncontrolled Migration etc. PESCO provides a mechanism whereby Member States can work together to address these challenges. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600052#WRA01800"><p>In accordance with the  Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the Government and D&aacute;il approval was received on 21st February 2019 for Ireland to participate in a European Defence Agency (EDA) project in relation to Military Search Capability Building.  This Project will develop common processes, techniques and procedures for military search for participating Member States. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces engage extensively in specialist military search activities, dealing with unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and ensuring a safe and secure operating environment for military operations.  Specialist Search and Clearance teams are regularly deployed on both home and overseas operations. There are currently two specialist search teams overseas operating in a peacekeeping capacity in UNDOF and UNIFIL.  These teams are an essential force protection asset in overseas peace support operations.  They conduct route searches and area clearances in advance of vehicle or foot patrols to ensure that the area is free from unexploded ordnance, improvised explosive devices and mines.  At home, the Defence Forces also provide this capability to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in support of Aid to Civil Power operations during high profile visits by foreign VIPs and for searches for bodies and weapons.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces do not have search teams at an advanced search capability level to enable them to conduct Hazardous Environment Search, Working in Confined Space and operating in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear environments.  Participation in this project addresses this capability gap and will assist the Defence Forces in their peacekeeping roles. The training element to Instructor level, within this project, will ensure that this requirement may be met from within the Defence Forces going forward and assist with future training for peacekeeping duties.</p>  <p>  This project, as with all other EDA projects that Ireland participates in, supports the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.</p></reply>

I mention this as it is important to bear in mind, as recognised in the aforementioned Act, that the Curragh Plains is a working environment as well as being a place of historical and cultural importance. </p>  <p>  The Plains are an important working facility for the Defence Forces, the horse racing industry and sheep owners availing of long established rights of pasture.  </p>  <p>  As both a working environment and a high value amenity of ecological importance, I am keenly aware of the multiple challenges facing my Department in ensuring the ongoing management of the Curragh Plains.    </p>  <p>  To this end, my Department has had discussions with Kildare County Council to explore the potential for collaboration on addressing issues and identifying opportunities for the improved management and presentation of the Curragh Plains.  </p>  <p>  As part of these discussions, it was agreed that a multidisciplinary consultancy team should be appointed to examine current and future challenges arising for the area, in the context of the conservation and management of the Plains, and any scope for the developmental potential of the area as a high value visitor and cultural amenity attraction.  </p>  <p>  In the light of this, my Department will consider, in consultation with Kildare County Council, the best way forward and will report back to me on these deliberations.  </p>  <p>  Naturally, any such examination concerning the future of the Curragh Plains will ensure that account is taken of the prime importance placed on the use of the area by the Irish Defence Forces and of the needs of the centrally located Defence Forces Training Centre. </p>  <p>  In relation to the day to day management of the Curragh, the Deputy may wish to note that  the recruitment process for the appointment of additional Curragh Plains land management staff to support the work of the Curragh Maor has been completed  These additional resources will share in the task of overseeing activities on the ground including, but not limited to, litter, sheep branding, patrolling, monitoring users of lands, inspection of property boundaries, illegal encampments and engagement with the public. I can confirm to the Deputy that the additional two employees started work yesterday and will be valuable extra resources in assisting the Maor with the management of the Curragh Plains. </p></reply>

Patients presenting to Defence Forces Primary Carers (Medical Officers or contracted civilian GPs), with a requirement for urgent psychiatric assessment are referred to HSE Accident &amp;amp; Emergency Departments.  Those requiring hospitalisation are admitted immediately. For non-urgent outpatient cases the waiting time for a HSE appointment is approximately 3 months. Therefore, in order to provide Defence Forces Primary Carers with the broadest range of options possible in dealing with the spectrum of cases that present to them, they have also been authorised to refer cases to local external private psychiatrists for outpatient treatment where deemed appropriate. </p>  <p>  An in-house psychiatrist has not yet been appointed to the Defence Forces. By way of background, a 2017 review of the Defence Forces psychiatric service recommended the employment of a full-time military psychiatrist. The previous incumbent providing these services to the Defence Forces on contract retired in May 2018 while arrangements were being made to implement this recommendation.  To continue to provide an interim in-house service until such time as the military psychiatrist position could be filled, efforts were made to engage a locum. However, this proved to be unsuccessful. </p>  <p>  A direct entrant competition for the position of military psychiatrist was launched on 26th July 2018 and closed on 30th September 2018. No applications were received for this competition.  </p>  <p>  To explore every option to facilitate an in-house appointment, I recently gave approval for my Department to conduct a competition for a contracted civilian consultant psychiatrist on a temporary 24-month contract at pay rates equivalent to those available in the HSE. As this is a civilian appointment, sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) is required and has been formally requested. My Department is actively pursuing this matter with DPER. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined on a number of occasions, there is a nationwide shortage of trained psychiatrists, with recruitment issues in a number of sectors of the health service. The difficulty with recruitment for such a position is not unique to the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

Officials from my Department and I hold regular meetings with three Veterans&rsquo; Associations, the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (O.N.E.) and the Association of Retired Commissioned Officers (ARCO).  The Veterans&rsquo; Associations raise issues of concern to their members at these meetings.</p>  <p>  As part of the supports currently offered to veterans, my Department has Service Level Agreements with O.N.E. and IUNVA which set out the services the Department provides to these Associations.  Under the terms of these SLAs, my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. and IUNVA to encourage their valuable efforts and the range of services they offer to ex-service personnel.  The subvention given to O.N.E. was increased from &euro;44,000 to &euro;100,000 per annum last year.  This significant increase in the grant will make a substantial contribution to the work of O.N.E. which provides accommodation to homeless, elderly and disabled ex-members of the Defence Forces in Smithfield, Dublin, Athlone and Letterkenny.  The subvention given to IUNVA is &euro;11,000 per annum.  The funding provided by my Department is to support the general overheads of the organisations. </p>  <p>  I am strongly supportive of O.N.E.&rsquo;s plans to increase the number of its Veteran Support Centres (VSCs) around the country.  The purpose of the VSC is to provide somewhere for veterans to receive information and advice and a welcoming place to meet former comrades.  One benefit of the VSC can be to prevent homelessness through early intervention and to actively address loneliness.  In 2012 O.N.E. established two VSCs in Aiken Barracks, Dundalk and in Lord Edward Street, Limerick.  Since the beginning of 2018, my Department and the Defence Forces have worked with O.N.E. to bring to fruition their plans for a network of VSCs nationwide.  O.N.E. has opened a further six VSCs in Custume Barracks, Athlone; Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel; the Defence Forces Training Centre, Curragh Camp; D&uacute;n U&Iacute; Mhaol&iacute;osa Barracks, Renmore, Galway; Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny; and a temporary office in Collins Barracks, Cork until the permanent VSC is refurbished.  Discussions are ongoing with O.N.E. regarding locations for additional VSCs throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  I provide support by attendance at specific events whenever I can, such as the annual Veterans&rsquo; Day and the launch of O.N.E.&rsquo;s annual Fuchsia fundraising appeal.  </p>  <p>  My Department, the Defence Forces and I are committed to continued engagement with Veterans&rsquo; Associations into the future. </p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and it is currently on a development path arising from the recommendations of the White Paper. </p><p>As of 31st January 2019 the strength of the Reserve is as follows:</p><p>First Line Reserve:  288 personnel</p><p>Army Reserve: 1761 personnel</p><p>Naval Service Reserve: 138 personnel</p><p>A key ongoing challenge for the RDF is to recruit and retain personnel.  I am very much aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment, which provides for 4,069 personnel and recruitment is ongoing.A total of 129 new recruits were inducted to the RDF in 2018.  The Defence Forces will run two recruitment campaigns for the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve this year, one in March and a second in October.  Supports being provided to maximise recruitment to the Reserve include the use of social media and outreach activities by RDF members.  PDF recruit exit interviews now contain information on applying for membership of the RDF. </p><p>Under the current phase of implementation of White Paper actions, two White Paper projects have been identified which are important precursors to the establishment of a Specialist Reserve.  A gap analysis of skills sets in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) will identify potential roles for Reserve members who possess specialist skills.  Options to develop the First Line Reserve are also currently being examined.  </p><p>In 2018, the Chief of Staff assigned the responsibility of Director of Reserve Defence Force to the Director of Combat Support &amp;amp; ISTAR.  In this context, plans for 2019 provide guidance, across all units and formations with RDF assets, in developing their capabilities.  This is in line with the single force concept and the role of the Reserve as described in the White Paper on Defence.  The focus will be to harness RDF skills and talent, maximising its development on the basis of mutual engagement with the PDF.  Specific project areas will focus on training, regulation, recruitment, retention and promotions and will be supported through RDF and PDF reciprocal training, mentoring and education.</p><p>Engagement continues with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) on key issues of import to them.  My officials are scheduled to meet RDFRA in the coming weeks.  RDFRA have been identified as key stakeholders in the RDF relevant White Paper projects and their views will be sought on appropriate matters as the need arises as projects mature and progress.  To that end, RDFRA have been invited to attend a White Paper briefing with my officials on the 11th March 2019.Practical supports to RDFRA consist of quarterly payments by my Department per annum and an annual telephone allowance.  A total of 750 Reserve Mandays are also made available specifically to RDFRA to allow its members conduct association business.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy and RDFRA that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper and having regard to resource availability.  It is my intention to ensure that the momentum on its development is maintained throughout 2019 and the coming years. </p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. Increases due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. An increase of 1% was paid to personnel earning up &euro;30,000 per annum from 1 January 2019. Further increases in pay are scheduled for later in 2019 and 2020.  </p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, may also benefit from the measures to be applied from 1 March 2019, which will see interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales. </p>  <p>  There are many factors and personal circumstances which can give rise to an individual needing support and advice in respect of particular financial difficulties. The Personnel Support Service provides a confidential information, education, support and referral service to Defence Forces personnel and their families, giving access to information and services within and outside the military community. </p>  <p>  Like other military organisations, turnover of personnel is higher than that which normally prevails in other sectors. In this context, there is ongoing recruitment and promotion to replace personnel who depart.  </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is currently examining recruitment and retention issues in the Defence sector. This is on foot of an initial submission from the Department of Defence. The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

However, there are a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe for achieving the 9,500 target. </p>  <p>  One such factor is the number of personnel departing in any given year.  Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. This is not new.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence recognises that continuous recruitment is the lifeblood of the Defence Forces and significant on-going targeted recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force will continue in 2019 with the recruitment plan targeting some 800 new entrants across all services and competition streams throughout the year. As outlined, the precise net gain in strength will be dependent on a variety of factors. This includes the number of trained personnel that depart, the achievement of recruitment targets and the number of trainees that successfully complete training, all of which can vary year on year.  The recruitment process itself is monitored and appraised on a continuous basis to ensure it remains fit for purpose. </p>  <p>  I have previously acknowledged that challenges exist in recruiting and retaining some specialists such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers, and certain Technicians. These specialist can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic environment and jobs market, there are demands for such specialists in other sectors. I understand that this is a challenge being faced by military forces elsewhere and is not confined to Ireland.</p>  <p>  In addition to traditional recruitment methods, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing such vacancies in specialist areas. A scheme has been introduced which permits former Officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel. </p>  <p>  Currently there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised for the recruitment of Medical Officers and Engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.    </p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas. </p></reply>

The 2019 recruitment campaign has already commenced with the recent Naval Service General Service Recruit competition, which closed on 21 January, attracting 969 applications.

The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).   It provides a framework which it is expected will contribute to delivering essential capabilities for CSDP crisis management operations.</p>  <p>In addition to participating in two PESCO projects, Ireland is currently an Observer on eight PESCO projects proposed by other participating Member States.  The significance of Observer Status is that it allows our Defence Forces to keep abreast of developments in a particular area.   Through participating as an observer at Project level, the Defence Forces can gain access to latest thinking and technology on capabilities of interest to them, in a situation where we may not have the level of resources necessary to participate fully in a project.  In addition, participation as an observer allows you to see how a project is evolving and may inform a decision at a later stage as to whether Ireland participates in a particular PESCO project. </p></reply>

The minimum height requirement for general service recruitment is set out in Defence Forces Regulation.  This prescribes a minimum height requirement for enlistment for general service in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) of 157.48cm.  This requirement was introduced following recommendations by a Defence Forces Working Group, which reported in January 2006, and the previous height requirement for both males and females was reduced. </p>  <p>  Entry criteria as set out in Defence Forces Regulations must be observed. In order to provide the information sought by the Deputy, the Military Authorities inform me that it would be necessary for them to inspect the individual file of each general service recruit inducted between the 1st January 2011 and the present date.  Given that there is a regulatory requirement that specific height requirements are met, such a significant investigation could not be justified. In the case of this question, I am informed that several thousand files would need to be inspected.</p>  <p>  The military authorities have informed me also that a study group has been convened by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) in order to review the standards of height for entry into the Defence Forces. The terms of reference for the group provide for the group to assess and recommend changes to the current height standards.</p>  <p>  The group contains representatives from all three services of the Defence Forces and includes medical personnel, personnel from training establishments and military HR. The group convened in late September 2018 and I am informed that the group is in the final stages of deliberations and should report in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces conduct training and education under four broad categories namely; Leadership, Skills, Career, and Collective. Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. A long term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons set out to 2021. </p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p><p>I remain committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards. </p></reply>

The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment. </p><p>Until recently, Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL.  The Finnish contingent also  included an Estonian Platoon comprising some 36 personnel.  Due to other National commitments both Finland and Estonia withdrew from the Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL in November 2018.As an interim measure, an  additional contingent of approximately 106 Defence Forces Personnel have been deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the Finnish contingent for a 12 month period.  This additional commitment will continue throughout 2019 as Ireland has assumed full duties and responsibilities of IRISHBATT up to November 2019.  </p><p>Poland advised that they would be willing to partner Ireland in UNIFIL from November, 2019.  It is proposed that Hungarian personnel would also deploy as part of the Polish contingent.  Discussions on the details of this arrangement are currently being advanced. </p><p>With regard to the deployment of Defence Forces personnel to new military operations overseas, the deployment of a small contingent of Army Ranger Wing personnel to the MINUSMA mission in Mali is under active consideration for 2019. MINUSMA is the UN mission providing support to the Malian Government in reasserting its authority over northern Mali. I must stress however, that these  considerations are at a very early stage and further detailed analysis and planning will be required in advance of seeking Government approval for a deployment. </p><p>The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.  Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the United Nations and UN Peacekeeping.  Our commitment and support for the primary role of the United Nations, in the maintenance of international peace and security, is expressed in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations.  This commitment is also expressed in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP)</p><p>Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are shown in the tabular statement beneath. </p><p><b>MEMBERS OF THE PERMANENT DEFENCE FORCE SERVING OVERSEAS AS OF 01 FEBRUARY 2019</b><table><tr><th></th><th>NTA capital and current Exchequer allocation as per published Agency Statements<br /><br />&euro;m</th><th>NTA Allocation as % of total allocation for Vote </th><th>PSO funding allocated to the NTA under Vote<br /><br />&euro;m</th><th>PSO funding as % of NTA allocation <br /><br /></th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>905</td><td>39%</td><td>276</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>507</td><td>30%</td><td>265</td><td>52%</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>377</td><td>24%</td><td>278</td><td>74%</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>399 </td><td>33%</td><td>227</td><td>57%</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>361</td><td>28%</td><td>212</td><td>59%</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>350</td><td>29%</td><td>210</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>449</td><td>33%</td><td>237</td><td>53%</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>461</td><td>32%</td><td>264</td><td>57%</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>525</td><td>26%</td><td>285</td><td>54%</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>584</td><td>25%</td><td>287</td><td>49%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is made up of 15 Parts relating to matters within the remits of 9 Ministers.</p>  <p>  Prior to its publication, Cabinet met on 3, 15, 22 and 29 January to discuss the provisions of the proposed Bill.  The General Scheme of this Bill was published on Thursday, 24 January.</p>  <p>  The Consequential Provisions Bill focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.  It makes provision for continued access to healthcare, social security protection, student support and protection of consumers.</p>  <p>  As part of this ongoing work, I briefed the Working Group of Committee Chairs on the General Scheme of the Bill on 13 February.  I also briefed the Foreign Affairs Committee, which was attended by members of the European Affairs Committee, on 14 February. Ministers also briefed their relevant sectoral Committees.</p>  <p>  In publishing the Bill, the Government provided detailed technical briefing at official level to opposition parties. The Second Stage debate in this House begins today.  The Government will continue to work closely with all the opposition parties and Oireachtas members to seek their cooperation in ensuring that the necessary Brexit-related legislation will be concluded in a timely manner and in advance of 29 March 2019.</p>  <p>  In addition to the legislative work underway, following the publication of Ireland's Contingency Action plan on 19 December and the European Commission's Plan on 18 December 2019, work has continued on a range of issues and sectors.  This work has included developing mitigation measures including business supports and outreach campaigns which do not require primary legislation, as well as detailed engagement at EU-27 level on mitigation measures on an EU-wide basis.</p>  <p>  Government has since the beginning of January considered memos outlining challenges and possible mitigation measures on key sectors affected by a no-deal Brexit.  Discussions to date have covered a range of key matters including transport connectivity, continuity of supply of medicines, macroeconomic impacts, and implications for agri-food and fisheries.</p>  <p>  Public engagements in preparation for a no-deal Brexit have intensified including, for example, a focused outreach to traders led by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  An update to the Contingency Action Plan was published on 30 January 2019 at a meeting of the Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which also received an update on the intensified work underway.</p></reply>

We attach great importance to combating all forms of persecution and discrimination based on race, religion or belief, and incitement to racism and religious hatred.  Ireland is strongly committed to the promotion and protection of tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression and freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief.  This commitment is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World and more recently in the Programme for Partnership Government.</p><p>Through our multilateral engagement, Ireland consistently raises the issues of racism and intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN&rsquo;s Human Rights Council (HRC) through the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism and at the European Union.</p><p>Ireland also participated in the &quot;United Nations General Assembly Session on Anti-Semitism&quot; in 2015, making a national statement which emphasised the importance of combating all forms of persecution based on race, religion and belief, and incitement to racism and religious hatred. More recently, in 2018, at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, I joined other representatives from other countries in saying &quot;No2antisemitism&quot;.</p><p>During our Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013, Ireland played a key role in the development and adoption of the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief.  These Guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of freedom of religion and belief in the EU&rsquo;s external human rights policy. Additionally, in 2015 Ireland pressed for the inclusion of a reference to the promotion of freedom of religion or belief in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019.  This has ensured the EU&rsquo;s continuing engagement on this issue.</p><p>Twenty-five EU Member States are among the 32 members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), which Ireland joined in 2011.<i></i>IHRA<b></b>unites governments and experts to strengthen, advance, and promote Holocaust education, remembrance, and research worldwide and to uphold the commitments of the 2000 Stockholm Declaration.  Member countries<b></b>recognise that international political coordination is imperative to strengthen the moral commitment of societies and to combat growing Holocaust denial and antisemitism.  I also attended and participated in the National Holocaust Memorial Day in Dublin on 27<sup>th</sup>January this year, during which I read aloud an excerpt from the Stockholm Declaration.</p></reply>

However, British citizens in Ireland are not required to take any action to protect their status and rights associated with the Common Travel Area (CTA), a long-standing arrangement between the UK and Ireland which means British citizens can move freely to live, work, and study in Ireland on the same basis as Irish citizens and vice versa.  Associated reciprocal rights and privileges also include access to health care, social security and the right to vote in local and national parliamentary elections on the same basis as citizens of the other jurisdiction. After the UK leaves the EU, British citizens in Ireland will continue to enjoy these rights, in any scenario.</p>  <p>  Both the Irish and British Governments have committed to the maintenance of the CTA and the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens in any circumstance. To that end, both Governments have committed to undertaking all the work necessary, including through legislative provision to ensure that the Common Travel Area rights and privileges are protected. Considerable progress has been achieved bilaterally with the UK over the past year involving several Departments in what has been a whole-of-Government exercise.  Ireland&rsquo;s shared aim with the UK throughout has been to ensure that the necessary arrangements are made in both countries so that the CTA can function effectively after the UK leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  Protecting and maintaining the Common Travel Area and the associated rights and privileges is a key part of our contingency planning and preparations.  On 22 February, the Government published the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019. This includes the legislation required immediately in a no-deal scenario. The Bill provides for continued access to healthcare, social security protection, student support, protection of consumers, and justice and security measures, in support of the Common Travel Area.  The Government is working with the Oireachtas to ensure that the Omnibus Bill is in place by 29 March.</p></reply>

Multilateral engagement, both in a national capacity and through the EU, is fundamental for adhering to this objective. Ireland works closely with our EU and UN partners in the multilateral fora to monitor compliance with international human rights standards.</p><p>Human Rights concerns are an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s and the EU&rsquo;s relations with all of the states across the Middle East region. Discussions at the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC), whether on the Middle East or other areas, frequently touch on human rights concerns. For example, recent FAC discussions on Syria in February 2019, Iran in December 2018 and Libya in October 2018 all touched on these issues. In February 2019, the FAC adopted Council Conclusions on EU Priorities in UN human rights fora, which reaffirmed the EU commitment to the UN Human Rights system and made specific mention of human rights concerns in countries throughout the Middle East.</p><p>Ireland frequently raises issues of human rights abuses, in a national capacity, through the human rights mechanisms of the UN including the Human Rights Council and Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in Geneva and the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in New York.</p><p>At the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s most recent completed session in September 2018, Ireland raised many concerns under Item 4, as being human rights situations requiring the Council's attention. The situations about which we expressed Ireland's concern included reports of attacks in Yemen resulting in civilian casualties; the continued expansion of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and efforts to prevent outside observers from scrutinising Israel's conduct of the occupation; and restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders in Bahrain. During this HRC session, Ireland also made a national intervention during the Interactive Dialogues with the Commissions of Inquiry on Syria. Ireland will raise a number of human rights concerns in relation to the Middle East in the current session of the Human Rights Council, which opened this week.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is another important mechanism for taking action to highlight human rights violations. Ireland used the UPR session on Yemen in January 2019 to highlight grave breaches of international humanitarian law and challenges to humanitarian access. Ireland made several recommendations to the Government of Yemen including: to engage with the work of the Group of Eminent and Regional Experts appointed by the Human Rights Council; to monitor and report on the situation of human rights in Yemen; and to take all steps necessary to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to conflict-affected areas.</p><p>Human rights will continue to be a key element in Ireland's policy on the Middle East, as they are elsewhere in the world. We will continue to use the most effective and appropriate means to promote respect for human rights, whether this is public statements, bilateral contacts, or indeed working through the EU and UN to highlight the importance the international community attaches to this issue.</p></reply>

We strongly condemn all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where it occurs or who the victims are. We attach great importance to combating discrimination based on religion or belief, and incitement to religious hatred.</p>  <p>  We strive to protect and promote human rights through our work at the EU, the UN, and other international fora. In addition, Ireland frequently raises and will continue to raise the issue of the persecution of minorities through its official bilateral contacts, stressing the responsibility of governments to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.</p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland played a key role in the adoption by the EU of guidelines on freedom of religion or belief during our Presidency in 2013. These guidelines provide a framework for the promotion of this right in the EU's external human rights policy. My EU counterparts and I regularly discuss conflicts in the Middle East at the Foreign Affairs Council, and the need to protect the rights of minority groups is frequently underlined. For instance, the Council adopted conclusions on the Syrian conflict in April 2018, underlining the need for accountability, including for crimes committed against religious, ethnic and other groups and minorities. In addition, the January 2018 Council conclusions on Iraq reiterated the EU&rsquo;s firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups.  Last week, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions on the EU priorities in UN Human Rights Fora which commit the Union to continue to promote and protect freedom of religion or belief and to condemn persecution of religious minorities across the world.</p>  <p>  During the 36th session of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in September 2017, Ireland strongly condemned all forms of persecution and violence committed on the basis of religion or belief and called on all States to prevent such acts, highlighting our concern, in particular, regarding the persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East. Addressing the high-level segment of the 37th session of the HRC in February 2018, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, highlighted threats to freedom of religion and belief and minority religious communities worldwide, including those of Christian, Muslim and Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faiths.</p>  <p>  Ireland also uses the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism of the HRC, to remind countries under review of their obligation to advance fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of religion or belief, under international human rights law.</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians and other minorities in the Middle East. These communities are part of the historic fabric of their societies and countries, and in most cases they have lived peacefully alongside neighbours of different faiths for many centuries. The political turmoil which has overwhelmed many countries in that region in recent years has led to increased concerns about the safety of several religious minorities and other minority groups. ISIS, in particular, has brutally attacked and murdered many communities and groups of people for their religious beliefs. In response to this, Belgium hosted the third international Ministerial Conference on the Victims of Ethnic and Religious violence in the Middle East in May last, year, at which I spoke.</p>  <p>  We believe that the interests of minority groups are best served by pursuing the general goal of pluralism, and we are wary of singling out specific groups in a way which may inadvertently put them at risk. The only sure means of securing the protection of Christian communities and other minorities across the Middle East is through the promotion of sustainable political solutions to the conflicts which have for so long destabilised the region, and have been the key factor in the promotion of radical and extremist ideologies.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief in the Middle East, and across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

The situation in Rukban, where around 40,000 people are located in a makeshift settlement, remains particularly challenging due to the difficulties in securing access for humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call for full unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers to all parts of Syria. This Department continues to engage closely with the United Nations to support its attempts to secure access for humanitarian assistance to Rukban.</p>  <p>  I welcome the 6 February convoy to Rukban jointly organised by the United Nations in Syria and Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) convoy to Rukban.  The UN and SARC delivered a one-month food ration to over 8,000 families, along with shelter materials and core relief items, including blankets, sleeping mats and water containers.  10,000 dignity kits were distributed to women and girls, while critical nutritional supplies were provided to young children. Essential medicine and equipment were provided, and thousands of children were provided with vaccines, educational materials and recreational materials.</p>  <p>  While the delivery of this vital assistance is welcome, the Government shares the assessment of the UN that sustained access is needed and that a dignified long-term solution, enabling people at the site to decide voluntarily and safely how to return to normal life in a place of their choosing, is required.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;118 million in humanitarian assistance since the conflict in Syria began. At the upcoming Brussels III Conference in March we will continue providing much needed funding for humanitarian assistance and supporting the protection of civilians, freedom of movement and sustained access for humanitarian workers.</p>  <p>  But the human suffering caused by the Syrian conflict, including Rukban, can only be brought to an end by reaching a sustainable political solution. Ireland fully supports UN efforts to lead political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254.</p></reply>

We discussed the state of play with regard to the Article 50 process and reviewed political developments in London. We also discussed ongoing contacts between the EU and UK teams on foot of the meeting between Prime Minister May and President Juncker on 4 February when it was agreed that their teams will hold talks on whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament for the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement and respect the EU&rsquo;s position.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier and I remain firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal which fully protects the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government. The European Council has made clear that it stands by the Withdrawal Agreement and that it is not open for renegotiation.  Mr. Barnier repeated to me the EU's openness to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship and the question of the seeking of alternative arrangements to replace the backstop in the future.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier reaffirmed his commitment to the backstop provisions contained in the Agreement, which is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p>  <p>  I also provided Mr. Barnier with an update on Ireland's preparedness for Brexit, including for a no-deal outcome, drawing his attention in particular to the imminent publication of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019. I also thanked Mr Barnier for the Commission&rsquo;s continued helpful and constructive engagement in this area, and their understanding of the particular challenges faced by Ireland. Mr. Barnier reaffirmed this support and commended Ireland for its comprehensive and intensive preparedness work.</p>  <p>  I and my colleagues across Government and our officials will remain in close and frequent communication with the Commission and our EU partners in the coming weeks as we face into another crucial period for the Brexit process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.199.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600054#WRC05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 105 together.</p>  <p>  I refer the Deputies to the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 153 of 5 February 2019, 58 of 7 February 2019, 124 of 12 February 2019 and 129 of 19 February 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade facilitates participation in a range of volunteering opportunities overseas. Typically these opportunities involve placement with, or by, third party organisations and are facilitated by the Department through a range of rosters, registers, initiatives and programmes. Depending on the role and local context, volunteers may need to be able to operate in challenging circumstances. It should be noted that volunteer roster members are neither members of the Department&rsquo;s staff, nor persons to whom the Department provides a service.</p>  <p>  Where prospective volunteers with a disability request a reasonable accommodation arrangement, including to facilitate their mustering as a volunteer, my Department will liaise with the individual and the third party organisation concerned with a view to determining whether a reasonable accommodation can be made having regard to the specific circumstance of the individual and the nature of the volunteering role envisaged.</p>  <p>  In the event that a member of the election observation roster with a disability asks that arrangements be made to faciltate participation in a particular mission, the Department would contact the EU or OSCE, as appropriate, to discuss the request. The decision to make that facilitation would be for the body concerned.  My Department would request that the relevant body take consideration of the individual's skills and specific needs, and also the whether the arrangements sought could reasonably be provided, taking into account the security, infrastructure and logistical environment.  This would need to be done on a mission-by-mission basis.  While Ireland nominates observers, the final selection decision rests with the relevant third party organisation.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland's policy on overseas volunteering is set out in the Volunteering Initiative, which promotes skills-based, sustainable volunteering overseas, working in partnership with third parties. The forthcoming launch of a new White Paper on International Development provides an opportunity to review our approach to overseas volunteering to ensure that it keeps pace with the evolving discourse on volunteering for development, and also with the development of best practice on promoting equality and diversity at home and abroad. The Department will consult with relevant stakeholders to take this work forward.</p>  <p>  The Department is not aware that any member of the Rapid Response Corps roster or any member of the previous election observation roster, who was nominated to participate in an overseas mission in 2017 or 2018, requested an accommodation or dispensation regarding a disability. To date in 2019 no such requests have been received from those shortlisted to either roster. In the event that a request is received the Department will consult with the EU, OSCE or UN as appropriate, to determine the reasonable accommodations which can be made in the mission concerned, having due regard to the individual's needs and also the security, logistical and other conditions of the mission.</p>  <p>  Regarding the recent election roster selection process, as has been outlined in the responses to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 59 of 23 January and 61 and 65 of 6 February 2019, no applicant in that process raised the issue of disability at the time of applying. Had any applicant done so, the issue would have been given our full consideration. In such an event, and notwithstanding that this is a volunteer roster, the Department's approach would have been informed by the reasonable accommodation procedures followed by the Public Appointments Service.</p></reply>

The Vienna Convention was ratified by Ireland in 1967 and incorporated into Irish law by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967. The Convention, which enjoys almost universal ratification, provides for various privileges and immunities for diplomats and certain other persons working at a Diplomatic Mission and the Missions themselves. Under the Convention, it is the duty of all persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the host State, which includes applicable employment law. </p>  <p>  Persons working for Diplomatic Missions &ndash; i.e. for foreign governments &ndash; may in certain circumstances bring legal proceedings in relation to their employment against that government, subject to the Vienna Convention and the rules of state immunity, also known as sovereign immunity. Sovereign immunity is a longstanding principle of international law which applies automatically and is not regulated by the Vienna Convention or domestic legislation. Cases of this nature are on occasion brought to the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>  <p>  In addition to workers employed directly by Missions, there are instances in which diplomatic personnel assigned to Missions in Ireland employ private domestic employees. In such cases these relationships are expected to demonstrate respect for Irish laws and good employment practice.  </p>  <p>  This is set out in Guidelines published by my Department in 2014, which provide clear guidance and a framework for its implementation, underscoring the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the protection of the rights of domestic workers in Ireland, including those employed by diplomatic staff. </p>  <p>  The guidelines, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, set out clearly the Government&rsquo;s expectations in relevant cases regarding payment, employment records, health insurance and social security.  They establish that an agreed undertaking of the terms and conditions of employment, in line with Irish employment law, should be signed by both the employer and the employee - prior to arrival in Ireland - where this is relevant. </p>  <p>  Where sovereign or diplomatic immunity restricts legal proceedings in Ireland employment rights and standards at issue may still be enforceable in the courts of the foreign country concerned, if that state subscribes to those rights and standards. </p>  <p>  While no review of legislation in relation to these matters is planned at present, my Department considers on an ongoing basis how best we can meet our international and national obligations in relation to these matters.</p></reply>

This commitment is reflected in actions across our development cooperation programme and in our engagement with the EU, UN and other international bodies. </p>  <p>  In March 2018 Ireland formally ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). This convention seeks to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.    </p>  <p>  The Convention recognises the importance of international cooperation in advancing its objectives and calls on all states to work in partnership with relevant international, regional and civil society organisations, in particular organisations of persons with disabilities. </p>  <p>  My Department is making progress on disability inclusive development through our policy dialogue, through support for inclusive and accessible essential services, and through support for disability specific interventions. </p>  <p>  At a global level we support the work of the UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNPRPD) to strengthen the capacities of developing countries, and in particular relevant government institutions and organisations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation and oversight of the Convention.</p>  <p>  Through our international development cooperation programme we provide funding to a range of civil society, bilateral and multilateral organisations engaging in health education and human rights work that specifically delivers for people living with disability.</p>  <p>  Ireland's new international development policy will prioritise reaching those further behind first, including people with disabilities.  Through the implementation of this policy my Department will continue its efforts to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities. </p></reply>

Annex 1 of the Protocol lists the EU Directives that have been adopted by the European Union in this area. The commitment to no diminution applies further to all rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity concepts set out in the Good Friday Agreement. The United Kingdom is to set out its commitments in this respect, as well as on the operation of the dedicated mechanisms which form part of its implementation of this commitment. </p>  <p>  The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland "will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights, opportunities and benefits" that come with EU citizenship. Further engagement is needed on which EU rights, opportunities or benefits can be exercised by the people of Northern Ireland who are Irish and therefore EU citizens, when they are resident in Northern Ireland, which will be outside the territory of the European Union after the UK departure. The negotiations on the future relationship of the UK with the European Union will be an important factor in this regard. There is an onus on the UK Government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts in any scenario and it should ensure relevant issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its detailed position and pursued in the discussions on the EU-UK future relationship.</p>  <p>  However, under any scenario for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union, the obligations and commitments of the Irish and UK Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain and the Government will continue to work with the UK Government as co-guarantor to secure the full implementation of the Agreement. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Government has noted and welcomes the commitment by Prime Minister May in her speech in Belfast on 5 February, that the British Government "will uphold the rights enshrined in the Belfast Agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland, right across the whole community.  This includes upholding commitments around mutual respect, religious liberties, equality of opportunity, tolerance and rights."  The Government also noted and welcomes the Prime Minister's acknowledgement that "the birth right to identify and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the Agreement."</p>  <p>  These are welcome commitments and acknowledgements by Prime Minister May.  I have raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the need for the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to be fully taken account of in all relevant policy areas, and there has been ongoing engagement between our officials, including through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the UK Government as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement on this important issue in any scenario.</p></reply>

As stated in section 112 of the Social Welfare Consolidation 2005 Act, the qualified adult portion is an &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in the pension and is payable in respect of a spouse/civil partner/cohabitant who is being financially maintained and whose income is not greater than a specified amount. Finance (No.2) Act 2013, inserted subsection (2B) into section 126 with effect from 1 January 2014.  Subsection (2B) provides that for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, any increase in the state pension in respect of a qualified adult dependent is treated as if it arises to and is payable to the beneficiary of the pension, that is, the person who qualifies for the pension. The intention behind the change to s. 126 in s. 12 of Finance Act (No. 2) 2013 was to put beyond doubt that the beneficiary of a Department of Social Protection pension is assessable on the aggregate of the pension and the amount by which the pension is increased for a qualified adult. Consequently, for the tax years 2014 onwards, one employee (PAYE) tax credit only is available in respect of the pension, including the qualified adult dependent increase, and there is no entitlement to any increase in the amount charged to income tax at the standard rate as a result of the qualified adult dependent increase. </p>  <p>  In the details supplied, the Deputy refers to the ruling of the High Court on 26 June 2018, which determined that (prior to the enactment of Finance (No.2) Act 2013) a qualified adult dependent for the purposes of the old age contributory pension was beneficially entitled, in his or her own right, to the amount of the increase of the pension payment. The High Court case in question was a Case Stated of a determination of the Tax Appeals Commission which found in favour of the taxpayer&rsquo;s claim that an additional, second employee (PAYE) tax credit and extended standard rate income band were due to the taxpayer for 2012 and 2013 in relation to the receipt of the qualifying adult dependent increase in the pension.</p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that there was a review of Revenue&rsquo;s systems for the relevant years prior to 2014 to identify valid claims for refunds.

During this consultation period, the EIB will engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including shareholders, industry associations, civil society and the private sector. The EIB held a consultation meeting yesterday (25 February) in Brussels to engage directly with all stakeholders interested in a direct exchange with the Bank about the review. I understand that written contributions on the consultation document can be sent to the Bank before a deadline of 29 March.</p>  <p>  The new Energy Lending Policy is expected to come before the EIB Board of Directors for approval during this coming Autumn. In advance of this, it is not possible to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process or Board discussions with regard to the Bank&rsquo;s stance on funding fossil fuel projects under its new Energy Lending Policy.</p>  <p>  The Bank&rsquo;s existing approach towards supporting the energy sector is set out in its Energy Lending Criteria (ELC) which was adopted in 2013. As part of the ELC, the Bank introduced an Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) &ndash; a safeguard designed to ensure that the Bank only supports plants that contribute to reducing average emission levels. While the ELC notes that &ldquo;the current and, in all likelihood, future EU energy policy does not prohibit the construction of any new fossil fuel fired power stations&rdquo;, the Bank&rsquo;s use of the EPS effectively rules out the possibility of financing of new coal or lignite fired power stations and potentially other fossil fuel power stations. A recent evaluation of the current policy therefore concluded that the ELC and, particularly, the application of the EIB EPS, has resulted in the Lending Criteria being more stringent than wider EU Energy Policy. </p>  <p>  Under the ELC, fossil fuel related projects are only considered by the EIB in exceptional circumstances. Projects which contribute to the security of supply of isolated energy systems such as small islands with no feasible mainland energy connection and only where there is no economically viable alternative, or in the poorest countries outside the EU where it can be demonstrated that projects with carbon emissions above the threshold will have a significant and material positive impact on poverty alleviation and economic development would define such rare cases.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the new energy lending policy in the EIB will be guided by Government policy in relation to climate change and energy. </p></reply>

However, I have been informed that the Garda Commissioner has indicated his preference that, in principle, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should not be funded by any source other than the exchequer for the purposes of tackling such matters.  He has however indicated his willingness to continue to look at establishing an improved investigative capacity within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) in the area of insurance fraud overall. The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of resources within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and neither I nor the Minister for Justice and Equality has a role in such operational matters.</p><p>It is important to note that an industry-funded Garda unit was a single mechanism proposed as a potential means by which to implement the intent behind the relevant recommendation, the wording of which calls for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation.  In this regard, much constructive engagement has taken place through the Fraud Roundtable, which was formed by the CIWG primarily to implement Recommendation 13 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>, work which culminated in the publication by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the <i>Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</i>in October 2018.  A particularly positive &lsquo;spin-off&rsquo; development from the Roundtable has been that the GNECB and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum &ndash; which is drawn from the fraud sections of the major individual insurers &ndash; have committed to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.</p><p>In relation to the proposal that insurance companies provide (which it is presumed was the intended word in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, instead of &ldquo;receive&rdquo;) a guarantee to reduce premium levels, I believe there is a need to be careful about requesting such commitments, particularly in the context of competition in the sector, as it may send a signal to other insurers about what pricing levels might be.  This is particularly the case in the context of ongoing investigations into the insurance sector by both the European Commission and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  </p><p>However, the above said, I would expect that insurers&rsquo; pricing of premiums in general would take account of the measures which have been, and are being, implemented as a result of the CIWG recommendations more broadly and I believe that insurers themselves recognise this.  In this regard, I would recall that Justice Nicholas Kearns, the Chairperson of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC), noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the PIC repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums will also reduce accordingly.  </p><p>Overall, it is envisaged that the full implementation of all the recommendations taken cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, can achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and businesses, and a more stable and competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013. </p>  <p>  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. </p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and must be complied by all regulated entities as a matter of law. The Central Bank can take action against a regulated entity which does not comply with the CCMA (for example by imposing a direction on such entity or taking enforcement action under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Administrative Sanctions Procedure).</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in the position in relation to the VAT treatment of cookery schools between 2016 and 2019. </p>  <p>  Where a cookery school is providing courses for educational or vocational purposes, any such course is exempt from VAT provided the lessons in question are provided as part of a programme that meets the standards set out by the Department of Education and Skills syllabus or, in the case of vocational training, the course is aimed at acquiring or updating knowledge in relation to a specific profession or trade. </p>  <p>  This means cookery classes aimed at further enhancing the skills of professional chefs working in the hospitality industry are exempt from VAT. Similarly, cookery courses aimed towards developing the culinary skills of trainee chefs are also exempt from VAT. However, where a cookery school is providing courses primarily for recreational purposes the position continues to be that these courses are liable to VAT at the standard rate. A course which is primarily for recreational purposes is undertaken for the enjoyment and satisfaction of the participants rather than for developing skills and knowledge which will assist the participant in their trade or profession. </p>  <p>  If a cookery school has any doubt as to the eligibility for exemption of any of its courses, they should contact Revenue for advice.</p></reply>

It is available to Irish and international film production companies that are resident in the State or in an EEA State and carry on business in the State through a branch or subsidiary. </p>  <p>  A number of  significant changes were made to the credit as part of 2018 Finance Bill process. In recognition of the nature of the production cycle and the long lead in times needed for productions to be undertaken, the credit was extended from its original end date of 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024. Additionally, it was legislated to require production companies to apply for payment of the tax credit under the self-assessment system.  This brings the operation of the credit within the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for incorrect claims. The application process has also been divided between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, it is envisioned that this will in particular contribute to alleviating the much publicised delays being experienced when applying for the credit.</p>  <p>  Finance Bill 2018 also provided for a new short-term, tapered regional uplift, commencing at 5%, for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines.  The regional uplift will be introduced subject to State aid approval. The regions availing of the uplift will be limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU regional aid guidelines.</p>  <p>  The process of notifying the EU of the regional uplift is currently underway but it is not possible to give a definitive timeline as to when this process will be completed.</p>  <p>  Revenue is currently bringing forward the Regulations which are necessary to give effect to the aforementioned Finance Act 2018 amendments. The Regulations must be introduced with the consent of both myself and my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I understand that officials in both Departments are currently reviewing the relevant drafts with a view to providing final drafts for signature in early course.</p></reply>

Under this scheme Revenue will repay some of the mineral oil tax paid by a qualifying road transport operator on diesel purchases when the diesel is purchased within the State and used in the course of business transport activities in qualifying motor vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Qualifying applicants can claim a rebate under the scheme when the VAT inclusive price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.23 per litre, as determined by the methodology deployed by Revenue. The rebate amount progressively increases to the maximum amount repayable of 7.5 cent per litre when the VAT inclusive price is &euro;1.54 per litre or over.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is one of only eight Member States that operates such a scheme and I am aware that there are different views on its merits. My Department's Energy &amp;amp; Environmental Tax Strategy Paper 2017 noted that the Diesel Rebate Scheme is a subsidy, or tax expenditure, and an ESRI study showed that the Scheme has encouraged greater consumption of diesel and this has had negative environmental consequences over the length of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  I made no change to the operation of this scheme in Budget 2019.  As with all taxation measures, the operation of the scheme is kept under review as part of the annual Budget process each year. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out to the Deputy that CSO consumer price data shows that the retail price of diesel has significantly decreased since October 2018.   </p></reply>

This work culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  The EL/PL Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, to be carried out in agreed timeframes set out in an Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The recommendations from these two primary Reports are often inter-related and overall represent an important part of the broader insurance reform agenda.  Key recommendations in the two Reports seek to increase transparency in the sector, as well as improve the personal injuries litigation framework and costs environment by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and reviewing the level of damages in personal injury cases.  </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations from the two Reports by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and the Working Group has published quarterly updates on its progress.  The seventh such update was published in November 2018 and shows that of the total number of 78 separate relevant deadlines within the Action Plans of the two Reports set up to the end of Q3 2018, 63 relate to actions which have been completed.  </p>  <p>  Both of the primary Reports and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the next quarterly Progress Update will be completed by the end of this month and in relation to the EL/PL Report, I can inform the Deputy that the vast majority of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been done, and am confident that any outstanding action points will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019. </p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:</p>  <p>  - The publication by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the &ldquo;Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its draft Fifth Programme of Law Reform</p>  <p>  - Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to  ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses  and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system</p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that it will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of both the Motor and Employer and Public Liability Reports. In particular, there will be an emphasis on implementing the recommendations of the second Personal Injury Commission Report in order to try and bring the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the implementation of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will result in a more competitive insurance market and thus increased stability in the pricing of insurance in general including public liability cover. </p></reply>

From these engagements, it would appear that the main difficulty in these sectors is a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in these sectors.</p>  <p>  In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be. Therefore, part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Therefore I cannot compel insurers to provide cover to businesses such as play centres or marts.</p>  <p>  The above said however, it was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants. In this regard, the initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums, and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  </p>  <p>  The second phase of the CIWG, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, culminated in the issuing of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.  It makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions, detailed in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.</p>  <p>  The most recent Progress Update was published last November and shows that 18 of the 19 actions points in the Employer/Public Liability Report arising up to end of Q3 2018 have been completed.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the next quarterly Progress Update will issue by the end of this month and I understand that the vast majority of the total of 26 action points which were due for completion during 2018 overall have been done.  I am confident that any outstanding action points will be completed in the coming months, along with the three remaining action points with deadlines set for various quarters throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  The actions implemented to date cut across a number of different areas and include:</p>  <p>  - The publication of by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the &ldquo;Guidelines for the Reporting of Suspected Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Insurance Entities to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;</p>  <p>  - The Law Reform Commission confirming that the subject of caps on damages for personal injuries litigation is included in its draft Fifth Programme of  Law Reform</p>  <p>  - Sections 8 &amp;amp; 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 have been amended to ensure defendants are appropriately notified of a claim having been submitted against their policy and to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, respectively</p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commencing the collection of statistics under the new &ldquo;insurance fraud&rdquo; category which has been added to the PULSE system</p>  <p>  - The Courts Service confirming that they will publish a more detailed breakdown of awards in personal injury cases in its Annual Reports.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance. In particular, there will be an emphasis on implementing the recommendations of the second Personal Injury Commission Report in order to try and bring the levels of damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the implementation of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will result in a more competitive insurance market and thus increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses in the leisure sector including play centres as well as sectors such as marts.</p></reply>

While it has been possible to carry out this work in two locations (Montiagh South and a further stretch of the Montiagh North Road), it has not been possible to identify any practical working solutions to the difficulties associated with raising the third section of road which provides  access for the residents in Gortcloonmore, without putting the existing road at risk of collapse.</p>  <p>  Following further discussions, Galway County Council (GCC) agreed to carry out an independent review of the proposed road design at Montiagh North (Gortcloonmore) and to examine potential alternatives to see what level of road raising could be undertaken, without putting the existing road at risk of collapse. GCC has completed this review but unfortunately, it has not been able to identify any practical working solutions to the difficulties associated with raising this road. The Council&rsquo;s findings were based on looking at a wide range of construction techniques and the results were in line with the original findings of the OPW. </p>  <p>  In a further effort to find a solution to this access problem, Galway County Council commissioned Consulting Engineers to complete a report into the possibility of providing an alternative access route - to and from the N84 - for the four residential dwellings in Gortcloonmore as an alternative means of emergency access during a severe flood event. However, the report which was finalised recently, failed to identify a practical alternative route.  </p>  <p>  The OPW has advised the residents individually of the difficulties as outlined above and of the fact that road raising at Gortcloonmore section of road is being omitted from the Claregalway Flood Relief Scheme as Confirmed. The OPW has also advised the four residential property owners that it is prepared to meet again with their representatives in order to explore any further mitigation measures that might be considered to ameliorate the fact that we are not in a position to complete road raising in Gortcloonmore.</p></reply>

There are currently over 117,500 children, including over 13,000 children with special educational needs, transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually. The safety of children and those on board school transport vehicles is the number one priority for the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  The school transport fleet is made up of both Contractors Vehicles and Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles. Bus &Eacute;ireann procures vehicles to operate school transport services on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The categories of vehicles procured are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Taxi  &ndash; up to 8 seats</p>  <p>  - Minibus &ndash; 9 to 18 seats</p>  <p>  - Medium bus &ndash; 19 &ndash; 34 seats </p>  <p>  - Large bus &ndash; 35 + seats</p>  <p>  The vehicle sourced for any given route is dependent on the route travelled, the number of pupils requiring transport, and the individual requirements of the child, as in the case with transport for children with Special Educational needs. </p>  <p>  Contracts for School Transport Services are awarded based on the most economically advantageous tender.  The most economically advantageous tender is evaluated based on the weighted criteria set out in the Conditions of Tendering document.  A total of 1000 marks (100%) is available. The Quality/Price ratio is 40:60.  A minimum quality threshold of 60% applies to each of the quality criteria.  Only tenders which meet each Minimum Quality Threshold will be evaluated on Price.  Scoring tables are provided in the Conditions of Tendering document with details on how marks are awarded for each of the quality criteria.  </p>  <p>  In regard to safety, in order to be considered roadworthy a bus must pass an annual Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT), conducted under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) at approved test centres around the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport providers are contractually obliged to ensure that their vehicle has an up to date roadworthiness certificate issued by an RSA accredited test centre when a contract is signed. The contractor is obliged to keep their roadworthiness certificate current and up to date at all times and provide Bus &Eacute;ireann with evidence of this. All school buses in service - procured by Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide services under the School Transport Scheme - that are subject to roadside inspections must have current roadworthiness certification at the time of inspection.  </p>  <p>  A detailed contract is put in place for all contracted services &ndash; which includes numerous safety-related items. There is a strict process in place before any vehicle or driver is added to the approved list for provision of services under the School Transport Scheme. Required documentation is checked and copies are held by Bus &Eacute;ireann offices. This documentation includes insurance and insurance indemnity, valid Road Passenger Transport Operator Licence (with required vehicles added), valid Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW), appropriate valid Public Service Vehicle licence (large/small) (PSV) and evidence of Tax Clearance. Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts also include a stipulation that requires all contractors to have planned maintenance programmes, with checking intervals of not more than six weeks.</p>  <p>  Every Contractor is also responsible as an individual bus operator, licensed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to ensure they comply with legislation in all respects.</p>  <p>  In addition to statutory requirements, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges for additional sample auditing of contractors vehicles operating under the Scheme, throughout the year.  These additional quality assurance checks are carried out by independent vehicle inspection auditors, on both a targeted and random basis. Almost one in five buses contracted to the School Transport Scheme are audited under these quality assurance checks, which are designed to monitor the condition and roadworthiness status of each vehicle checked.  Vehicles that fall short of the standards required during the audits are immediately withdrawn from further service until all identified issues are rectified by the contractor. If contractors are found not to have carried out the required improvements to their fleet and systems, they face penalties up to and including termination of contract. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles are brought into the garage every six weeks for a full maintenance checks. </p></reply>

This was the biggest change to the PAYE system since the1960s.  From the 1 January 2019, employers are required to report their employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions to Revenue for each payroll issue. </p><p>The issue related to the taxation of the substitute staff and is confined to those who were paid in the first three payrolls of 2019 &ndash; payment issue dates of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>and 17<sup>th</sup>January.  A cessation date was included in the payroll files sent to Revenue on the </p><p>3<sup>rd</sup>and 17<sup>th</sup>January for post primary substitute teachers and on 10<sup>th</sup>January for primary and non-teaching staff.  The new Revenue system updated the employees&rsquo; records immediately and assigned zero credits to them which meant that when they were next paid, for some substitutes, there were no tax credits available to be applied to the salary.</p><p>The payroll software was amended in mid-January to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue for future payments. This meant that any substitute staff paid for the first time in 2019 after the 17<sup>th</sup>January do not have problems with tax credits. </p><p>However this software amendment did not correct the issues that arose for the staff who were paid already in the first three payrolls of 2019.</p><p>My Department and Revenue accorded the highest priority towards a correction of the tax issues for those substitute staff impacted in the first three payrolls and refunds have now issued to 69 post primary payees, 533 primary payees and 177 non teaching staff payees. The refunds range in value from &euro;0.24 to &euro;1,281.71.</p><p>Approximately 600 additional refunds will be issued through the post primary payroll this week ( 28<sup>th</sup>February). </p><p>My Department is also making arrangements to ensure that refunds, where due, are generated for those that have not worked since the payrolls issued in January. </p><p>Substitute staff experiencing financial hardship can contact my Department and seek a letter that they can submit to financial institutions. The letter will give background details on the issue.  My Department is responding to emails being received and has three dedicated email addresses that are being monitored for substitute staff with queries. There are also dedicated phone lines for substitute staff to contact my Department.</p><p>Where a substitute teacher/non-teaching staff member has more than one employer, the Revenue Commissioners will issue Revenue Payroll Notifications (RPNs) based on the information available to them.  Employees may have more than one source of taxable income and may assign credits to more than one employment.  Tax credits and taxable basis are decided by Revenue and notified to the employer to apply to payrolls.  Any refunds of tax to staff are based on the information supplied by Revenue.</p></reply>

The main objectives of the scheme is for employers, wherever possible, to facilitate applicants in areas such as Personal Development, Voluntary Service Overseas, accompanying  spouse/partner on Diplomatic/Military Posting, Education, Public Representation, Childcare/Dependent care and Self-employment.

Informed by the outcomes of that audit, the Council selected five jurisdictions for a more in-depth curriculum investigation.  A review of literature on computational thinking was also completed.  These research reports are available at <i>www.ncca.ie/en/primary/primary-developments/coding-in-primary-schools.</i></p><p>The research informed the design of the <i>Coding in Primary Schools Initiative</i>which began in 2017.  Phase 1 of the initiative involved working with 15 primary schools which had invested significant time and financial resources alongside building staff expertise in the area of coding and computational thinking.  The NCCA&rsquo;s work focused on gathering information from the schools about their work with coding.  These &lsquo;classroom stories&rsquo; help to answer questions such as, what types of coding experiences are teachers currently providing?  Where in the primary curriculum is this work happening?  Which classes are involved?  Why did the teacher/school start work on coding?  What are the benefits and challenges? </p><p>Examples from this work are also  published at <i>www.ncca.ie/en/primary/primary-developments/coding-in-primary-schools</i>and have informed the development of materials to support other schools in introducing coding and computational thinking as part of Phase 2 in the initiative.  This second phase began in May 2018 and involves 25 additional schools which, prior to the initiative, had little, if any, experience with coding.  The purpose of Phase 2 is to explore how, where and to what extent coding and computational thinking should be integrated into a redeveloped primary curriculum.  The initiative will conclude in the coming weeks and a report will be finalised and submitted to me for consideration.</p><p>The Deputy may be interested to know that at Post-Primary level an optional short course in Coding is available to all schools as part of the recent developments at junior cycle and coding is also a central element in the new Leaving Certificate Computer Science subject introduced in schools since last September.  Computational thinking also features very significantly in revised specifications for Mathematics at both junior cycle and senior cycle levels.  It is important to note that extensive reviews of both the primary curriculum and senior cycle education are currently underway and these too will consider the role and place of coding in the curriculum.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p>  <p>  My Department's policy is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs in mainstream school settings, unless such a placement would not be in the best interests of the child concerned, or the children with whom they will be educated. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through it's network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p>  <p>  The selection and enrolment of pupils is the responsibility of the management authorities in each individual school. </p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area, can between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing specialised placements, including placement in special schools.  </p>  <p>  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to  disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parent&rsquo;s choice are respected.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the North Dublin area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2019/20 school year and beyond.</p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which commenced on Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide me with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's questions relates to a particular special school, I have arranged for it to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

SPHE provides specific opportunities to enable the child to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.  It is a particular concern of the curriculum to develop in the child respect and care for his or her body.  It also enables the child to acquire the knowledge and attitudes that help to promote a healthy lifestyle.  As part of this the child should be enabled to recognise and practise basic hygiene skills such as: personal hygiene practices, hygienic eating habits, developing basic skills in dressing himself/herself and caring for clothes, taking proper care of teeth.</p></reply>

As set out in the NDP, part of the Construction Group's remit is to consider the supply of necessary skills and enhancing the capacity of the sector.  The NDP also highlights the importance of examining the role of Building Information Modelling and adopting other technologies and innovative practices in driving improving productivity and efficiencies.  The work of the Group will, therefore have an important role to play in ensuring that the construction sector enhances its capacity to meet infrastructural priorities over the next decade. </p>  <p>  The Government is also closely monitoring all aspects of construction skills and labour supply, through the national skills database and through the work of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora.  A study of the construction sector will be undertaken by the EGFSN in 2019.</p>  <p>  In responding to specific skill needs for the construction sector, a particular focus of my Department and the education and training sector more generally has been an expansion in apprenticeship recruitment.  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme, which aims to develop the skills of an apprentice in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market. Consequently, the number of construction related apprentices being registered is determined by employers within the construction sector. My Department and SOLAS are committed to supporting the registration of apprentices in the construction sector. </p>  <p>  There were 3,398 construction related apprenticeship registrations in 2018 which represents an increase of 14% on the 2017 figure of 2,971 and almost 47% on the 2016 figure of 2,316.  Registrations on craft apprenticeships are forecast to increase further up to 2020.</p>  <p>  The range of apprenticeships on offer is also being expanded to meet the identified skill needs of the sector.  Arising from the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s two calls for apprenticeship proposals apprenticeships in Engineering Services Management, scaffolding and senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship are currently being developed into national apprenticeship programmes.  The Construction Industry Federation (CIF) is industry lead in the Engineering Services Management and scaffolding apprenticeships and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is Industry lead in the senior quantity surveyor apprenticeship. These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs identified by the sector.  </p></reply>

These contracts are generally awarded on the basis of lowest tender.</p><p>For larger or more complex school building projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted Procedure is normally used. In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 8 - 10).  The pre-qualification process uses a combination of pass/fail criteria and qualitative criteria to establish the tender short-list.  All criteria have minimum standards which must be met.  These contracts are then generally awarded on the basis of the lowest tender.</p><p>Tenders for projects being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Design &amp;amp; Build&rdquo; programme are evaluated using the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) approach. This means that the criteria for the award of the contract include technical merit as well as price.  In the case of the Department&rsquo;s current Design and Build programme<i>, </i>Technical Merit carries a 60% weighting and Price carries a 40% weighting.Over 150 projects have been delivered under the Department&rsquo;s Design and Build programme since it was commenced in 2008.</p><p>The evaluation of tenders for projects being delivered under Public Private Partnerships (PPP) arrangements has also used the MEAT approach. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) is responsible for the procurement of PPP projects in the education sector. </p><p><b>Design Teams </b></p><p>For design team appointments on projects with a construction value over &euro;1m in value the criteria for contract award are:<table><tr><th>Price</th><th>A</th><th>Price</th></tr><tr><td>Quality</td><td>B1</td><td>Tendered   Rates</td></tr><tr><td>Quality</td><td>B2</td><td>Resources   (hours devoted to project)</td></tr><tr><td>Quality</td><td>C</td><td>Project   Assessment (Site and Project Specific Issues)</td></tr></table></p><p>For appointing design teams for small projects (i.e. projects with a construction value of less than &euro;1m) the criteria are:</p><p>1. Summary of service to be provided. </p><p>2. Competency of the firm to carry out the work.</p><p>3. Project delivery (how the project can be completed on time and within budget)</p><p>4. Price.</p></reply>

Schools should supervise and support children who are distressed or out of control until they have recovered and are able to re-engage in the classroom. In some circumstances this may mean the temporary removal of a child from the environment where the problems have arisen. Schools are not required to report on such interventions. </p>  <p>  Schools owe a duty of care to all their students and any action taken in relation to managing behaviour must be proportionate.</p>  <p>  Tusla's Educational Welfare Service, under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has published guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour which all schools are required by law to have in place. The guidelines advise that specialised behaviour management strategies, such as the use of restraint, should not be used without expert advice, training and monitoring. In particular, the guidelines point to certain sanctions which are regarded as inappropriate, including leaving a student in an unsupervised situation while in the care of the school. All parents must be made aware of behaviour management strategies employed by the school.</p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Services psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service which includes Special Educational Needs Organisers, the National Behavioural Support Service and the Special Education Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.</p>  <p>  A range of guidance is available for schools in relation to the management of student behaviour. The Department published Guidelines for Supporting Pupils with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social Difficulties, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.education.ie. The National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural, Emotional and Social Difficulties &ndash; A Continuum of Support also provides advice for teachers, including some advice on the use of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; procedures in the classroom.</p>  <p>  Training is available for schools in relation to the provision of support for children with special educational needs from the NCSE&rsquo;s Regional Service. The Special Education Support Service can, as part of their designated training modules, provide guidance for schools in relation to the management of difficult behaviour.</p>  <p>  The NCSE&rsquo;s Policy Advice Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Schools (2015) recommended that the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills develop guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of crisis student behaviour situations in schools.  </p>  <p>  Having considered the matter, my Department has undertaken to develop new guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours (including the use of physical interventions) where such behaviour is considered as likely to present serious risk of physical harm to the student concerned and/or others within the school environment.</p>  <p>  A Working Group has been established to develop the guidelines and work is ongoing in this regard. The Department will engage with education partners on the guidelines in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the guidelines will be finalised by the end of this school year. </p>  <p>  The guidelines will be underpinned by the principles that such intervention is never used for the purposes of discipline; that it should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to de-escalate the situation. The guidelines will also underline the importance of continued supervision of children during a crisis period including matters related to behaviour. It is also expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.</p>  <p>  The guidelines will apply to all recognised schools. They will place a strong focus on prevention and early intervention strategies for the management of crisis student behaviour in which physical intervention may be employed only as the last part of a comprehensive, positive and planned behavioural approach by the school. Implementation of the guidelines will be supported through the provision of information and training supports.</p>  <p>  The guidelines will be informed by the evidence which shows that whole school positive behavioural approaches and early and ongoing engagement with the school community, including parents, are necessary for the development of effective school policy and practice.</p></reply>

The site has been master planned for 24 classrooms in recognition of possible future demographic growth in the area. The project has been devolved to Westmeath County Council (WCC) for delivery.</p>  <p>  The project had been scheduled for completion for September 2018. However, the contractor experienced a number of issues such as unforeseen ground conditions and the severe weather events of late 2017 and early 2018. The expected completion date for the project is now July 2019. </p>  <p>  The ongoing delay of this project is extremely disappointing and frustrating for all parties involved.  It is, however, in the nature of any building project, whether it is a school, an office block or a house, that unforeseen issues can arise.  The objective always is to deal with these as efficiently as possible to minimise delay.    </p>  <p>  WCC is continuing to pursue the contractor for as speedy a delivery of the project as possible.  It has the full support of my Department in its efforts to achieve this without compromising the integrity of the building being delivered.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that the school is kept fully up to date with progress on the project, WCC is issuing monthly progress reports to the school's Board of Management. This approach will provide accurate and precise information to help the school to plan and manage its needs until its permanent accommodation is available. The Deputy may also wish to note that officials from Department recently joined WCC at a meeting with the school authority so as to discuss and address its concerns.</p>  <p>  The budget for this project included a contingency for unforeseen circumstances. The Deputy can be assured that any deviation from the budget due to unforeseen circumstance is being closely monitored by both Westmeath County Council and officials from my Department.</p></reply>

School management authorities are also responsible for ensuring there are up to date policies and procedures in place in relation to child protection.  In carrying out their functions, school management must have regard to the law, relevant Departmental circulars and guidance. The principal has overall responsibility for the day to day leadership and management of all staff in the school including responsibility for ensuring that staff understand their roles and responsibilities. Where staff have concerns, these should be raised with local school management in the first instance. </p>  <p>  With regard to the management of the intimate care needs of children in schools, my Department is of the view that there is a need to strike a balance between adequately protecting the child on the one hand and preserving the child's dignity on the other.  In general therefore, there is no requirement for two SNAs to be present in the management of intimate care needs situations.  Schools are required to have a care plan for each student for whom SNA support is provided and the SNA role in supporting the student should be agreed with parents as part of the care plan. </p>  <p>  In the context of its Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme, the NCSE has recommended that guidance be prepared for schools in this area and this is currently being considered by my Department.   </p></reply>

In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by &euro;674 million, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget will have increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  Budget 2019 will see numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level. Over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.  </p>  <p>  The 2018/19 school year saw an increase of over 6000 teaching posts in our schools compared to the 2015/16 school year.  </p>  <p>  Each 1 point adjustment to the pupil teacher ratio at post primary level is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;63m per annum (approx. 1,000 additional teaching posts).</p>  <p>  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools including pupil teacher ratios and teacher numbers. The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratios show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.3:1 at primary level and 13.8:1 to 13.1:1 at post primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2017/18 school year.</p></reply>

Any persons who believe that they are eligible to a waiver in respect of QQI certification fees already paid are advised to submit a waiver fee request to the SOLAS Construction Services Unit, giving evidence of unemployment/medical card details at the time.  SOLAS will forward a waiver fee application form to the applicant, which will require validation by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Health Service Executive, for the time period in question, and should be submitted to SOLAS for processing.</p>  <p>  Further information regarding QQI certification fees and the waiver process can be found on the SOLAS website.</p></reply>

The Safe Pass programme is administered by SOLAS and operated by a network of mainly private SOLAS-approved training providers. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the Safe Pass programme is, over the course of time, to reduce construction related fatalities, injuries and illnesses by decreasing the number and frequency of construction site accidents by raising the level of health and safety knowledge and awareness across the construction sector.  The Safe Pass Programme is continually adapted and developed in line with international best practice to ensure the content of the programme is current, fit for purpose and keeps abreast of changes in safety legislation, developing best practice in safe behaviour on site and the ever changing profile of the workforce and work environment in the construction industry.  </p>  <p>  A valid Safe Pass card can only be obtained upon successful completion of the Safe Pass Safety Awareness training programme.  It is a condition of renewal of the registration card that participants must update their safety awareness training every four years, which in line with Section 10 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and is fully supported by all partners within the construction sector. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the current amendment to the regulations is to provide additional clarity to the renewal process.  However, SOLAS are empowered to require the refreshing of safety awareness training before cards are renewed and this will continue.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools or keeping waiting lists.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of ASD special classes from 330 in 2011 to 1,196 across the country now.  This includes 131 ASD early intervention classes, 743 primary ASD classes and 322 post-primary ASD, providing approximately 786 Early Intervention placements, 4,458 primary ASD class placements and 1,932 post-primary ASD class placements.  </p><p>124 special schools provide specialist education for those students with the most complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with ASD.  </p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs for the years referred to by the Deputy are available by county in tabular form on the NCSE website at <i>www.ncse.ie </i></p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need.  This process is ongoing.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional special class provision is required. In those circumstances, Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. This process is ongoing and the NCSE are actively engaging with schools in relation to establishing ASD classes where there is an identified need for the 2019/2020 school year.</p><p>Section 8 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which commenced on the 3rd of December 2018, provides the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>In circumstances, where the NCSE confirm that there is no school placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department's Home Tuition Grant Scheme will provide funding towards the provision of 20 hours tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement is available.</p></reply>

At primary level, there was a survey of school principals using the following socio-economic variables: %unemployment; %local authority accommodation; %lone parenthood; %travellers; %large families (more than 5 children); %pupils eligible for free books.  At post primary level a combination of data from the Departments pupil database including school level retention rates together with exam achievement data and exam fee waiver data, which indicated that students had medical cards, was used.  </p><p>Following a review of DEIS in 2016 and an extensive consultation process, a new identification process was developed for assessing schools levels of concentrated disadvantage. The key data sources used in the new DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Haase Pratschke Deprivation Index  (HP Index).  The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>.</i></p><p>Following an initial application of this new methodology, 79 new schools were brought into the DEIS programme in 2017 with a further 30 being upgraded from Band 2 to Band 1 status.  These schools were assessed as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage.  </p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p></reply>

This was the biggest change to the PAYE system since the 1960s.From 1 January 2019 employers are required to report their employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions to Revenue for each payroll issue. </p><p>The issue related to the taxation of substitute staff and in the case of primary staff was confined to those who were paid in the payment issue date of the 10<sup>th </sup>January.A cessation date was included in the payroll file sent to Revenue on the 10<sup>th</sup>January for primary staff.  The new Revenue system updated the employees&rsquo; records immediately and assigned zero credits to them which meant that when they were next paid, for some substitutes, there were no tax credits available to be applied to the salary.</p><p>The payroll software was amended in mid-January to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue for future payments. This meant that any substitute staff paid for the first time in 2019 after the 17<sup>th</sup>January do not have problems with tax credits. However this software amendment did not correct the issues that arose for the staff who were paid already on the 10th January.</p><p><i></i>My Department and Revenue accorded the highest priority towards a correction of the tax issues for those substitute staff impacted in that payroll.  The new record format to resolve the issue was implemented in the primary staff payroll of the 21st February and generated refunds for 533 primary substitute payees.  My Department is also making arrangements to ensure that refunds, where due, are generated for those that have not worked since the payrolls issued in January. </p><p>Where a primary substitute teacher has more than one employer, the Revenue Commissioners will issue Revenue Payroll Notifications (RPNs) based on the information available to them.  Employees may have more than one source of taxable income and may assign credits to more than one employment.  Tax credits and taxable basis are decided by Revenue and notified to the employer to apply to payrolls.  Any refunds of tax to staff are based on the information supplied by Revenue.</p></reply>

As the Minister for Health also conveyed on that occasion, in liaison with my Department, Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which provides for a pre-action protocol for use in clinical negligence cases, is also set to amend the limitation period in respect of such actions, by increasing the current 2 year limitation period to that of three years. Preparations at my Department, in conjunction with Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel, for the commencement of Part 15 of the 2015 Act and the issue of the relevant regulations for a pre-action protocol, are at an advanced stage. </p><p>As with the introduction of the proposed new pre-action protocol, the increase in the limitation period follows a recommendation made by the Working Group on Medical Negligence and Periodic Payments in its Report of March 2012 which is publicly available on the website of the Courts Service at <i>www.courts.ie</i>. The Working Group took the view, having looked at other jurisdictions and supported by a number of submissions made to it in the course of its consultation exercise, &quot;that the current limitation period of two years applicable to personal injuries actions generally, is too restrictive and does not take account of the particular complexities associated with clinical negligence claims and the extent of their reliance on expert evidence of various types&quot;. The Group therefore considered that &quot;an extension of the limitation period to three years for clinical negligence claims would strike the appropriate balance between the legitimate interests of claimants and respondents to such claims&quot;.  The policy decision to introduce this extension under Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 is, therefore, considered to strike the appropriate balance while also providing reasonable time to enable clients engage in the pre-action protocol process as a reforming measure that can help to reduce the number of time-consuming and costly clinical negligence actions that come before the courts. </p></reply>

In regard to sentencing, the approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. </p>  <p>  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. </p>  <p>  The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing. As the Deputy is aware, sentencing practice was also developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish sentencing information system, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the Deputy will also be aware that the Judicial Council Bill is currently awaiting Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In its published form, the Bill provides for the establishment of a Sentencing Information Committee which will be responsible for the collation of sentencing information and the dissemination of that information. To facilitate it in carrying out its functions, it is envisaged that the Committee will have access to court documents relating to criminal proceedings. In addition to the collation and dissemination of sentencing decisions and information on those decisions, it will be empowered to conduct research and organise conferences, seminars and other events. As a general principle, the information will not disclose the names of the parties to the proceedings covered by the decisions. However, an exception will be made to this principle where disclosure is required by a judge in relation to proceedings before him or her or where it is necessary to facilitate submissions to the court by a party&rsquo;s legal representative in relation to the sentence to be imposed. </p>  <p>  A set of amendments aimed at transforming the Sentencing Information Committee into a Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee has been developed within my Department and will form part of a package of amendments to the Bill which will be brought forward once Committee Stage is scheduled.  </p></reply>

Furthermore, there was a carryover of &euro;2.5 million in capital expenditure from 2018 to 2019, which is allocated to ICT Capital, bringing the total capital allocation in 2019 to &euro;54.017 million.</p>  <p>  It comprises &euro;11.42 million for maintenance and development of new and existing ICT systems, &euro;4.88 million for courthouse capital works and &euro;37.717 million for unitary charge payments in relation to the Criminal Courts of Justice in Dublin and a number of regional courthouses provided under Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that it is progressively improving the facilities and technology available for the use of victims of crime in courthouses around the country. The funding for these developments, while not ring fenced, is provided for from within expenditure heading allocations for Courthouse Capital, Courthouse Maintenance and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). </p>  <p>  I am informed that from its allocated funding in 2019 the Courts Service is planning to provide video conferencing technology in the District Court Family Law Courts in Dolphin House in Dublin. Installation is at an advanced stage and will be completed shortly. The upgrading of video facilities in Dundalk Courthouse is also planned. Furthermore, space has been made available in Naas Courthouse for the provision of a vulnerable witness suite. </p>  <p>  In the last two years there has been significant investment in courtroom technology and new courthouse facilities in seven locations around the country: Cork (Anglesea Street), Limerick (Mulgrave Street), Waterford, Wexford, Mullingar, Letterkenny and Drogheda. The new or refurbished courthouses in these locations have all been provided with dedicated facilities for the victims of crime. They have also been equipped with video technology to allow witnesses to appear remotely by video. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that during 2018 the video technology in the Criminal Courts of Justice in Parkgate Street in Dublin was refreshed in 14 courtrooms. Additional video technology was provided in Kilkenny Courthouse and the facilities in Tullamore Courthouse were also upgraded. Space was made available at Carlow Courthouse for a vulnerable witness suite. Overall there was a 49% increase in the number of courtrooms provided with video-conferencing in 2018, bringing the total number to 58, and the Courts Service will continue to invest in facilities and technology for victims of crime going forward.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may also be aware, the Domestic Violence Act 2018 was commenced on 1 January 2019. Section 25 of the 2018 Act provides for victims of domestic violence to give evidence by live television link, both in civil cases and in criminal cases for breaches of orders, so as to avoid the risk of intimidation by the perpetrator or an associate. Evidence given by live television link shall be video-recorded or audio-recorded. Section 25(3) of the 2018 Act provides that where live television link facilities are not in operation in a circuit court or district court district, and the court considers it desirable that evidence be given in this manner, the court may order the transfer of the proceedings to a circuit or district court district where those television link facilities are in operation. </p></reply>

The CJOH responds to the need for improved data interoperability which has been a long-standing objective of the criminal justice system and has been recommended in a range of internal and external reviews. </p>  <p>  It will provide a centralised facility to allow for data to be (i) exchanged between the existing ICT systems in the criminal justice agencies and (ii) accessed in an anonymised format for the purposes of analysis and developing evidence-based policy. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that by the end of 2019 the CJOH will start sharing defined sets of data between relevant CJS agencies in order to improve service delivery.  This constitutes the first phase of this project.  Any further phases will be the subject of analysis and evaluation prior to going ahead.</p>  <p>  The project is led by my Department in collaboration with the following agencies: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, The Courts Service, Irish Prisons Service, The Probation Service, the Legal Aid Board, Office of the DPP, Forensic Science Ireland, the Policing Authority, and Irish Youth Justice Service. The CSO is already involved with several of these agencies on data projects, including data quality enhancements, and the Programme is also engaging with the CSO on data modelling and the anonymisation process. </p>  <p>  In line with data protection law, the sharing of personal data between the relevant agencies is necessary and proportionate to the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences and to execute criminal penalties.  A Data Sub-Committee of the project, in consultation with Data Protection Officers from the Department and the relevant agencies, oversees compliance with the Data Protection Act 2018, the Law Enforcement Directive and GDPR as applicable. In accordance with the Act, a Joint Controller and Controller/Processor agreement will be put in place. </p></reply>

I have no plans to introduce a similar Bill, as the issues regarding access to children by grandparents, which the Rights of Grandparents Bill 2013 attempted to deal with, were subsequently addressed by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. </p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 is a child&ndash;centred Act which addresses the rights of children to legal security, to the care of their parents and important adults in their lives, and to equality before the law.  These reforms in family law recognise the crucial role of parents and other relatives, including grandparents, in a child's life. </p>  <p>  The 2015 Act extensively amended the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 in relation to guardianship, custody and access.  A grandparent or other relative may apply to court for custody of a child where he or she is an adult who has undertaken the child&rsquo;s day to day care for more than 12 months and the child has no parent or guardian willing or able to act as guardian.  The 2015 Act has also made it easier for relatives of a child, such as grandparents, to apply to court under section 11B of the 1964 Act to have access to children.  </p>  <p>  Section 25 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child. </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court to take into account in any proceedings where access to a child is in question.  It is a matter for the courts, when making decisions on access, to determine the best interests of the child and to decide whether or not to make an order regarding access to the child.</p></reply>

The changes were considered and approved, in the light of two years' experience in the operation of the scheme.  They were notified to barristers and solicitors by the Legal Aid Board at the end of January 2019.  </p><p>As outlined in the reply to Questions 299 and 300 of 19 February, the adjustments to the Legal Aid Board fees do not constitute an overall review of the terms and conditions for legal aid under Abhaile.  As the Deputy is aware from previous replies, the normal fees for a PIP or solicitor for a defended legal aid case under Abhaile remain unchanged.  There has been no change to the eligibility criteria for borrowers, and no change to the provision of legal aid under Abhaile free of charge to the borrower. </p><p>As previously outlined, in relation to representation by counsel: a borrower will continue to be represented in s.115A cases by a personal insolvency practitioner, a solicitor, and as needed, by junior and senior counsel. </p><p>The Board has indicated that barristers will not be approved <i>automatically</i>in every case.  There is no other area of civil legal aid where that is the case &ndash; and it is obvious that it may not always be necessary to approve counsel, for example, in a personal insolvency review case which is undefended. </p><p>However, the revised terms and conditions set out by the Legal Aid Board expressly indicate that in personal insolvency review cases, junior and (as needed) senior counsel will continue to be approved &lsquo;where there are legal complexities that require the involvement of counsel&rsquo; and this is expressly explained as including where a creditor raises legal issues that need to be argued by a barrister in court.  Counsel may also be approved on a case by case basis if there are exceptional circumstances, at the Board&rsquo;s discretion.  </p><p>Many personal insolvency review cases raise complex questions of law.  I and my Department are fully aware of the nature of the cases brought and decided over the past three years. Indeed, in January this year, on the launch of the Abhaile second year Report, I specifically underlined the priority that I attach to the good work being done under Abhaile, and to ensuring that the personal insolvency review can function effectively.</p><p>As outlined in the reply of 19 February, two reasonable changes are being introduced to the fees payable for all professionals.  First, the full fee will not be payable in undefended cases, where no creditor opposes the court review.  Secondly, personal insolvency cases often involve parallel applications by both partners, where a couple has the same home mortgage.  In practice, the vast majority of parallel applications are treated by the courts as one single case.  There is no reason for taxpayers to cover two full fees in such cases, and they will be payable at a full fee for one spouse and a reduced (10%) fee for the second spouse, representing the actual extra work involved. </p><p>These are manifestly reasonable changes. </p><p>Finally, barristers&rsquo; fixed fees are being reduced, but only to bring them into line with fees payable in other areas of civil legal aid where complex legal or procedural issues also arise.</p></reply>

This project also delivered new or refurbished courthouses at Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, Letterkenny and Drogheda.  All seven courthouse were procured as part of a single project with a total capital value of approximately &euro;150 million excluding VAT.  The capital value of Mullingar Courthouse was approximately &euro;14 million excluding VAT.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has further advised that Public Private Partnership projects are paid for by means of a Unitary Charge over a 25 year period after construction.  The Unitary Charge for the Courts PPP Bundle project includes payment for a range of services over the 25 year period in addition to repaying the capital cost of construction.  The Courts Service has informed me that there has been no change in the annual Unitary Charge since the project agreement was signed.  There has been an additional &euro;1.36 million excluding VAT in capital expenditure incurred across the entire bundle in respect of changes/additions to specifications sought by court users and additional archaeology costs incurred during the construction phase and this equates to less than 1% of the capital cost.  Discussions have yet to conclude concerning a number of claims and these are expected to conclude by the end of March 2019.</p></reply>

I understand, however, that the Commissioner is continuing to look at establishing an improved insurance fraud investigative capacity within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), taking account of available resources and competing demands.</p><p>I have previously outlined the considerable progress that has been made in enhancing the level of engagement and cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the insurance industry in relation to combating insurance fraud.  Arising from the cost of insurance review, the GNECB and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum have committed to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues concerning insurance fraud.  I welcome this enhanced co-operation, which will be very important in tackling the issue of fraudulent claims.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.670.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600063#WRM01400"><p>International Trade Policy is a competence of the European Commission under the EU Treaties and defined as the Common Commercial Policy. Under this architecture the Commission makes legislative proposals concerning trade defence and engages with Member States through various Committees, including the Trade Defence Instruments Committee where Member States vote to support or oppose the measures proposed by the Commission. </p><p>Following a complaint by the European Biodiesel Board on behalf of EU producers, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into imports of Argentine biodiesel on 31 January 2018. The Commission issued its final subsidy determination on 3 December 2018, finding that the Government of Argentina provided certain subsidies to its biodiesel industry and that such measures posed a threat of injury to the EU biodiesel industry. To regulate the importation of subsidized Argentine biodiesel into the EU and level the playing field for EU biodiesel manufacturers, the Commission recommended the imposition of definitive <i>ad valorem</i>anti-subsidy duties on imports of Argentine biodiesel of between 25% and 33.4%. In response, Argentine exporters offered a voluntary price undertaking proposal consisting of a Minimum Import Price (MIP) applicable to all Argentine biodiesel imports to the EU below a specified annual threshold; imports above that threshold would be subject to the EU&rsquo;s anti-subsidy duties.</p><p>At a meeting of the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, chaired by the Commission and representative of all Member States, on 30 January 2019, Member States voted to accept the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to introduce anti-subsidy measures on imports of Argentine biodiesel. Member States also voted to accept the voluntary price undertaking proposed by the Argentine exporters. The measures entered into force on 13 February 2019 (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/244 of 11 February 2019 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina). </p><p>The Minimum Import Price will be calculated on the basis of the international price of soybean oil, to which a fixed amount will be added. The Commission will monitor the situation on a quarterly basis, adjusting the MIP as necessary and ensuring that the undertaking given is not violated. Any breach of the undertaking will result in its withdrawal and the full application of the anti-subsidy duties.</p><p>The annual threshold for tariff-free imports of biodiesel from Argentina has been set at a volume roughly corresponding to its overall market performance and at around 10% of the average annual EU consumption of biodiesel between 2014 and 2017. While this is an annual allocation, Argentina has undertaken not to issue more than 37% of export certificates in any quarter in an effort so as not to create an imbalance in trade flows. Imports will be monitored by the European Commission in conjunction with Member States&rsquo; Customs authorities. Once this threshold has been exceeded, imports of Argentine biodiesel will be subject to the anti-subsidy duties laid out in the aforementioned Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/244.</p><p>Insofar as &lsquo;EU levies on domestic biofuels&rsquo; are concerned, I assume the Deputy is referring to a sustainability premium, and my Department remains in dialogue with the European Commission and colleague Member States on the interplay of this premium with this dossier.</p><p>The Commission considers that the combination of the MIP with the proposed annual level plus the <i>ad valorem</i>duty applicable to imports of biodiesel exceeding the annual level will offset any injurious effects to the EU biodiesel industry resulting from the subsidisation of Argentine exports. </p><p>As my Department has had ongoing engagement with Irish producers of biodiesel and the European Biodiesel Board, in relation to this case, as well as to the earlier related anti-dumping investigation (now terminated), we are fully seized of their interests in these matters.</p><p>On balance, I am satisfied that industry&rsquo;s concerns have been addressed by the price undertaking and anti-subsidy duties which entered into force on 13 February. I am further satisfied that these measures do not put EU manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and that they are WTO-compliant. However, my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and to make known to the European Commission any issues encountered by Irish producers as a result of these measures.</p></reply>

An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. Additional resources have also been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>Work continues on the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates.

The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) for the purposes of granting an employment permit.</p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs, the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas) and co-ordinated by the National Skills Council, the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report in tandem with a public consultation process.  </p>  <p>  Jockeys are currently included on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL).  In order to remove a skill from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and-or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  </p>  <p>  A review of the lists of occupations for employment permits is currently being finalised with a further review to take place in the second half of the year. A submission received from the horse racing industry is being considered as part of the review.   </p></reply>

That Act was repealed and replaced by the Companies Act 2014, which came into operation on 1 June 2015.  </p>  <p>  In October 2017, the Government decided to establish the ODCE as an agency, rather than an Office of the Department, with a commission type structure. It also decided that the new agency should be better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, on 4 December 2018, the Government gave effect to that Decision by approving, and publishing, the General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill.  As well as establishing the ODCE as an agency, with a commission structure, the Scheme also introduces some new investigative tools, supervisory powers with respect to liquidators, and measures designed to enhance corporate transparency. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme is currently subject to Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, which is being undertaken by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Subject to the duration and outcome of that Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, the General Scheme is scheduled for priority drafting, with a view to enactment by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 also established the Company Law Review Group on a statutory basis. Those provisions are now contained in Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014 and there are no plans to amend them. </p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and ongoing work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to: </p>  <p>1.  What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>2.  What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist.   On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation.

The first of these building blocks is a clear governance and accountability framework. As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the establishment of a HSE Board, the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, 9 CHOs and 7 Hospital Groups were established on an administrative basis in recent years to plan and deliver community and acute care services respectively. However, these structures are not geographically aligned and there is broad consensus that having separate and un-aligned structures for acute and community care impedes the development of a more integrated health service as envisaged under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.</p>  <p>  To address these issues, the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommends the geographic alignment of community healthcare organisations (CHOs) and hospital groups to support population based health planning and delivery, the design of the new regional bodies and ultimately the introduction of a form of regional health resource allocation. To support decisions on geographic alignment, the Sl&aacute;intecare report further recommends &ldquo;further analysis and consultation &hellip;to identify how alignment can best be achieved with minimal disruption to key structures including at community healthcare network level&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy, I am committed to the development of a new system of health structures and governance as called for in the Sl&aacute;intecare report. The Strategy sets out a number of actions that will lead to the development of a new system of health structures and governance comprising a leaner national centre with responsibility for national planning, strategy and standard setting, complemented by regional integrated care organisations with responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at a regional level. </p>  <p>  In line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report recommendation, my Department undertook a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups in 2018. In addition, my Department has carried out further detailed analysis work to determine the optimal geographical alignment of CHOs and Hospital Groups which can be achieved with minimal disruption, and which will ultimately be the geographical areas of the proposed new regional integrated care organisations. My Department is finalising proposals in this regard, and I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p></reply>

In order to allow full consideration of these issues, and so that the publication of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill would not be delayed, it was decided that the best option would be to provide for safe access to health services in a separate companion piece of legislation in 2019.  </p>  <p>  Government approval for this approach was received in September 2018. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working with the Office of the Attorney General on this legislation with a view to having a General Scheme drafted by the summer.</p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland, following issues which had emerged in relation to the CervicalCheck screening programme. </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results.  However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year.  This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. </p>  <p>  The HSE also advises that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years.  Due to this very fact, it is important that any woman of screening age attends for cervical screening each and every time she is invited to participate.  The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women.</p></reply>

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, where necessary, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, my Department requested that consideration be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. As a result, HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives. Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and, to date, no major issues have been identified through this process.</p></reply>

Stage 1 consists of a full tender and contract for Phase A works (below ground, including basement works) on the basis of a detailed design, and a tender for Phase B works (the main above ground works) on the basis of a preliminary 1st stage design with an approximate and remeasurable bill of quantities reflecting the preliminary 1st stage design.  Stage 2 consists of the completion of the detailed design for the above ground Phase B works, with a full bill of quantities priced at the Stage 1 preliminary design tendered rates.  This approach allowed the early phases of work to commence on site while also allowing for the detail of later phases to be finalised and agreed, resulting in the determination of a Guaranteed Maximum Price prior to the instruction to proceed with the main Phase B works.  </p>  <p>  Contract tenders were received from the main contractor, mechanical and electrical installation contractors and lift contractors in October 2016.  The most competitive tender sum, excluding VAT, was &euro;637m in total, of which &euro;432m applied to the main contractor.  Following completion of the Guaranteed Maximum Price Process (GMP) in November 2018, the total adjusted GMP construction budget is &euro;890m, of which &euro;556m applies to the main contractor. </p>  <p>  As the particular details regarding material changes to the foundations and underground car park layout and other associated site works are operational matters, I have asked the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to reply to you directly, as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the survey was to measure employee sentiment and engagement within the publicly funded Health Sector.  I understand that within the National Ambulance Service there was a 50% response rate. </p>  <p>  As with all surveys, it raised a number of both positive and negative results.  These results have prompted the National Ambulance Service to take a range of measures to address the areas where improvements could be made.  </p>  <p>  I am clear that bullying or harassment in any workplace must not be tolerated and any such instance must be addressed in accordance with the appropriate grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures.  Any employee who experiences or witnesses work place bullying or harassment should be aware that they can report these instances under the Dignity at Work Policy for the Health Service.</p>  <p>  The NAS is also developing anti bullying work place initiatives in line with the Positive Workplace Programme and bespoke sessions for the NAS are currently in development.  Staff Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing initiatives and programmes are ongoing in the NAS as part of Healthy Ireland including significant focus on staff health initiatives such as mental wellbeing, physical activity, health checks and improving the workplace environment.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other ongoing programmes and initiatives being undertaken and supported by the National Ambulance Service.  For example, a number of NAS managers across the country have undertaken Leadership Development Programmes including Continuous Quality Improvement courses using the Lean Sigma process.</p>  <p>  The NAS has also established a National Staff Engagement Forum as well as local Engagement Networks.  The role of the Forum is to create a space for conversations about what matters to staff in terms of engagement and to gather suggestions on how to improve it by building on existing approaches and continually looking for new ways to engage staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NAS has strengthened representative bodies and increased the number of NAS staff representation in order to provide further regular and scheduled discussion around areas such as improvement in internal and upward communication, raising awareness around dignity at work issues, and health and wellbeing initiatives.</p></reply>

Unite and FORSA also represent some ambulance grades.  As a result, the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of those unions.  However, the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (NASRA) is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  </p>  <p>  Whilst individuals have a right to membership of any trade union, if they choose to join an association which is not recognised by their employer, such membership is not facilitated by their employer. This means that the HSE does not facilitate the deduction of union subscriptions for this particular Association.  </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken industrial action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  I have asked my Department to engage with the HSE to explore ways forward and see if we can progress a resolution to this dispute.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.943.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600067#WRQ06100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362, 377 and 397 together.</p>  <p>  The Deputies have raised a number of issues in relation to a Health Sector National Staff Survey which was carried out in 2016.  The purpose of the survey was to measure employee sentiment and engagement within the publicly funded Health Sector.  I understand that within the National Ambulance Service there was a 50% response rate. </p>  <p>  As with all surveys, it raised a number of both positive and negative results.  These results have prompted the National Ambulance Service to take a range of measures to address the areas where improvements could be made.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of ongoing programmes and initiatives being undertaken and supported by the National Ambulance Service.  For example, a number of NAS managers across the country have undertaken Leadership Development Programmes including Continuous Quality Improvement courses using the Lean Sigma process.</p>  <p>  The NAS is also developing anti bullying work place initiatives in line with the Positive Workplace Programme and bespoke sessions for the NAS are currently in development.  Staff Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing initiatives and programmes are ongoing in the NAS as part of Healthy Ireland including significant focus on staff health initiatives such as mental wellbeing, physical activity, health checks and improving the workplace environment. </p>  <p>  I will now move to discuss the PNA/NASRA dispute.  As I have stated before, SIPTU is the main union recognised by the HSE and has negotiating rights for frontline ambulance grades employed by the Executive.  Unite and FORSA also represent some ambulance grades.  As a result, the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of those unions.  However, the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (NASRA) is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  </p>  <p>  Whilst individuals have a right to membership of any trade union, if they choose to join an association which is not recognised by their employer, such membership is not facilitated by their employer. This means that the HSE does not facilitate the deduction of union subscriptions for this particular Association.  </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken industrial action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  I have asked my Department to engage with the HSE to explore ways forward to see if we can progress a resolution to this dispute.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-26a.946.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600067#WRQ06150"><p>On 28 April 2018, I made the decision to provide for a free out of cycle smear test for any woman who was concerned, where her GP felt she should have a further test as part of her reassurance. </p>  <p>  My Department's advice in this regard was reflected in the press statement issued on the 28 April which said that, &ldquo;for any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test and where her GP feels she should have a further test as part of her reassurance, the Minister has asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements, including payment provision. These arrangements will be confirmed next week."   </p>  <p>  A fee to provide for this free repeat smear was subsequently agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation, and welcomed by TDs across the D&aacute;il and by GP representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Neither I nor my officials received advice that recommended against these tests in advance of the decision.  I understand that, subsequent to the decision, on foot of contact by the Department, concerns were raised by the National Screening Service, but these failed to recognise the circumstances of the unfolding crisis in the programme. Were it not for these circumstances, it would never have been necessary to contemplate such a step in the ordinary course of the operation of the screening programme. The decision cannot be separated from the reality that general practitioners, in difficult circumstances, were dealing with large numbers of worried patients as a result of the issues which came into the public domain over the course of Thursday and Friday, 26th and 27th of April. It was important that GPs be supported while they awaited supporting information to be developed and disseminated by CervicalCheck. The alternative, i.e. that the State failed to recognise the reality of patients presenting in this way to GPs or the State refused to pay for such smears, would have been untenable in the circumstances.</p></reply>

The Pathfinder<br /><br />team should develop mandatory protocols which will work to safeguard young<br /><br />people against potential changes in policy that could negatively impact on youth<br /><br />mental health<br /><br />1.2 - Policies involving young people should be published in simple, straightforward<br /><br />language that young people can understand<br /><br />1.3 - A process of youth consultation should be carried out when designing mental<br /><br />health and other support services and facilities for young people<br /><br />1.4 - An independent National Youth Mental Health Advocacy and Information<br /><br />Service should be established. Consultation should be informed by children and<br /><br />young people and should include the HSE, which is developing a tender for a<br /><br />Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) youth advocacy pilot.</td><td>Work has been advanced to establish a Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Team. A submission was created on behalf of the Secretary General of the Department of Health for submission to DPER. Since then there has been considerable communication and work performed in addressing outstanding governance, staffing and funding issues. Activities are not yet complete in fully developing  and rolling out a pathfinder unit, but work is on-going. <br /><br />Policies involving young people are issued to the young people&rsquo;s forum in DCYA for review prior to publication.<br /><br />This is to be a part of the Pathfinder project once agreed.<br /><br />A pilot adult inpatient advocacy service is being rolled out in St Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital and the HSE will use the learning&rsquo;s from this pilot to determine how best to establish a young advocacy service. Work has been completed to determine the merits of establishing the advocacy service as (i)a separate structure independent of the HSE, (ii) a structure within the Child Ombudsman or indeed (iii) a new NGO agency. A draft business plan has been drafted and data from the HSE pilot will provide a template for how best to proceed in an Irish context.  </td></tr><tr><td>Awareness and Training<br /><br />2.1  - A series of sustained and evidence based awareness campaigns should be<br /><br />developed, specifically targeted at children and young people, to improve mental<br /><br />health, emotional literacy, build resilience, and aid the development of coping<br /><br />mechanisms<br /><br />2.2 - Sustained, quality-assured and evidenced-based training programmes should be<br /><br />funded to provide support to individuals in the public, voluntary and community<br /><br />sectors who have contact with young people so that those trained might be in a<br /><br />better position to promote positive mental health</td><td>The HSE have been examining International awareness initiatives that might be applicable in this jurisdiction. <br /><br /><div>Little Things Mental Health Campaign for 2nd level students:</div>HSE Mental Health has been running the Little Things Campaign since 2014 to promote protection and improvement of mental health for the whole population. The campaign focuses on 9 protective factors that can help build resilience and improve  mental health and wellbeing. There were 87,000 followers of Little things on social media in 2017. There were 3.2m visits to yourmentalhealth.ie between 2014 and 2017.<br /><br />In 2017 work commenced on adapting the Little Things Campaign to tailor the messaging and make it more relevant to young people, who are also listed within Connecting for Life as a priority group. Using research conducted by online youth mental health service, ReachOut.com, which highlighted key areas of stress for young people the HSE identified 6 issues to include in the new campaign; Exams, Sleep, Digital devices and Bottling up your feelings,  Relationships and Image. <br /><br />Imagery and messaging has been developed for 4 of the key areas and will be made available as poser packs to schools, youth and sports clubs around the country. The messaging has been developed to inform young people about the things they can do to reduce stress and anxiety. <br /><br />The campaign will be promoted on Radio, Social Media and through Digital ads targeting young people through relevant channels. We will be signposting to yourmenalhealth.ie for more information on the topics and will also promote the Childline text and phone option for any young person that might need immediate support. Content on all 6 issues, developed in partnership with SpunOut will also be hosted on ymh.ie.<br /><br /><div>HSE/USI ReCharge Mental Health Campaign for 3rd Level Students:</div>HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign is due to be launched on the 12th of November in University College Cork.  The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie. USI is the national representative body for 374,000 students in 3rd level education and also receive funding from the HSE to provide training courses in SafeTALK, ASIST<br /><br />Mental Health First Aid<br /><br />Mental Health First Aid training for young people  <br /><br />HSE Mental Health funds Mental Health First Aid to deliver courses to various target groups. Participants learn the signs and symptoms of mental health problems and what sort of help has been shown by research to be effective. The training has been shown to improve attitudes towards people with mental health difficulties, reduce stigma, improve knowledge, and improve people&rsquo;s confidence in providing help and likelihood to advise people to seek professional help. Over 2000 individuals and professionals have been trained in 2018 and the training will continue in 2019.<br /><br />Perinatal Training<br /><br />The HSEs Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Services Model of Care was launched on 30.11.2017. Its implementation is now being directed and overseen by the Clinical Lead and Programme Manager. Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Teams are being recruited for the maternity hospital/service hub in each of the six Hospital Groups. Two of the teams are now operational. As part of this implementation a mental health midwife is also being recruited for each of the maternity hospitals/units with two for the four larger services, those with over 8,000 deliveries per year. Apart from the perinatal psychiatrists heading up each specialist hub team who are directly trained in the speciality, all other staff will require training in perinatal mental health. The National Implementation and Oversight Group is in the process of drafting a training document and in the meantime all newly recruited staff are being provided with the appropriate induction and training.</td></tr><tr><td>National Telephone Line <br /><br />3.1 - The Taskforce recommends increased investment in age-appropriate, scalable digital youth mental health supports in conjunction with existing providers to ensure all young people ages 0-25 have access to an active listening service and dynamic signposting tool.</td><td>HSE Mental Health has sought to advance the establishment and operation of a single and stand-alone National Mental Health Service Telephone Contact Facility to effectively manage mental health service related queries emerging from the community.  This service will operate on a 24/7 basis and will encompass <br /><br />(i) the provision of information about, and direction of callers to, the most appropriate national and local pathway(s) to care specific to the query raised, and (ii) where possible the direct transfer of callers to the most appropriate existing helpline partners and/or services as required.<br /><br />Resource allocation has been agreed between HSE Mental Health and the National Ambulance Service (NAS) have recruited new NAS call takers. Training of call takers has commenced and will last for 14 weeks.  An Expression of Interest is being sought for a suitably qualified mental health specialist to join the clinical hub of the NAS. At present, a go live date of Q3 2019 is envisioned.</td></tr><tr><td>E-Mental Health Strategy<br /><br />4.1 - Families, guardians and carers should be supported in parenting children and young people through the provision of universal, quality-assured and evidence-based parenting information and support programmes.<br /><br />4.2 - Evidence-based information, interventions and signposting tools about mental<br /><br />health should be included into routine perinatal care services.</td><td>The HSE launched &lsquo;yourmentalhealth.ie&rsquo; last year. This website provides advice, information and support services for mental health and wellbeing.<br /><br />Crisis textline<br /><br />The HSE is exploring how to best deliver an active listening service (Live Chat, Instant Messaging &amp;amp; SMS)<br /><br />HSE Mental Health has engaged with leading US-based provider of instant text messaging support services Crisis Text Line with a view to establishing their service in Ireland.  The board of Crisis Text Line has approved the application to extend service licensing arrangements to Ireland.  HSE is working in close collaboration with an existing service partner, SpunOut.ie/Community Creations, to act as the host/incubator organisation for the service on a pilot basis with contractual and service level arrangement negotiations now complete. The risk assessment of the service has been undertaken by SpunOut.ie/Community Creations.  A project manager has been employed and the project plan is being developed and will be complete by mid-February 2019.  <br /><br />Telepsychiatry  Pilots<br /><br />Following a decision of the Project Steering Committee in January 2019, two telepsychiatry pilots are now being undertaken.  These pilots encompass the following: <br /><br />(1)Remote consults to address CAMHS waiting lists.<br /><br />(2)Remote consults on national adolescent addiction and substance abuse service.<br /><br />It is also envisaged that a third pilot may be undertaken to assist reducing remote access and creating additional capacity and remote team consultations.</td></tr><tr><td>Schools And Youth Mental Health<br /><br />5.1 - The Department of Education and Skills should support teaching professionals<br /><br />in schools and centres for education with the knowledge and skills to understand<br /><br />their role in supporting young people with mental health issues and how to access<br /><br />information about services and supports available to them.<br /><br />5.2 - Principals and teachers should be supported to implement the wellbeing junior cycle curriculum.</td><td>The Department of Education have recently made changes to the Junior Cycle Wellbeing Curriculum. Additional hours have been allocated to mental health and awareness. <br /><br />There are now 400 hours of Wellbeing education in the Junior Cycle curriculum. Indicators of wellbeing are embedded into all subjects.  A key strength of the these reforms is that young people will write up a report, report back on their learning, and earn a certificate. Parents can look at schools which perform well in wellbeing league tables.</td></tr><tr><td>Third level supports<br /><br />6.1 - The current provision of counselling and mental health supports in higher level institutions should be maintained and enhanced<br /><br />6.2 - The Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills should develop appropriate indicators to assess student experience in higher education in the system performance framework for higher education<br /><br />6.3 - Prioritise the implementation of recommendations contained in &ldquo;Mental Health Matters&rdquo;</td><td>The Department continues to support PCHEI with provision of additional counselling supports in third level institutions, though final authority rests with the Department of Education and Skill, as third level institutions are educational establishments. An evaluation piece is needed and HEI will provide input as to what additional counselling might be required before a final submission will be made.<br /><br />Department of Education have agreed a package of &euro;57 million in additional current funding will be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019 alongside &euro;41 million additional funding for pay deals and pensions in the sector. This will fund provision for 3,500 additional places, initiatives to support innovation and performance awards, teaching and learning capacity, 1,000 additional places on Springboard+, research funds for Institutes of Technology/TUs, part-time and flexible learning. There will be also be a strengthening of counselling services in higher education. Total funding in higher education will be &euro;337m higher in 2019 than in 2016 (current funding increase of &euro;260m since 2016 and capital funding increase of &euro;79m since 2016). Capital investment of &euro;150 million will also be allocated to the higher education, further education and training and research sectors in 2019.<br /><br />HSE Mental Health is also funding a new Mental Health awareness campaign with USI to target third level education students. This campaign was launched on the 12 November 2018 in University College Cork.  The HSE funding has been used to create a new campaign logo and tagline, three new posters to address the effects that Alcohol, Sleep and Exams can have on mental health and ways to help manage any stress related to those issues. A new leaflet with more information on protective factors and ways to seek help will also be produced as well as content on both USI.ie and yourmentalhealth.ie. USI is the national representative body for 374,000 students in 3rd level education and also receive funding from the HSE to provide training courses in SafeTALK, ASIST</td></tr><tr><td>Community Supports<br /><br />7.1 - The Task Force recommends that local government work with relevant agencies, youth groups and community groups to provide safe, &lsquo;youth friendly&rsquo; spaces, sporting and cultural facilities that are conducive to promoting good mental health. These should include the provision of pleasant spaces and facilities for young people to access qualified health and mental health care in the community.<br /><br />Evidence-based, quality-assured training in youth mental health should available to all individuals working with young people in the community</td><td>The provision of Youth Friendly Spaces in community settings is a high priority for local government.  Working with youth groups and community groups, service providers have been asked to try to include youth friendly spaces so that mental health can be supported. The thrust of Government policy has been towards enhancing mental health support in the  community since &lsquo;A Vision For Change&rsquo; was adopted in 2006. This policy will be continued when the refreshed policy is published later this year.</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility and Alignment<br /><br />8.1 - Pathfinder should carry out a detailed assessment of the services and supports currently available in relation to youth mental health, in order to identify gaps in service provision and to scope what improvements could be achieved through greater coordination<br /><br />8.2 - The HSE should improve provision of mental health supports to young people at the primary care level to reduce the pressure on the tertiary referral services and improve waiting times<br /><br />8.3 - The HSE should establish a National Lead for Youth Mental Health and a Lead for Youth Mental Health in each Community Health Organisation (CHO) to co-ordinate the provision of services and address gaps in service provision, including out of hours services. The CHO Leads will liaise with relevant agencies to develop appropriate communication protocols, standardised assessment processes and coordination of service provision. This joint working will bring together expert stakeholders to identify and address potential blocks to service provision and seek to reduce current wait times nationally with the introduction of other more appropriate interventions in primary care.</td><td>Assessments of current services are being discussed by TUSLA as part of their service provision in agreement with DCYA. They have initially suggested that overview of services would need to take place for all of their services, but that this would need to include mental health services and that therefore they may be in a position to complete this recommendation. I will have more detail once I meet with Tusla. <br /><br />Part of the recommendation refers to recruitment of HSE leads but the job specifications for full time staff are hard to define. At a recent meeting with HSE, Task Force representatives and NGO sector it was agreed to wait for the establishment of Pathfinder team to work on specific job specifications for the recommended posts.</td></tr><tr><td>Consent Issues<br /><br />9.1 - Legislation should be published to give effect to the recommendations of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act, 2001 with regard to children, including reforming the consent provisions, to allow young people under 18 direct access to mental health services</td><td>There are on-going discussions and legislative work in the Department of Health regarding amending the legislation to allow children under 16 access mental health services without the need to have parental consent. Heads of Bill is currently being progressed.</td></tr><tr><td>Improving Knowledge<br /><br />10.1 - A funded strategic national research programme on youth mental health will be developed<br /><br />10.2 - International sources of funding (for example from European Union or philanthropic organisations) should be leveraged to enhance this research strategy on youth mental health research</td><td>There have been discussion with the HRB on how best to approach these recommendations. There will be a need for new additional funding and this will need to be tied in the with the creation of the Pathfinder Team who will have responsibility to create structures for administering grants and creating criteria for issuing research funding. <br /><br />PRIMERA (Promoting Research and Innovation in Mental hEalth seRvices for fAmilies) programme of research, funded by the HSE, is investigating how best to deliver mental health services and interventions to families where a parent has a diagnosed mental illness. Recent years have seen growing recognition of the importance of parental mental health and the need for more integrated and effective service responses to parents with mental illness and their children (Wilson et al., 2010; HSE, 2015). This research aims to:<br /><br />1.To identify mental health services in Ireland that currently deliver, or are interested in developing and delivering family-focused intervention(s) for families where a parent has a diagnosed mental health problem (and their children aged 0-18years). <br /><br />2.To subsequently investigate in more detail the implementation and effectiveness of selected interventions in order to inform a &lsquo;think family&rsquo; care delivery agenda in Ireland (and internationally).</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Patients in Ireland can seek to be referred to another EU/EEA member state, including the UK,  for medical treatment that is available in the public health service in Ireland. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the EU/EEA member state they choose to receive the service in. The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself, and all other costs associated with accessing care abroad, including travel costs, under the CBD are not reimbursed by the HSE. </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to introduce financial assistance for travel costs incurred under the CBD. </p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that at present there are no changes to patient care in the UK under the CBD, as the UK continues to be a full member of the EU. Indeed until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full Member with all of its existing rights and obligations.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Irish and UK Governments are committed to maintaining access to health services currently facilitated by the Common Travel Area for both Irish and UK residents to ensure that, insofar as possible, there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a Cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis post-Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government's 'Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019' published last Friday contains provisions to allow me to make Orders and Regulations to enable necessary healthcare arrangements to be maintained between Ireland and the UK in a no-deal scenario, including those existing arrangements which enable access to health services in the UK for persons in the State. </p></reply>

This means that the product manufacturers have not applied for an authorisation to market their products as medicinal products. This is because these products are unlikely to meet the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that authorised medicines must meet before being placed on the market, nor are the production processes likely to meet the same level of regulatory requirements as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. </p><p>However, whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important that patients and prescribers can be assured, as far as possible, of the quality of these products. Department officials are working to ensure that appropriate procedures are put in place to facilitate this requirement in relation to cannabis-based products that will be permitted for medical use in Ireland.</p><p><b>Access to Medical Cannabis</b></p><p>Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is clearly critical in establishing the access programme. To the Department&rsquo;s knowledge only two countries, Canada and the Netherlands, currently permit export of such cannabis products, which meet acceptable quality control standards, beyond their borders. The Netherlands permits exports of cannabis dried herb, but does not permit commercial export of their oil-based cannabis formulations, which is the formulation preferred by the clinical community.</p><p>Department officials are working intensively on finding solutions to the supply of appropriate quality assured products for Irish patients, in parallel to their ongoing work on other significant projects. Department of Health officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in other countries, including Denmark, UK and Canada.</p><p>However, the Department of Health has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel companies to supply their products to the Irish market.</p><p><b>Ministerial Licence</b></p><p>Pending full operation of the Access Programme, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients.  Thirty-two licences have now been granted in respect of sixteen individual patients.</p><p>As the Deputy has stated, until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed product from a pharmacy in The Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription. </p><p>It is intended that the Ministerial licence application scheme will continue to operate in parallel with the Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, after the programme becomes operational, for exceptional cases only where there is an unmet clinical need.</p><p><b>Importation Licence:</b></p><p>One licence has been granted to an entity for the importation of products containing medical cannabis.</p><p><b>Department of Health website:</b></p><p>Information on the situation regarding medical cannabis is available on the Department of Health website. The medical cannabis section is continually updated. </p></reply>

The main goal of this monitoring activity is to facilitate the collection of additional information as early as possible to further elucidate the risk profile of products when used in clinical practice and to increase awareness about the safe and effective use of the medicines concerned. All newly authorised biological medicines including vaccines are subject to these additional monitoring requirements, usually for the first five years following authorisation and Gardasil 9 is being monitored in this way at EU and national level.</p>  <p>  As part of the system for monitoring the safety of medicinal products, the HPRA operates a spontaneous reporting system by which patients/consumers and healthcare professionals can report suspected adverse reactions through various reporting options available through the HPRA website (www.hpra.ie). All reports of suspected adverse reactions received by the HPRA are routinely transmitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) EudraVigilance (EV) database for inclusion in global signal detection activities. </p>  <p>  In December 2018 the Health Information and Quality Authority completed a health technology assessment (HTA) in relation to extending the national immunisation schedule to include the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination of boys.</p>  <p>  The HTA recommended that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys and the introduction of 9-valent HPV vaccine.  A policy decision has been made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys and introduce 9-valent HPV vaccine starting in September 2019.</p>  <p>  The National Immunisation Office are working towards a gender-neutral HPV programme, information on which will be available for parents and healthcare professionals in advance of the start of the gender-neutral programme.</p></reply>

This review, which concluded that the vaccine was safe, included Ireland-specific safety data from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  The HIQA economic model, which assessed the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine, required an estimate of the hospitalisation rate associated with HPV vaccination.

What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 14 February 2019. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my consent. I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgment. </p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and, until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

This enhanced direct and rapid access will improve clinical outcomes for the sickest children and young people. </p>  <p>  The helipad has been designed in close consultation with the National Ambulance Service Aeromedical Liaison Service who are responsible for providing helicopter services to hospitals. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board also consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps who are the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service.  </p>  <p>  When reviewing the alternatives with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps, they recommended against a ground helipad due to the constrained flight paths and obstacle clearance. Use of elevated landing sites on the roof of hospitals is widespread in the UK and Europe and many of the recently completed Paediatric hospitals have elevated helipads. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps is the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service. Air Corps helicopters comprising Augusta Westland AW139 can land on a raised landing site or the roof of a building which is designed and certified for such operations.  The Irish Coast Guard provides reserve support to the National Ambulance Service, when required, through its Sikorsky S92 search and rescue fleet primarily for search and rescue missions. The Sikorsky S92 helicopters are not licensed to land on helipads and, for access to the St. James's Campus, will land in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham from which patients will be transferred in an ambulance by road, as is current practice. </p>  <p>  The majority of patient transfers to the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals are completed by road. In any major emergency rescue in a rural area, a Sikorsky Helicopter will bring the patient to the nearest regional hospital for stabilisation resulting in an appropriately planned transfer to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  </p></reply>

There are socially excluded groups who experience extreme health inequalities.  Such groups include Travellers, homeless people, refugees and asylum seekers and people with addiction issues.  Inequalities in health are reflected in the mortality and morbidity rates of the population.  Rates of chronic diseases are another indicator of health inequalities. A social gradient is also apparent in mental health. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is developing an inclusion health policy which will sets out the department's approach to reducing health inequalities for socially excluded groups. The policy will move away from a silo approach and consider the many cross-cutting issues that affected social excluded groups, be that addiction, mental health, or physical health. It will address the social determinants of health and outline models to provide integrated and comprehensive healthcare services, in line with Slaintecare.</p>  <p>  The Department has undertaken significant measures across the health service to address the health needs of Travellers, including funding for the All Ireland Traveller Health Study. There is ongoing and extensive engagement with Traveller organisations on their health needs.    </p>  <p>  The Department provides funding in the region of &euro;10m per annum to the HSE for targeted measures to improve the health status of the Travelling community.  These include:</p>  <p>  - primary healthcare projects, counselling services, family support programmes and men's health projects; dedicated public health nurses and related staff;</p>  <p>  - mental health promotion and suicide prevention services in a culturally sensitive manner, to reduce the stigma associated with mental health.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;500,000 initiatives aimed at improving Traveller mental health is provided through the Dormant Accounts Fund. Additional funding for Traveller mental health initiatives is provided in the HSE National Service Plan 2019.  </p>  <p>  The provision of additional resources for Traveller health is a matter for consideration in the preparation of the Estimates for Budget 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) sets out over 30 actions to address the health needs of Travellers and Roma. The Department and the HSE report regularly on the implementation of these actions to the NTRIS steering group, chaired by Minister David Stanton. One of the NTRIS actions is for the HSE to develop and implement a detailed action plan to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.    </p>  <p>  As Minister for health promotion, I am fully committed to improving the health outcomes for Travellers and I look forward to receiving from the HSE its Traveller health action plan in due course.</p></reply>

To this effect, I recently launched the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) a targeted support of &euro;20 million for suckler farmers specifically aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production.  As well as clear environmental and climate benefits, the BEEP will provide farm gate investment at a time of market volatility and uncertainty relating to Brexit.  The pilot has been designed to be as straightforward as possible. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd. Also, it should be noted an additional &euro;23 million was secured for the ANC scheme in 2019.</p>  <p>  I am, however, very conscious that the beef sector is currently facing a difficult period.  I am deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate for the continued development of the sector.  According to National Farm Survey data, suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average. </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together. At the last Beef Round table, I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency and to support the sector through examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links in the supply chain, including Beef Producer Organisations. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders in relation to Beef Producer Organisations, which have the potential to help strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain. </p></reply>

Indeed, log prices have remained high throughout 2018 with standing timber prices for the first nine months of 2018 up by 34% for Coillte Teoranta and 20% for private sales over the same period in 2017.  Thus forest owners and managers have a significant incentive to move their harvested timber from the forest to the saw mill or timber processing factories so as to realise the value of their investment.</p><p>As my Department&rsquo;s Code of Best Forest Practice and Forest Biodiversity Guidelines allows, some wood is generally left onsite following harvesting operations in the form of deadwood and older retained trees.  Deadwood and old or veteran trees represent an important resource for biodiversity.  Decomposing wood provides a habitat for numerous species of plants and animals which might otherwise be absent from the forest.  A small amount of deadwood is normally left <i>in situ </i>after both thinning and final harvesting.  Deadwood can be left in the form of standing dead stems or naturally fallen trunks if present or as logs deliberately left behind on the forest floor.</p></reply>

The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff across a range of skill sets to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. </p>  <p>  In general, regarding staffing requirements, my Department will use a combination of options including recruitment, redeployment and temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary.  My Department continues to work with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service, to engage Veterinary Inspectors, Portal Inspectors, Plant Health Inspectors and Administrative support staff.  Mechanisms to temporarily redeploy experienced people within my Department have also been initiated and the engagement of contracted temporary service arrangements is also being progressed. </p>  <p>  The final staffing numbers to be engaged in response to Brexit contingencies will depend on the nature of Brexit and the trading relationship with the UK that ensues.  Should a hard Brexit be confirmed as the probable contingency to be addressed, my Department will, through the mechanisms I have outlined, have the scope to deploy appropriate levels of Phytosanitary and Veterinary Inspectors as may be required.  Overall, I remain confident that both the State and my Department will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time, be that at the end of March or any other point in the future.</p>  <p>  The deployment options being used by the Department are intended to be as flexible as possible, taking the inherent unpredictability of the situation and the need to be prepared for multiple contingencies into account. </p>  <p>  My Department will deploy in the region of 230 staff resources as part of its Brexit Response.  This number will comprise new recruits, redeployed staff and people on temporary contracts.</p>  <p>  Dublin Port will be staffed on a 24/7 basis.  Rosslare ports will operate on the basis of two shifts per day, based on ferry activity. </p>  <p>  All of these resource levels will be kept under review and will be adjusted in light of developments up to and post-29 March 2019. </p></reply>

The Scheme opened for applications on 28 March 2018 and it will remain open until 31st March 2020.  To date it has provided in excess of &euro;17m in finance to over 80 SMEs including 13 operating in the food sector.  Further information may be found via the following link: </p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed by my Department and DBEI in partnership with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and the European Investment Fund (EIF).  It will be delivered through participating finance providers and make up to &euro;300 million of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including farmers and the agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p><p>This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security.  It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution.</p><p>The loans will be competitively priced, will be for terms of 8-10 years and will support strategic long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  There is a minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs or &euro;50,000 for primary agriculture.  The maximum loan amount is &euro;3,000,000 and loans of under &euro;500,000 will be made on an unsecured basis.</p><p>There will be &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million available initially for farmers, within an overall agri-food package of &euro;120 million.  Should demand exceed these levels, this can be reviewed.</p><p>The Scheme features a two-stage application process whereby initial application is made through the SBCI website.  Successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number which can then be used in an application to one of the participating finance providers.  Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.  Further information including a FAQ document may be accessed on the DAFM website via the following link: .</p><p>SBCI recently issued an open call inviting banks and other lenders to become lending partners and this closed on 11 February.  SBCI advise that a period of due diligence, which will include the EIF, will now follow.  I have urged SBCI to operationalise the Scheme as soon as possible.  The Scheme will run for three years from its launch date and further announcements in this regard will be made shortly.</p></reply>

The Consultation attracted over 900 submissions which comprised a wide diversity of views.  These submissions have been published on my Department's website.</p><p>I carefully considered the issues raised during the public consultation process and following a detailed evaluation, decided to exclude trawling by fishing vessels over 18 metres length overall from inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020. </p><p>Based on my assessment, I consider that there is a compelling case for excluding trawling by large vessels in coastal waters inside six nautical miles.

I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for these fishermen and I firmly believe that this will, in the medium term, provide ecosystem and nursery stock benefits for all fishermen.</p><p>I am also mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and sea angling sectors, which the Government has committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>I also announced that there will be a transition period to 2022 for vessels over 18 metres targeting sprat.  This transition is in order to allow a period of adjustment for these vessels, as this fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.  I have asked BIM to offer affected vessel owners technical assistance to adjust to other fisheries during the transition period.</p><p>Vessels over 18 metres length overall will continue to be permitted inside 6 nautical miles to trawl for sprat only until 2022.  A total allowable catch of up to 2,000 tonnes, reflecting a reduction on recent years, will be permitted for these vessels during 2020, reducing to 1,000 tonnes in 2021.  All trawling activity by vessels over 18 metres length overall for sprat, inside the 6 mile limit, will end from the beginning of 2022.</p><p>Article 2 of Reg (EU) 1130/2017 sets out the Characteristics of Fishing vessels.  Regarding Length, it states the following:-</p><p><i>&quot;Length</i></p><p><i>1. The length of a vessel shall be the length overall, defined as the distance in a straight line between the foremost point of the bow and the aftermost point of the stern.</i></p><p><i>For the purposes of this definition:</i></p><p><i>(a) the bow shall be taken to include the watertight hull structure, forecastle, stem and forward bulwark, if fitted, but shall exclude bowsprits and safety rails;</i></p><p><i>(b) the stern shall be taken to include the watertight hull structure, transom, poop, trawl ramp and bulwark, but shall exclude safety rails, bumkins, propulsion machinery, rudders and steering gear, and divers' ladders and platforms.</i></p><p><i>The length overall shall be measured in metres with an accuracy of two decimals.&quot;</i></p><p>Length overall is the recognised measurement for vessels for Licensing and Registration purposes and the standard measurement for the majority of fisheries (with the exception for historical reasons of polyvalent Horse Mackerel, Celtic Sea Main Herring and North West Herring fisheries only).</p></reply>

This analysis found that the estimated cost of potential tariffs for the sector as a whole is &euro;1.7 billion, based on Irish agri-food exports to the United Kingdom of &euro;4.8 billion in 2016.  The decision as to how and when the UK might impose tariffs on imports from the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit is a sovereign matter for the UK Government.   </p>  <p>  I have been working very hard for some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts.  The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, I had a bilateral meeting with Commissioners Hogan and Vella to discuss the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors.  We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat and the challenges that it could present.  I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through:</p>  <p>  - traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation</p>  <p>  - increased flexibility under State Aid regulations</p>  <p>  - a common approach to managing fisheries and additional funding under the EMFF.</p>  <p>  My officials are in ongoing contact with the Commission and other Member States on these issues as the situation evolves. </p></reply>

The conclusions of the report state that there will be a supply deficit in sawlogs in 2020 but that this will be rectified by 2025.  The supply of material for the panel board manufacturing sector will be met from indigenous supply.  However, there will be a significant deficit in the supply of wood products for the wood energy sector by 2025. Measures to address this issue are already in place, with the Forest Roads scheme to mobilise greater volumes of timber and the Forestry for Fibre scheme, to meet the needs of the energy sector. However, barriers to these schemes have to be addressed and our objective is to ensure a balanced approach to the development of the island&rsquo;s wood resource to best meet the needs of both the wood processing and energy sectors.</p><p>&ldquo;Forests, products and people, Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy &ndash; a renewed vision&rdquo; was published in July 2014 following a comprehensive review of forestry policy in Ireland. This document listed strategic actions and priorities for the future development of the forestry Sector in Ireland and the objectives contained in the review strongly influenced the design and content of the Forestry Programme 2014-2020. This is an ambitious action plan for forestry covering 11 different measures and has a budget allocation of &euro;482m for the duration of the programme.  All 11 measures have been implemented. </p><p>Following the completion of the mid-term review of the Forestry Programme in February 2018, premiums and grants for the planting of native broadleaves and in particular for the Forestry for Fibre scheme to supply timber for the energy sector were increased. My Department also introduced, among other things, additional funding for building forest roads to encourage greater mobilisation of timber and  a National Forestry Knowledge Transfer Scheme for private forestry owners to develop forestry management skills. </p><p>Other measures to promote the mobilisation of timber are also in place as follows:</p><p>- the new <i>All Ireland Roundwood Production Forecast 2016-2035 </i>and the associated GIS Portal,</p><p>- enhanced efficiencies in dealing with felling licence applications,</p><p>- roundwood price information being provided to the public domain,</p><p>- an excellent programme of advice on woodland management and wood sales from Teagasc  aimed at all private growers.</p><p>The total expenditure for developing and promoting the forestry sector since 2014 is contained in the following table. The current programme was introduced in January 2015:<table><tr><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;109.6m</td><td>&euro;104m</td><td>&euro;103.8.</td><td>&euro;101.5m</td><td>&euro;94.55m</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department funded a pilot Forestry Certification project to address the barriers to forest certification for private forest owners, which include the cost and complexity of achieving this accreditation. This project funded the establishment of two certification groups and the development of a template to assist foresters in helping their clients achieve certification.  The key contributors to the project were the two participating forestry groups, the North East Forestry Group and the Forest Owners Co-operative Society. The pilot project was completed successfully in 2018. The next challenge in forest certification is  for the number of private owners to grow and this is matter for all stakeholders including representative groups, producers and the processing sector. Certification is primarily a market requirement and it is therefore a matter for those engaged with the market to design and implement the solutions which best meet their needs.  It should be noted that the entire Coillte estate of 439,000 hectares is certified by the FSC and PEFC certification bodies.</p><p>The level of aid available to private forest owners under the current Forestry Programme, both establishment grants and 15 year premiums, is shown by Grant and Premium Category (GPC) in the following table:<table><tr><th>GPC</th><th>Total Grant   Available&euro;/ha</th><th>Annual Premium  Rate&amp;lt;10ha</th><th>Annual Premium Rate&amp;gt;10ha</th></tr><tr><td>GPC 1 &ndash; Unenclosed</td><td>&euro;2,740</td><td>&euro;185</td><td>&euro;190</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 2 - Sitka spruce/Lodgepole pine</td><td>&euro;3,705</td><td>&euro;440</td><td>&euro;450</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 3 &ndash; 10% Diverse Conifer e.g. Sitka spruce and 10% broadleaves</td><td>&euro;3,815</td><td>&euro;510</td><td>&euro;520</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 4 &ndash; Diverse Conifer e.g., Scots pine, Douglas Fir</td><td>&euro;4,310</td><td>&euro;590</td><td>&euro;600</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 5 &ndash; Broadleaf e.g. sycamore</td><td>&euro;5,880</td><td>&euro;605</td><td>&euro;620</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 6 &ndash; Oak</td><td>&euro;6,220</td><td>&euro;645</td><td>&euro;660</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 7 &ndash; Beech</td><td>&euro;6,220</td><td>&euro;645</td><td>&euro;660</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 8 &ndash; Alder and Birch</td><td>&euro;4,195</td><td>&euro;605</td><td>&euro;620</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 9- Native Woodland Establishment (oak-birch-holly-hazel)</td><td>&euro;6,220</td><td>&euro;665</td><td>&euro;680</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 10- Native Woodland Establishment (alder-oak woodland)</td><td>&euro;5,880</td><td>&euro;665</td><td>&euro;680</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 11 - Agro-forestry  </td><td>&euro;6,220</td><td>&euro;645</td><td>&euro;660</td></tr><tr><td>GPC 12 &ndash; Forestry-for-Fibre </td><td>&euro;3,815</td><td>&euro;510</td><td>&euro;520</td></tr></table></p><p>Considerable progress has already been made in tackling the challenge of timber mobilisation since the introduction of the current programme and my Department will continue to engage with all stakeholders to ensure a greater supply of timber to meet industry demands.</p></reply>

Gas connections to any new area is evaluated in accordance with the criteria in GNI&rsquo;s Connections Policy, as approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), the statutorily independent energy regulator, which conducts consultations on its regulatory decisions. The cost-benefit for the connection needs to be positive i.e. the expected revenues over a period of time must exceed the projected costs for the project to be viable. The Connections Policy appraises both domestic and industrial/commercial demand, and so proximity to a major pipeline and a large industrial/commercial gas load tend to be the most significant factors in town appraisals.</p>  <p>  I am informed that GNI received only one previous connection enquiry from a resident of this estate in 2015 and that the connection did not subsequently proceed further.

As outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) report &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s Transboundary Gas Emissions 1990 - 2016&quot;, published in March of last year, Ireland exceeded the NOx limits set out in Directive 2001/81<i>/</i>EC for all years from 2010 to 2016. The Directive allows, however, an adjustment to emissions to reflect ongoing improvements to estimation methodologies updated in accordance with scientific knowledge. Ireland, with the approval of the European Commission, has applied this adjustment and so is considered to be in legal compliance for all years since 2011.</p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) standards relate to ambient air quality, rather than to overall emissions. The EPA's annual Air Quality in Ireland Report for 2017 (the latest year for which figures are available) indicates that NO2 was monitored at 14 sites in 2017. The NO2 concentrations at all monitoring sites were below the European Union (EU) annual limit value and WHO annual air quality guideline value. There were also no exceedances of the EU NO2 hourly limit value. There was one hourly average above the hourly WHO air quality guideline in 2017 (at the monitoring station in Blanchardstown, Dublin).</p><p>Notwithstanding compliance with EU standards, I am concerned at recent scientific evidence which indicates that air pollution is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood. With that in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first national Clean Air Strategy. The Strategy, which I intend to publish this year, will include a range of specific actions to reduce the health impacts of air pollution, as well as providing the policy framework necessary to identify and promote further integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air and better health, while delivering on wider national objectives including supporting the transition to a low carbon society.</p></reply>

These Directives include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality. For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Ireland established a nationwide network of monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at <i>www.airquality.ie</i>The criteria for the location of monitoring equipment for each pollutant are set out in the Directives.</p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. The AAMP will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. </p><p>Of the 39 additional stations planned as part of the AAMP, 12 were completed by the end of 2018, including 2 stations in Dublin in Saint Anne&rsquo;s Park and Saint John&rsquo;s Road. In addition to this, existing stations as outlined below were upgraded to provide real-time PM10 and PM2.5 information. </p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Ballyfermot</p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Davitt Road</p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Finglas</p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Marino</p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Phoenix Park</p><p>- Dublin &ndash; Ringsend</p><p>- Cork &ndash; Heatherton Park</p><p>- Castlebar</p><p>- Kilkenny</p><p>Further additional stations and station upgrades are planned for 2019 and 2020, a number of which will be in the greater Dublin area, including a new monitoring station on Pearse Street.

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding. This means focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the measures available under the scheme were expanded. Subject to a survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This is permitting the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increasing the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme is achieving and will also enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting this shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel. </p>  <p>  The measures offered under the scheme are currently being reviewed again in light of new Building Regulations coming into force later this year. Any works carried out under the scheme will need to comply with the requirements set out under those regulations, while also taking account of the budget available to the scheme.</p>  <p>  While homes that previously received works under the scheme are not currently eligible for a second visit, consideration will be given to revisiting these properties later in 2019, where feasible and appropriate.</p></reply>

Consideration was given to amending secondary legislation around the level of permit fees payable by a waste operator, which are currently &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;5,000 depending on whether the application to collect waste is in a single local authority functional area, a region or nationally. However, advice was received that fees collected from waste operators to support activities, such as enforcement, may constitute a levy and was not proceeded with. In that context, the issue of a contribution to enforcement from the sector will be revisited in the context of the review of "A Resource Opportunity" taking place in 2019.</p>  <p>  Issues concerning the enforcement of waste legislation are statutory matters for local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency as appropriate, who both have significant powers under waste legislation to secure compliance from waste operators. The role of my Department is to provide a comprehensive legislative and policy framework through which the enforcement authorities operate. </p>  <p>  Waste enforcement activities on the ground have received significant support through the continued annual investment of &euro;7.4 million in the network of 150 local authority waste enforcement officers and the further development of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authority (WERLA) Offices with an annual budget in excess of &euro;1 million. I regard the introduction of the WERLA model in 2015 as one of the most significant reforms introduced in the local authority sector in a decade. Through this structure and with the cooperation of local authority waste enforcement personnel, a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to tackling waste crime in Ireland is being achieved. This investment is critical in providing an enhanced response on the ground to infractions of the waste code and enables enforcement personnel to carry out a verifiable programme of waste enforcement activity and deal with national waste enforcement priorities while sending a strong signal to waste operators that a robust enforcement presence continues to be maintained. </p>  <p>  My Department has also developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since 2017, funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available from the Environment Fund in this regard which has supported over 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating black spots and equipping local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws. A review of this initiative is underway, which will inform a 2019 anti-dumping work programme that will place an increased emphasis on all actors who facilitate the unauthorised movement and disposal of waste.</p></reply>

This reflects Ireland's position as one of the leading countries in the EU for packaging recycling and recovery. The latest statistics for packaging recycling for 2016, published by the EPA, show that Ireland has met and exceeded all EU targets for packaging recycling and recovery. In relation to plastic packaging specifically, Ireland has exceeded its recycling target by 60% - Ireland recycled 36% of its plastic packaging waste in 2016 against an EU target of 22.5%. The overall packaging recycling and recovery rate in Ireland has grown from a very low base to 88% in 2016.</p>  <p>  When a new directive is proposed by the European Commission, the Irish authorities consider the proposals in terms of our national policy and objectives and any implications that may arise from the proposals. It would not be unusual practice for national authorities, from time to time, to seek or receive the views of experts and stakeholders when considering a national response to a specific draft proposal, although this process would not typically be set out in a formal document. This process enables the development of an informed national position by Ireland, particularly where there are technical discussions of this nature. I believe this is a common practice among all Member States and particularly in technical or complex discussions of this type.</p></reply>

I am working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors. </p>  <p>  The All of Government Plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with specific timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. It will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The EU has in place an ambitious set of greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets for the period to 2030 which are one of the most ambitious of any party to the Paris Agreement. These targets are supported by an underpinning policy framework at EU level in the key sectors of energy, buildings and transport, through the Climate and Energy legislative package. It is important that EU Member States now put in place the necessary domestic policy framework to enable them to deliver on their respective non-ETS targets which have only recently been finalised at EU level. </p>  <p>  It is important that the EU is able to review its targets on a regular basis in the context of measuring progress towards their achievement. This is also important given the expectation that all parties to the Paris Agreement review and strengthen their commitments over time in order to meet the objectives of the Agreement.</p></reply>

By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.  </p>  <p>  Some 186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January.  </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it may well be the third quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.</p></reply>

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena Line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. </p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. </p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department. </p>  <p>  As such, there is currently no plan to publish the report to which the Deputy's question refers although a redacted version of the report was released under Freedom of Information in 2017.</p>  <p>  I am however satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port's business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the Port over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports, including Rosslare, and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year, most recently last month, about the infrastructural requirements of the port in connection with Brexit.  My Department has also been meeting ferry and shipping companies regarding their plans for dealing with the challenges of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I do not accept that the ownership structure is impeding the development of Rosslare Europort and, as outlined above, a significant investment plan and preparations for Brexit are underway. Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate to have a debate in the D&aacute;il on this matter at the current time. </p></reply>

Its purpose is to advise and inform me as Minister on all matters of aviation security and to coordinate the implementation of the National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP), which is a work programme agreed on an annual basis with the objective of improving aviation security and ensuring international standards are met. The Committee meets on a six-monthly basis. It has met eleven times over the last five years. The Deputy will understand that due to the security sensitive nature of the deliberations of the NCASC, discussions and decisions are confidential. </p>  <p>  Aviation security is a highly regulated area in accordance with international agreements. It is subject to requirements arising from Ireland's membership of  the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and European Regulations. The State is committed to implementing best international practice.</p>  <p>  European Regulations on aviation security are reflected in the NCASP, as required by Article 10 of EC Regulation 300/2008 and S.I. 226 of 2003, as amended.  Of particular relevance, Article 1.3.2 of the Annex to EC Regulation 300/2008 states that "All persons other than passengers, together with items carried, shall be screened upon entering critical parts of security restricted areas in order to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into these parts." While there is an option in this Regulation for objective reasons to exempt certain persons other than passengers, new, enhanced security arrangements were introduced at airports on 30 January 2019. This decision was based on a security risk assessment carried out by the IAA in accordance with the Security Programme (NCASP) and agreed by the Security Committee (NCASC).</p>  <p>  As is standard procedure, the new security arrangements are subject to periodic review to ensure that they are being implemented as required and that they remain an effective component of the overall aviation security response by the State.</p></reply>

My Department is represented on all relevant cross-Departmental coordination structures, and an internal Departmental Committee on Brexit meets regularly to oversee the Department's analyses and planning in the areas of aviation, land transport, maritime transport and tourism.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaged in extensive contingency planning in relation to Brexit, including for a possible no-deal scenario.  I, and officials from my Department, have continually stressed the importance that all stakeholders, including the regional airports, take all necessary steps within their control to prepare for Brexit, including the importance of undertaking contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations.  Ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including with regional airports, on Brexit continues to be a central part of Government's preparations for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In terms of connectivity, the European Commission published a draft proposal last December for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules ensuring basic connectivity with regard to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the Union.  Subject to reciprocity from the UK, it is anticipated that the vast majority of flights to/from Ireland to the UK, including from the regional airports, would still be able to operate post-Brexit.</p>  <p>  However, under all possible scenarios, the UK's withdrawal from the EU will bring change to the Aviation sector and while much is being done by Government, it is also very much up to the all those doing business in Ireland, including the regional airports themselves to prepare for a 'no-deal' scenario, and to engage in their own specific contingency planning.</p></reply>

I will keep industry representative bodies informed and the information on the Department&rsquo;s website will continue to be updated as further developments arise.  In the context of the haulage sector it is vital to minimise the impact of Brexit by avoiding any new undue regulatory burden for our hauliers.  I can assure you that I and other Government Ministers continue to engage with our EU counterparts, our colleagues across Government and the European Commission to protect the interests of our haulage sector and more particularly our connectivity. In December 2018 the European Commission made a proposal for a regulation relating to road freight transport to ensure basic road freight connectivity with regard to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  My Department&rsquo;s officials are working with the EU Commission and our EU counterparts to advance this legislative proposal. </p>  <p>   All Government Departments and agencies are continuing their contingency planning for Brexit, both for an orderly and a disorderly scenario.

However, the default position is that Green Cards are required for vehicles entering the EU from Third Countries, unless the EU Commission declares otherwise.</p>  <p>  If the UK were to exit the EU without a deal, the default position would be that Green Cards would be required for EU-registered vehicles entering the UK and for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU.  While the Government remains of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU - including avoiding the necessity for Green Cards - is the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement reached between the EU and the UK, the Government recognises that it is prudent to plan for the possibility of a 'no deal' exit.  </p>  <p>  The motor insurance industry is therefore behaving prudently in being prepared for the possibility that Green Cards will be required, even though this is not a desirable outcome.   In line with the current expected Brexit date of 29th March 2019, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has indicated that insurers and insurance brokers will begin issuing Green Cards to policyholders from March if no agreement has been reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit or the process has not been further delayed.  At that point anyone who plans on driving their Irish registered vehicle in Northern Ireland or Britain should contact their insurer or insurance broker one month in advance of their expected travel date to ensure they receive their Green Card in sufficient time. </p>  <p>  As part of its contingency planning, the Government has raised this matter directly with the European Commission seeking agreement from it to set a date from which green cards would not be required.  The Commission has not made a decision to date and the Government continues to pursue the matter with it.</p></reply>

All childcare services in receipt of Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs must sign a CCS grant funding agreement which covers a one year period, Under the terms of this agreement the service must be familiar with the rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes and must cooperate fully with the DCYA in this regard.    </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department inform the service named at the beginning of each programme year that funding is subject to an annual evaluation and funding approved for previous years is not a guarantee of any future amounts.  </p>  <p>  Following the evaluation a service can also be requested to submit further documentation/clarifications.  Communications for the initial part of a review for the service named were concluded recently.  As part of the reviews being carried out for the programme year 2018-19 my Department has requested the assistance of the City/County Childcare Committees (CCC's).  Visits will be made by the Dublin City Childcare Committee to this service in the coming weeks with the a view to conclusion of the review by the end of April.  </p>  <p>  I fully appreciate the difficult and complex situation where service providers can find themselves waiting for a review to be finalised and in recognition of this a further tranche of funding will be allocated for the 2018/2019 programme year in March 2019 to the service named.  However, no further funding will be released until the review has been fully completed.</p>  <p>  I am aware that community childcare settings provide an invaluable service to children and families across the country and face a variety of challenges to their sustainability and my Department has made a number of supports available to community services in difficulty. Pobal who administer the schemes on behalf of my Department oversee an integrated Case Management system through which a dedicated team assesses services facing crisis situations and provide support including financial supports where necessary. This option was offered to the service named.</p>  <p>  There is a requirement for services to register children where possible and the service named indicated this may be  possible however no registrations have been made by the service to date. Officials from my Department will continue to work with the service to bring the evaluation to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I have requested some additional information and recommendations from Tusla. I hope to make an announcement with regard to the additional funding of &euro;1.5m for FRCs before the Easter break.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the further development of Family Resource Centres and I will continue to seek funding for them in future budget discussions.

It was first introduced in 2010 as a one-year programme to provide children with their first formal experience of early learning prior to commencing primary school. </p><p>In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, the ECCE Programme was extended in September 2018.  Children are now eligible to enrol in this Programme once they are two years and eight months of age in the September of a given programme year and are eligible to avail of two years of the programme (provided that they are not older than five years and six months at the end of the programme year year).  The proportion of children availing on this full entitlement is determined by a range of factors, including the child&rsquo;s month of birth, parental choice with regard to school starting age and average uptake rates since the Programme was introduced, for example 95% for the one year programme. </p><p>Based on data on school starting age from the Department of Education and Skills that rate to the 2013 birth cohort, it is estimated that 75% of children born in 2015 will avail of two full years of the ECCE programme.

This increased funding level was maintained in 2018 and 2019. </p>  <p>  The Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2018 included the provision of &euro;1.2 million to upgrade the eight Volunteer Information Services to full Volunteer Centres in order to provide a consistent level of volunteering service nationwide. My Department is currently engaging with stakeholders in the roll-out of this initiative. As part of this exercise, my Department is also examining options with regard to a number of existing Volunteer Centres which are currently receiving less funding than the minimum amount recommended in the McLaughlin report. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently collating information received from a recent call for input exercise that was designed as a first step towards developing a draft national volunteering strategy.  Among the topics under consideration in this context is the issue of volunteering support infrastructure and how best this can be structured to support volunteering.</p></reply>

They and their employers pay a higher rate of PRSI and they are eligible for all social welfare benefits.  It is not possible for modified rate contributors to opt to pay the full Class A contribution. </p>  <p>  In general, teachers retiring with only a PRSI Class D contribution paid receive a pension benefit from the Department of Education and Skills based on  pensionable service and this is called an uncoordinated pension.  </p>  <p>  Teachers retiring with only a PRSI Class A  paid receive a pension benefit from the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills based on their retirement salary up to a threshold of 3.33 times the single rate of the State contributory pension.  This is called a co-ordinated pension.  Teachers who pay Class A PRSI contributions do not receive separate State and occupational pensions based on those same contributions.</p>  <p>  It is also possible for a teacher to have at the time of their retirement a mixture of both PRSI classes of A and of D.  This is called a "split pension&ldquo;.</p>  <p>  The State pension (contributory) is a pension paid to people who reach state pension age (currently 66, rising to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028).  Since its introduction in 1961, entitlements have been based on a Yearly Average calculation, where the number of reckonable weekly PRSI contributions are divided by the number of years between entering social insurance and state pension age.  Provisions also exist for the award of a mixed insurance pro rata state pension, where a person has substantial periods of PRSI coverage that are not reckonable for pension purposes.  Whether or not such a pro-rata pension is more advantageous to a person with significant Class D contributions will depend upon their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to change the calculation method used for the State Pension (Contributory) by introducing a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing the level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards (TCA2020).</p>  <p>  I launched a public consultation on the design of the full TCA to be introduced from 2020 on the 28 May last year to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback.  All Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing in Leinster House by my officials shortly afterwards.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations including open written submissions.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on a number of issues, including the number of years required for a full pension, as intended as part of the consultation process.  An analysis of the views expressed in this consultation was recently submitted to me.  When I have considered this analysis, I will bring a proposal for the full design of a Total Contributions Approach to Government for its consideration.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

CE supervisors, as employees of these organisations, are an integral part of that good work.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to emphasise the fact that CE scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions, pension contributions or the Pension-related Deduction, PRD, under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account, PRSA, under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  </p>  <p>  The issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  Exchequer funded pension entitlements for CE supervisors presents very significant issues for the Exchequer.  These supervisors comprise just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector.  Nevertheless, on foot of the Labour Court recommendation, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347 million depending on the numbers involved, which is hard to establish. This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  CE supervisors may qualify for the State Pension (Contributory) if they have accrued sufficient PRSI contributions. The State Pension (Contributory) is not means-tested.  This pension has a maximum personal rate payable of &euro;12,695 per annum, increasing to &euro;12,956 in March 2019. </p></reply>

These payments are being reviewed under a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pension calculation which includes provision for homecaring periods.  My Department has already written to these pensioners to explain the process.</p>  <p>I have last week signed the necessary regulations, which together provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, allows the increased payments to be made on foot of the reviews.  The Department has already started issuing the outcome of reviews and the first increased payments will start to issue this week.  These increased payments will include arrears to 30 March 2018, or the pensioner's 66th birthday if later.  Where a person's pension rate does not increase as a result of this review, the person will continue to be paid at their existing rate of entitlement.  No one will be worse off as a result of this review.  </p>  <p>   Where possible, my Department will use information already held to assist in the reviews.  In some, but not all, cases additional information is required from pensioners about unexplained gaps in their social insurance record to complete their review.  Since January, almost 24,000 requests for additional information were issued.  The person concerned received a request for further information.   The information request letter includes details of how to provide the required information using my Department&rsquo;s online services.  This is the easiest way to provide the requested information.  The letter includes a dedicated telephone number for those who may need help or support to make their application.  Those who do not have access to a personal computer, or the internet, can also call the telephone number provided on the letter to request a paper application.  Paper applications have  started to issue this week to those who have requested them.  </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that regardless of when a person&rsquo;s review is processed, if they are due an increase their weekly rate will be adjusted without delay and arrears paid, backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person's 66th birthday if later.  Given the numbers involved, it will take my Department a number of months to complete the reviews.  Around 120 additional temporary staff have been recruited to help with this work.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This payment reflects a range of factors negotiated over the years including fare increases, peak time access to free travel, service improvements, changes and enhancements.

These surveys provide valuable insights into how customers interact with the Department&rsquo;s processes and services and may also act as a benchmark against which future progress may be measured. </p><p>With regard to the survey on the Public Services Card (PSC), a stratified random sample of everyone who had been issued a PSC in September 2018 was undertaken.  This sampling method ensures that the resulting sample reflects key population distributions which, in this case, was everyone aged over 18 who received a PSC in September 2018.  The population was stratified by sex and age band (18-24, 25-39, 40-59, 60+), and then randomly sampled.  In total, 5,000 people were in the random sample and 1,001 people took part in the survey.</p><p>A letter was sent to everyone selected to take part in the survey inviting them to take part in the survey.  The letter outlined that participation was entirely voluntary, and that their answers, participation, or refusal to participate, cannot and will not affect any services or payments the customer might avail of.  Amongst other things, the contact letter also outlined how and why they were selected to take part, details of the company commissioned to conduct the survey and channels for customer queries regarding the survey.</p><p>The survey was undertaken independently on behalf of the Department by W5, specialists in customer experience consultancy and was done through telephone interview in December 2018.  The questions measured satisfaction with the processes and procedures involved in applying for a PSC and of undergoing SAFE authentication.  The overall cost of undertaking the survey is &euro;22,900 ex-VAT.</p><p>Overall, the results of the survey are very positive and show high levels of satisfaction reported by PSC holders.  The Department intends to publish the Survey Report shortly.

Written notice must be served on the contractor 6 months in advance of a termination.  The amount of compensation to be paid to the service providers is stipulated in the contract, however the amount of compensation, having been separately negotiated with each contractor, is commercially sensitive.  To publish same would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.  In addition to the financial liability, termination of the contract would have a significant impact on the 600 employees of the contractors, their sub-contractors and suppliers. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware the referral phase of the JobPath contract, which commenced in 2015, is due to come to an end this year.

In recent years, as the economy has been recovering, the Government has concentrated resources in improving the core rates of payments, particularly for pensioners, resulting in considerable increases in these rates. </p>  <p>  The Bereavement Grant was a payment of &euro;850 made where the deceased or his/her surviving partner was an insured contributor to the social insurance fund.  Any decision to reinstate it would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Allowance scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  This is a more targeted and efficient manner of assisting people with bereavement expenses. In 2018 ENPs were made in respect of 2,812 funerals at a cost of &euro;5.317 million and 69 burial expenses at a cost of &euro;140,674. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.</p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  </p><p>If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.</p><p>I trust this

The Report examines a number of issues in relation to inequality, including inequality in wealth, education, health and employment.  In response to the Deputy's specific question regarding high incidence of low pay and weak labour protection, I would point out that the Government continues to work to protect vulnerable employees.  Ireland has a robust suite of employment legislation to ensure this is the case. </p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,614 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;1,999 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  It ranks in sixth place when allowing for purchasing power standards.  However, it is important to note that these figures do not take into account the recent increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019.  While the percentage of earners on the national minimum wage in Ireland is higher than some other EU Member States, this is due, at least in part, to the presence of a large number of Multi-National Corporations which, typically, drive up the median wage rate.</p>  <p>  The results of the ESRI research study &ldquo;The Impact of a Change in the National Minimum Wage on the Distribution of Hourly Wages in Ireland&rdquo;, published in July 2018 indicate that without the minimum wage change, approximately 10 percent of workers in 2016 would have earned on or below &euro;9.15 per hour.  However, following the increase in the minimum wage, just 6 percent of workers had an hourly wage in this range.  Therefore, the minimum wage change resulted in a four percentage point reduction in the number of workers earning on or below &euro;9.15 per hour.</p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.  More generally, this area comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).</p>  <p>  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and the interaction of individual earnings with household income. State-provided supports such as Child Benefit, Working Family Payment (WFP) as well as supports available in relation to housing, education and health, all contribute to an individual&rsquo;s standard of living. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the WFP is an in-work support, which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  There are currently over 54,000 families with more than 122,000 children in receipt of WFP.  The estimated spend on WFP in 2018 is in the region of &euro;431 million.  The Department also provides an extensive system of social welfare support which facilitates recipients taking up some employment while permitting them to maintain their social welfare payment. These include the Back to Work Family Dividend, Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Transitional Payment, and the One-parent Family Payment.  </p>  <p>  The evolution of the main elements of labour law in Ireland relating to employment rights, employment protection and non-discrimination, reflects a strong focus on the enactment of legislation based on clearly identified needs at the national level and arising from wider European Union developments.  In the formulation and development of labour law there has been a clear policy focus aimed at finding the appropriate balance between the security which employees require on the one hand, in terms of conditions of employment etc., and the flexibility required by employers on the other, in terms of organisation of work, work practices etc. </p>  <p>  Employment rights legislation was recently strengthened by the addition of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which is one of the most significant pieces of employment legislation in a generation.  The Act delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to address the challenges of increased casualisation of work and to strengthen the regulation of precarious employment. The key objective of the Act, which comes into effect on 4 March, is to improve the security and predictability of hours for those working in less secure employment arrangements and those working variable hours. </p>  <p>  Under the Workplace Relations Act 2015, the State's workplace relations structures were streamlined, resulting in a new two-tier system involving the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the Labour Court.  This greatly improved the complaint adjudication and appeal process for both employees and employers alike, in addition to the excellent service provided by the WRC conciliation, mediation and Inspectorate functions. </p>  <p>  The WRC is mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of their employment rights, they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication, leading to a decision enforceable through the District Court.  WRC Inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches of the legislation.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU. These figures do not take into account the recent increase in the minimum wage to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019.</p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers. </p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.

Under the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015, local authorities are obliged to levy rates on any property, used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation.  </p>  <p>  There is legislative provision for the refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances. While the Local Government Act 1946 provides that rates generally apply to vacant properties there is provision for a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes. The specified purposes include additions, alterations or repairs to the property or where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The operation of the refund provisions is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Under the 1946 Act, the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas. However, under separate legislation governing refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, only 50% of the rates paid were refundable. With effect from 1 June 2014, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gave discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. </p>  <p>  The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided, in respect of the relevant local electoral area, shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds, as set out above, apply.  Further, guidance in this area has been provided to local authorities.</p>  <p>  The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is currently before the Oireachtas and completed Second Stage recently. Section 8 of the Bill provides that a local authority may provide a temporary abatement for vacant properties, subject to any maximum relief which may be specified by the Minister. The Bill is a key priority of my Department and, when enacted, will facilitate more effective and streamlined rates collection procedures.</p></reply>

A local authority may, as a reserved function and following at least 65% support at a tenant plebiscite, designate for tenant purchase an apartment complex comprising at least 5 apartments, which does not contain apartments designed for elderly persons or retail units and which meets statutory criteria.</p>  <p>  Under Section 50 of the 2009 Act, &ldquo;apartment complex&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;land on which there stands erected a building or buildings, comprising or together comprising not less than 5 apartments (but not including any community apartment) and the common areas, structures, works and services&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The local authority must consult the tenants in relation to a proposal to designate an apartment complex and must hold a plebiscite on the proposal. If at least 65% of the tenants vote in favour of the proposal, then the elected members of the local authority may designate the complex for tenant purchase. However, under Section 54 of the 2009 Act, where an apartment has been sold by the local authority under section 90 of the Housing Act 1966, whether before or after the coming into operation of this scheme, the apartment shall not be included for the purposes of the tenant plebiscite.</p>  <p>  Prior to sale, the authority will transfer ownership of the complex to an apartment owners&rsquo; management company established under the Companies Acts, in which the authority is, in most cases, the sole member. The apartments would then be sold to tenant applicants at discounts of 40% - 60%, depending on their level of income. An incremental purchase charge is placed on the property by the authority that withers away over a period related to the level of discount received, subject to compliance with the conditions of the sale, notably that a member of the purchaser&rsquo;s household must live in the apartment for the duration of the charged period and that the purchaser pays the management company annual charges in respect of the apartment. </p>  <p>  The membership of the management company associated with the apartment transfers from the authority to the tenant purchaser. The authority will continue to let apartments in the complex in the normal way to tenants who do not wish to purchase and participate in the affairs of the management company as owners of those apartments. </p>  <p>  The tenant purchaser of an apartment has all the normal responsibilities of a dwelling owner, including decorating, maintaining and repairing the apartment, and insuring its contents, at his or her own expense.  In addition, by virtue of his or her membership of the management company, the apartment owner is part-owner of the common areas, etc., with an obligation to play a part in managing and maintaining them, including the payment of the management company annual charges levied on the apartment, attending and participating in meetings of the company, and serving as a director of the company from time to time.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Acts apply to dwellings let by approved housing bodies (AHBs) to social housing tenants since 7 April 2016, making the RTB dispute resolution service available to the sector and providing tenancy protections.  </p>  <p>   The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2018, which was published on 19 December 2018, contains amendments to enhance the rental data to be provided to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), including provision for the annual registration of tenancies. The aim is to gather more accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis to improve the information available to assist with policy formulation in the residential rental sector. Sections 15 and 16 of the Bill amend sections 137 and 137A of the Residential Tenancies  Act,  respectively, and provide for the RTB to charge fees, without exemptions, for annual registrations of tenancies - including a &euro;40 fee per tenancy registration by private providers and &euro;20 per tenancy registration by an AHB.  Under the new annual registration requirements, a fee can only be charged in respect of the same dwelling once per year and a discounted single registration fee (&euro;170 for a private landlord, &euro;85 for an AHB landlord) can be applied where the same landlord registers not more than 10 tenancies of dwellings comprised in the same property. </p>  <p>   The key change from the existing registration fees is that AHBs will be charged fees that are half those applicable to private providers &ndash; currently, all landlords pay the same registration fee. The reduction in AHB fees is proposed in recognition of the public service that they provide in meeting the housing needs of those in receipt of social housing supports, and of AHBs'  charitable (or similar) status.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway.

It is the first comprehensive upgrade of Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure in over 60 years. </p><p>An additional 330 million litres of treated water a day is estimated to be needed in the Greater Dublin and Eastern and Midlands Region by 2050. In 2015, Irish Water embarked on an extensive public consultation process to identify a new source of water supply for the region. Overall, ten options were assessed on technical environmental and economic grounds. The abstraction of raw water from the Parteen Basin and the Lower River Shannon was ultimately identified as the preferred option.</p><p>The Water Services Act 2013 requires the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide consent for all commitments for capital expenditure above a certain threshold.  Given the scale and importance of the Eastern and Midlands Water Supply Project, and recognising the statutory role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as independent economic regulator of Irish Water, including its role of reviewing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans, I have requested the CRU to undertake the review to support my decision as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in relation to the capital consent that will be required in the event that planning approval is obtained for the project. The request to the CRU is consistent with the CRU&rsquo;s role under Section 40 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to advise the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the development and delivery of water services.  The review is currently ongoing.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are available on the CRU website at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works is responsible for the conservation and maintenance of these monuments on a day-to-day basis in co-operation and consultation with my Department. </p><p>As in previous years, alongside its Office of Public Works and local authority partners, my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service will make available such funding as may be required over the course of 2019 in relation to the discharge of my functions under the National Monuments Acts to support rescue excavations and post excavation research at archaeological sites where there is an urgent risk to such being irreparably lost or damaged.</p><p>My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through grant schemes which are generally administered by the local authorities. In November 2018, I announced a total of &euro;4.3 million in funding for the <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme</i>and <i>Historic Structures Fund</i>for 2019.</p><p>The <i>Built Heritage Investment Scheme </i>is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals, trades persons and craftsmen and women.  The <i>Historic Structures Fund</i>is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public.</p><p>Both schemes were open for applications to local authorities until 31 January 2019; full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on each local authority website.  While it would be premature to provide information on applications received at this point,  I will be announcing the successful projects under these schemes in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website . Among the initiatives supported by the Heritage Council is The Irish Walled Towns Network, of which Drogheda is a member. I understand that some of the structures referred to by the Deputy have been in receipt of Heritage Council assistance, including financial, in the past. </p></reply>
