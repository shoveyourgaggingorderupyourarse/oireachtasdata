The Plan includes a suite of measures to support our rural towns and villages, with a view to revitalising over 600 towns and villages over its lifetime.  </p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme is a key part of the Action Plan for Rural Development. Since the launch of the Action Plan, I have allocated &euro;21.6 million to 281 projects throughout the country under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. This follows on from &euro;10 million which was allocated to 170 projects under the scheme in 2016, prior to the publication of the Action Plan. The Town and Village Renewal Scheme has therefore provided in excess of &euro;31 million to over 450 projects since 2016.</p>  <p>I launched the 2018 Town and Village Renewal Scheme on 27 April last, which will see up to 200 further towns and villages benefit from an indicative allocation of &euro;15 million over the next 15 to 18 months.  </p>  <p>  A further call for proposals in 2019 would see the target of supporting the revitalisation of 600 towns and villages over the period 2017 to 2019 being reached, or even exceeded.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide an opportunity to deliver more integrated and ambitious projects which will further support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages in the coming years. The first call for proposals under this Fund is now open and applications will be accepted up to 12 noon on 27th September.</p></reply>

The scheme involves landholders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walks that traverse their lands. Participant landholders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 landholders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development both include a commitment to increase the number of trails covered by the Walks Scheme. </p>  <p>  My officials are working towards this objective and will review the scheme&rsquo;s operation over the coming months to determine how best to expand the scheme and to maximise the impact of the resources available to me.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, I hope to be in a position to announce areas where the scheme will initially be expanded.</p></reply>

More than &euro;46 million is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2018.  </p>  <p>  The CSP contribution to the cost of employees is not aligned to the national minimum wage. It is a fixed annual contribution of &euro;19,033 per full-time equivalent and &euro;32,000 per manager and is is required to be co-funded by the organisation concerned from other sources, for example, from income received from the use of their facilities and services.  In order to pay staff the current minimum wage, a top up of &euro;2,000 per full-time equivalent is required from organisations. In 2010, as the minimum wage was lower than it is currently, no top-up was required.  </p>  <p>  My Department will be commencing a review of the CSP shortly. Decisions on the structure of funding supports for CSP funded organisations will be considered in the context of this review.</p></reply>

SICAP supports disadvantaged communities and individuals including unemployed people, people living in deprived areas, people with disabilities, single parent families, people on a low income, members of the Traveller and Roma community and other disadvantaged groups.</p>  <p>  I announced the second SICAP programme, covering 2018 to 2022, earlier this year.  It has a funding allocation nationally of &euro;38 million in 2018 and will provide some &euro;190 million over the five year period of the Programme to support the most disadvantaged individuals and communities in our society. This amount also includes an allocation under the European Social Fund (ESF). </p>  <p>  SICAP's goals relate to supporting both groups and also individuals on a one to one basis. It provides capacity at local level to respond to the particular needs in each area.  It is managed locally by 33 Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) with support from Local Authorities and is administered on my Department's behalf by Pobal.  In its mid-year review of 2018, Pobal has reported to my Department that the Programme is well on course to meet its targets, with over 27,000 individuals supported by mid year.  In addition, there were over 5,000 interventions for Local Community Groups in the same period.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-25a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092500059#WRB02100"><p>The primary objective behind the pilot scheme is to encourage people to return to living in town centres as part of the effort to revitalise rural towns and villages.  A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, was established to examine the issue.  A lot of consideration has been given by the Steering Group to the best approach to developing a model which will deliver on the stated objective. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to rejuvenating towns and villages in rural Ireland.  The factors which attract people to live in particular settlements can be many and varied, including the availability of schools, shops, transport and other services.  Apart from the need to identify suitable properties which may be available for residential purposes, it is important that the right infrastructure and services are in place to make the town attractive and safe for people and families to live in.  This requires supports that renovation grants alone cannot deliver.  </p>  <p>  The Steering Group noted that some schemes such as the Home Renovation Incentive Scheme are already available to home owners for refurbishment and improvements, while other schemes which have specifically attempted to focus on the renovation of vacant properties have had a disappointing take-up. </p>  <p>  It is clear that if we are to successfully encourage people to return to living in town centres, an integrated solution involving all aspects of town living and supporting infrastructure, needs to be considered.   </p>  <p>  The Steering Group has agreed that a pilot scheme, which takes a holistic approach to town centre living, be piloted in a small number of towns initially, with a view to a wider roll-out over time if the pilot is successful.  This approach, which I have approved, will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a small number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations.  The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p></reply>

Its mission is to provide growth capital to Ireland&rsquo;s best social innovations, investing in solutions to social problems and creating jobs.  SIFI finds and backs innovative solutions to critical social issues in Ireland and is charged with establishing a philanthropic fund of significant size and impact to aid the development of social innovation. </p>  <p>  In partnership with others, SIFI supports innovations that enable healthy, resilient communities, and tackle issues like educational disadvantage and exclusion. SIFI backs social innovators to sustain them, scale them and maximise their impact. </p>  <p>  The Department has recently agreed a three-year contract with SIFI which will include a continued commitment to match philanthropic funding raised by SIFI with State funding. This funding model will allow SIFI to continue its work in providing growth capital and support to Ireland&rsquo;s best social innovations. Every euro raised in philanthropy by SIFI is matched by my Department from funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, SIFI has opened 15 public calls for applications, and supported 47 innovations to date which have an impact in every county in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The selection process consists of a number of stages which are carried out by SIFI as an independent organization in line with its governance requirements.  In the first instance, an internal review is undertaken to ensure all criteria have been met.

Building on this exercise, a call was issued to all Local Authorities in 2018 to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to improve telecommunications services. </p>  <p>  To date, 17 Local Authorities have provided data on more than 200 blackspots, although it should be borne in mind that the number of blackspots is constantly changing as new telecommunications infrastructure is rolled out and upgraded.  The blackspot information that the Department has received so far is providing data regarding poor coverage in specific rural areas and along national and regional roads. The Department is continuing to work with the telecommunications providers to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted at the areas most in need. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Focus Group was established earlier this year by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the Focus Group was published in August 2018 and sets out a ranked list of categories of location where high quality mobile coverage should be available. It also recommends the level (in terms of quality and reliability) of coverage needed for these locations with respect to mobile voice and data services.</p></reply>

This year, funding of up to &euro;50,000 has been provided to each local authority to support the work of the PPNs, supplemented by a minimum of &euro;30,000 per annum from each authority&rsquo;s own resources.  In addition, my Department continues to support the on-going development of the PPNs, through supporting the work of the National Advisory Group, the provision of a data base, and the development of a User Guide. </p><p>The principal role of the National PPN Advisory Group is to monitor and evaluate PPNs regularly in line with best practice. Along with its monitoring role, the Advisory Group is also charged with advising and supporting the Department of Rural and Community Development in the further development of PPNs.  The 2017 PPN Annual Report makes a number of recommendations which will be considered by the National Advisory Group as part of its ongoing work programme.  These include a national publicity campaign to promote awareness and understanding of the PPNs, a review of the PPN Guidelines and structures and extra administrative resources to support the PPN development role.</p><p>PPNs have now been established in all local authority areas. Some are more firmly established than others, largely reflecting the timing of setting up arrangements, recruitment of resource workers and the formation of the various groupings required for PPNs to function.<b></b></p><p>In 2017, almost 13,000 organisations were members of 29 local PPNs surveyed. PPNs have developed communications activities to increase awareness of the organisation right across the community. This is rolled out to members and communities through various communication channels, including e-bulletins, social media, websites, promotional materials, local events and local radio.</p><p>PPN's are currently updating their membership database and are using this opportunity to identify and actively target community and voluntary groups that are not currently members of the PPN.  There is a strong emphasis on engaging with the most marginalised members of communities that are not currently represented by any group in the PPN structures.</p></reply>

The CEDRA report was published in April 2014. The priority recommendation made by CEDRA was the need for a co-ordinated approach to rural development across Government, led by a Cabinet Minister. </p>  <p>  The 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment to appoint a Government Minister and Department to provide greater political coordination and prioritisation of the work of other Departments in relevant areas that impact on rural Ireland.  The assignment of these responsibilities to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in May 2016, and the subsequent establishment of the dedicated Department of Rural and Community Development in July 2017, has addressed this priority recommendation of CEDRA and has ensured representation at Cabinet for rural and community development issues.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development which was published in January 2017 builds on, and goes further than, the CEDRA report in that it seeks to address not just the economic development of rural areas, but also seeks to support the social and cultural development of rural communities across the country.  Many of the recommendations in the CEDRA report which had not yet been implemented were integrated into the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department recently reviewed all of the recommendations in the CEDRA report and found that the recommendations have either been implemented, where feasible, or are being addressed through the Action Plan for Rural Development or other Government initiatives.</p></reply>

A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is underway in my Department at present, following the publication of a  Request for Proposals on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in May.

Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32 million for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet. It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan provides for a Capital allocation of &euro;541 million for Defence for the five year period 2018-2022.  This allocation will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as set out in the White Paper.  The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included.</p></reply>

We have voted in support of this resolution on all of the 26 previous occasions that it has been put forward by Cuba. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on the United States&rsquo; trade embargo of Cuba is long-standing and clear. We believe that the embargo serves no constructive purpose.  Ireland, along with the other member states of the EU, is firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the Cuban economy to the benefit of the Cuban people. </p>  <p>  Ireland objects to unilaterally imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba and that are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade. Ireland believes that the economic embargo seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and negatively affects its people.</p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward to receiving the draft resolution from Cuba on 31 October this year, and will review and consider the resolution as on the previous 26 occasions.  </p>  <p>  As well as bilateral engagement with Cuba, Ireland also engages with Cuba by way of the EU-Cuba relationship. The EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement marks an important point in this relationship.  The Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s first bilateral agreement with Cuba, and will improve conditions for EU-Cuba trade and investment.  The EU is Cuba&rsquo;s second most important trading partner, Cuba&rsquo;s biggest external investor and the source of one third of the 3.5 million tourists visiting the island each year.  </p>  <p>  I view the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement as an important step in further developing our relationship with Cuba. While most of the agreement has been provisionally applied since November 2017, its full application requires ratification by the EU once all member States have completed their own internal legal procedures.  As of now, fourteen member states have notified that they have done so. On the bilateral front, Ireland and Cuba will meet for Political Consultations on 1 October in Dublin.  We are in the process of completing our own internal legal procedures, and the EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement will be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for ratification once it has been debated by the Select Committee of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I have requested officials in my Department that they ensure that the notification process is fully completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The right to freedom of expression and to peaceful demonstration are fundamental to a functioning democracy. I wholeheartedly condemn the use of violence and intimidation, and the arbitrary detention of citizens attempting to peacefully express their views.  The recent events in Nicaragua are deeply concerning. The recent expulsion of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) following the publishing of its report detailing the worrying human rights abuses that have taken place in the country, was yet another troubling development. </p>  <p>  I call on the Nicaraguan Government to seriously consider the findings of the OHCHR report and take urgent action to implement its recommendations. I would also urge it to allow the OHCHR officials to re-enter the country and continue their valuable work.  Their presence is fundamental for the restoration of trust to all parties.  Full co-operation and access should also be given to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Ireland engages on this issue regularly at EU and UN level, and supports the clear EU position and strong statements on the situation. Ireland also supports EU action taken to support international and local initiatives to address the human rights situation, promote a culture of peace, and to provide support to victims of the crisis and their families, including by advocating for the release of those arbitrarily detained, among them the Belgian-Nicaraguan national referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  I believe that inclusive dialogue remains the only way of negotiating a peaceful and democratic resolution to this crisis, and of restoring the trust of the Nicaraguan people in the country&rsquo;s institutions. I encourage all relevant actors in Nicaragua to fully engage in the National Dialogue.   Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and in the Embassy of Ireland to Mexico, which is responsible for Ireland&rsquo;s relations with Nicaragua, will continue to monitor the situation in Nicaragua and engage with human rights defenders and civil society organisations working on the ground.</p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s negotiating approach remains as set out in the European Council Guidelines of April 2017 and March 2018. The Government has been consistently clear that Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, in order to minimise the impact on our trade and economy. At the same time, it is vital to our economic interests that the EU's Single Market and Customs Union are fully protected.    The Government acknowledged in June that the Chequers/White Paper proposals represented a useful contribution, but that much detailed analysis and discussion was required.</p>  <p>  As reported by the EU Chief Negotiator, Michel Barnier, at the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on 18 September, in early discussions there has been a convergence of views in some areas, notably on future EU-UK cooperation on foreign policy and security, both internal and external. However, it is also clear that there are very substantial differences, in particular relating to the proposed future economic partnership.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, stated in Salzburg last week that the proposals on the future economic partnership will not work, not least because they risk undermining the Single Market.</p>  <p>  It is now for the two sets of negotiators to take forward their work on the framework for the future relationship on the most intensive basis possible. At the same time, it remains essential, as underlined at Salzburg, that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, is also concluded speedily.</p></reply>

To qualify for the scheme an applicant must be in possession of a primary medical certificate, which can be obtained from a Senior Medical Officer of the HSE, if an applicant meets one of the medical criteria set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.    </p>  <p>  It is important to note that an applicant who is unsuccessful in securing a primary medical certificate can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.

NARPS purchases properties directly from NAMA debtors and receivers at market value and then onward leases these properties to local authorities and approved housing bodies on long term (20 year 9 months) leases, which include an option for the local authorities or approved housing bodies to purchase the units at market value during the latter part of the lease term. NARPS is a NAMA Group company and, as with other NAMA activities, its activities are considered to be off-balance sheet as far as Government accounting is concerned. </p>  <p>  The NARPS portfolio is restricted to properties purchased from NAMA&rsquo;s debtors and receivers. Given that NAMA is now well advanced on its deleveraging programme, there is limited scope for the portfolio to expand further over the next three years.

Section 10(2) provides that a residential property is not liable to LPT where it is situated in an unfinished housing estate and is contained in a list prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The list is included in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 91 of 2013).</p>  <p>  The qualifying conditions are set out in detail on the LPT portal at www.revenue.ie and property owners have been consistently advised to check to ensure that their actual properties are included in the &lsquo;prescribed list&rsquo; regardless of their location within an unfinished estate.  If they have any doubt about their entitlement to an exemption, they are advised to contact the LPT Helpline.</p>  <p>  Revenue conducts ongoing compliance programmes which include the review of LPT exemptions claimed.  When the exemption claimed on the property of the person concerned was reviewed by Revenue, it was established that it was incorrectly claimed, as the property was not on the &lsquo;prescribed list&rsquo; of exempt properties.  A letter was sent by Revenue to the person advising her that she had incorrectly claimed the exemption and that the property was now liable to LPT for all years 2013 to 2018 inclusive (a total of &euro;508).  She was also invited to contact Revenue to discuss any aspect of the matter, if she needed.</p>  <p>  I have been assured that if the payment of the arrears creates a difficulty for the person concerned, Revenue will be happy to discuss and agree a mutually acceptable phased payment arrangement.</p></reply>

Article 308 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that: &ldquo;The members of the European Investment Bank shall be the Member States&rdquo;. As a result, the UK will not remain a member of the EIB after it leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  Once the UK stops being a shareholder of the EIB, the capital it has provided to the EIB will no longer be part of the Bank&rsquo;s subscribed capital base. In recent months, the shareholders of the EIB, including Ireland, have been actively discussing means by which the capital base of the EIB can be strengthened to compensate for the loss of the UK shareholding. This may include, redenomination of some reserves and potentially an adjustment in the shareholdings of the EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Assuming a positive outcome and applying the provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement on the repayment of the UK&rsquo;s capital, the effect of UK withdrawal on EIB&rsquo;s operations and financial capacity should be mitigated.

However, they have provided the following general information in relation to the administration and audit of claims for the film tax credit under Section 481, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>  <p>  Under Section 481, in general terms a company which produces a film can claim a payable tax credit of 32% of the lower of:</p>  <p>  (a) the eligible expenditure incurred on producing a film,</p>  <p>  (b) 80% of the total cost of production of the film, or</p>  <p>  (c) &euro;70 million per film.</p>  <p>  The maximum credit a company can claim in respect of a film is therefore &euro;22.4 million.</p>  <p>  Eligible expenditure is the amount that the producer company spends in Ireland, wholly and exclusively on producing the film.  Amounts spent on the film outside of Ireland do not qualify for the tax credit.  However, where the credit is calculated based on 80% of the total cost of production, Revenue must have regard to the amounts incurred outside of the State as an increased global budget can lead to an increased credit.</p>  <p>  The company that claims the credit must be an Irish producer company.  The Irish work on the film must be carried out by a special purpose company which is wholly owned by that Irish producer company.  Where the film is not a fully Irish production, for example where it is a multi-jurisdictional production or a co-production, the Irish producer company will often organise the Irish production on behalf of an international production company.  In those cases, it is the international production company who has full knowledge of the global budget and of the make-up of the items in the Irish budget.  </p>  <p>  Recognising the potential risks presented, the administrative framework of the relief requires that a company&rsquo;s application for the credit must include:</p>  <p>  (a) an auditor&rsquo;s report detailing the eligible expenditure, the global budget and details of related party transactions, and</p>  <p>  (b) a solicitor&rsquo;s letter detailing that they have reviewed the legal agreements and that 68% of the funding has been lodged to the company&rsquo;s bank account (a requirement prior to Revenue releasing any amounts of the payable tax credit).</p>  <p>  The payable credit is available to a film that has been approved by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and which has been certified by Revenue.  Section 481 provides that Revenue may refuse to certify a film if they have reason to believe that the budget, or any part of the budget, is inflated.  They may also refuse to certify the film if they are not satisfied with the commercial rationale for the corporate structure used for financing, distribution and other similar activities.  As with all tax reliefs, the greatest risk of inflation is found in related party transactions including through corporate or financing structures that facilitate circular flows of cash.  </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the time taken to process applications for relief under Section 481 has increased in the last year, largely due to increased scrutiny on the expenses included within the &ldquo;eligible spend&rdquo; in 481 applications.  As the relief was restructured in 2015 from an investor-based relief to a corporation tax credit, the first films which have been made under this new format relief were being completed in 2017, which is when Revenue were first able to review the actual spend on completed films and the amounts being included in the claims for relief, as signed off by the auditors.  The largest adjustments arising from this review process are in respect of inflated related party expenditures, and discussions are ongoing between my Department, Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in relation to options to protect the Exchequer and give greater clarity to producers claiming the credit.</p>  <p>  The review of the film relief currently under way in my Department is a cost benefit analysis, due under the Tax Expenditure Review Guidelines.  The analysis is currently being finalised and is scheduled to be published on Budget day.</p></reply>

The exemptions apply to properties used as principal private residences.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the approximate number and value of claims to exemption under these categories, for years 2013 to 2018 inclusive, is as follows:</p><p>- New and unused purchases: 5,200 properties with total liability amounting to &euro;10 million*;</p><p>- Properties purchased or built as main residences during 2013: 11,700 properties with total liability amounting to &euro;25 million.</p><p>* Includes properties only where the liable person filed a return claiming the exemption. Where new and previously unused properties were purchased during the current valuation period (2013-2019) there is no obligation to file an LPT return as they are not liable to the tax until the next valuation period. Revenue does however capture data relating to new and previously unused properties on the LPT Register via Stamp Duty records and through various other information sources but they are not included here as they are considered not liable for 2013-2019.</p><p>As regards the number and value of self-built properties, Revenue does not collect such information as it is not relevant for LPT purposes. </p><p>The number of properties exempt from LPT up to Quarter 2 of 2018 by exemption category is available in the LPT statistics page on the Revenue website at </p></reply>

In last year&rsquo;s Budget I announced that in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment, mortgage interest relief for owner-occupiers would be extended on a tapered basis to end-2020 for the remaining recipients of the relief.  The process of phasing out mortgage interest relief for homeowners has been under way since 2009.</p>  <p>  With regard to mortgage holders that find themselves in mortgage difficulty, there are various supports available to them.  For example, the Abhaile service which was launched in October 2016 provides financial and legal advice and support to homeowners.  This Government funded mortgage arrears resolution service gives indebted borrowers access to State-funded panels of qualified and regulated financial or legal professionals to give advice and assistance on how to resolve their mortgage arrears via a voucher system.  The scheme has been very successful in helping those in long-term arrears and it is important to highlight that over 10,000 vouchers for consultations have issued since the scheme began in 2016.  It aims to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.</p>  <p>  The Insolvency Service of Ireland continues to assist distressed borrowers by returning them to solvency.  In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) cases, debtors have been able to remain in their homes.  The latest Insolvency Services Statistical Report for Q2 2018 shows that over 981 new applications were received in the quarter.  This high level of new applications has been maintained in large part because of the Abhaile Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which is part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Framework provides protections to consumers whose loans are in mortgage arrears.  It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.  I have asked the Central Bank to carry out a review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to ensure that it remains effective and I expect to receive a report from the Central Bank next month.</p>  <p>  The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) Scheme is a government initiative to help homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears.  To increase borrowers&rsquo; awareness and understanding of MTR a new dedicated mortgage to rent website, www.mortgagetorent.ie, has been developed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government together with the Housing Agency with input from the Abhaile Service and the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p></reply>

Farmers who elect to register for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT on costs incurred in relation to the farm business or they can remain unregistered and opt for the flat-rate scheme which is designed to reduce the administrative burden for farmers and to compensate them for the VAT borne on the purchases of goods and services relating to their activities.</p><p>The Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No 25) Order, 1993 provides for a refund of VAT incurred by unregistered farmers in the &ldquo;construction, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building or structure which is designed for use solely or mainly in his or her farming business&rdquo;.  The installation of security lighting would not of itself qualify for a refund of VAT under this Order but would qualify where it is a constituent element of qualifying construction work undertaken by an unregistered farmer.  Each claim for a refund of VAT under this Order is evaluated on its merits.</p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that a farmer would be entitled to write off the cost of installing security lighting against his/her farming income as it would qualify for capital allowances.  The cost may be written off over 8 years.</p><p>Where, however, a farmer does not have an entitlement to capital allowances e.g. s/he may be retired and no longer trading, relief may be available under the Home Renovation Initiative (HRI).  This provides income tax relief in the amount of 13.5% of the cost of certain repairs, renovations and improvements, carried out on a person's main residence.  The installation of security equipment such as security lighting comes within the terms of the Incentive.  It should, however, be noted that as relief under HRI is restricted to works carried out on a residence, the installation of security lighting to protect an out-building, or other non-residential part of a farm, would not qualify.</p><p>The relief is granted by way of a credit against income tax over the two years following the year in which the works are paid for. 50% of the relief is given in each year.  The key features of the scheme are that:-</p><p>- The works must be carried our by a tax compliant contractor;</p><p>- The works must be carried prior to 31 December 2018;</p><p>- Local Property Tax payments must be up to date in respect of the property;</p><p>- The cost of the works must be greater than &euro;4,405 and not more than &euro;30,000 (both figures exclusive of Value Added Tax).

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Thus the provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies, not dependent on any Government scheme and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These matters are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose and in fact are continually encouraged to shop around for the best price.  It is also my understanding that Insurance companies consider their pricing structure in accordance with their own past claims experience.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would highlight that the two schemes mentioned by the Deputy - the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) - both fall under the remit of the Minister of Housing, Planning and Local Government, while policy in respect of rent supplement payments is the responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></reply>

It does so in a progressively structured way which has a proportionately greater effect on higher value pensions.  </p>  <p>  A very significant part-unwinding of PSPR in three stages is taking place under the FEMPI Act 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR cuts on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  </p>  <p>  The cost of these FEMPI 2015 changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.  </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, provides for further significant lessening of the impact of PSPR by way of threshold and rate changes to apply on 1 January 2019 and 1 January 2020.  </p>  <p>  The cost of these changes is estimated at &euro;24 million in 2019 and &euro;12 million in 2020.  When fully in place from the beginning of 2020, these changes will mean that the vast majority of public service retirees, comprising everyone with occupational pension values up to at least &euro;54,000, will be entirely free of PSPR.  For those who retired since end-February 2012 that threshold will be even higher, at &euro;60,000.  Under section 27(3) of the Act, an order for the complete unwinding of PSPR, at an estimated additional cost of &euro;12m, must be made by 31st December 2020.  </p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.

My Department is strongly supportive of the promotion of positive mental health awareness in both primary and post-primary schools.  The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems including behavioural, emotional and social.<i></i></p><p>To support this holistic approach my Department has published a <i>Well-being Policy and Framework for Practice</i>(2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can promote student well-being.  It is the Department&rsquo;s aim that by 2023 all schools and centres for education will have embedded a dynamic Well-being Promotion Process<b><i></i></b>which promotes a whole school preventative approach to the promotion of well-being with interventions at both universal and targeted levels.  This approach is the most beneficial evidence informed approach for schools in the promotion of mental health and the support for students with mental health difficulties.  The Well-being Policy includes an Implementation Plan with seven high level actions to support the realisation of the policy.  Actions 2, 3 and 4 below focus on the need for the training of teachers which will include work with schools to ensure those students with most needs, including mental health needs, receive the highest level of support.  It is intended to:</p><p>- Plan and provide for the national roll-out of a professional development process to facilitate all schools and centres for education to engage with and embed a Well-being Promotion Process which builds professional capacity and collaborative cultures in schools from 2018-2023.</p><p>- Provide for an aligned, comprehensive and easily accessible programme of support for all schools and centres for education to address school-identified Well-being Promotion Needs.</p><p>- Consider how the system is meeting current and future teachers&rsquo; learning needs relating to well-being promotion.  </p><p>Support for implementation of the national <i>Well-Being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) </i>is also encompassed within the <i>Well-being Policy and Framework for Practice</i>implementation<i>.  </i></p><p>Responsibility for provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  Schools are advised to identify supports and services that are available in their community, build relationships and agree referral pathways for students needing referral.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides psychological support and engages in collaborative work helping school staff in how to access appropriate mental health services.  Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs.  Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies. </p><p>NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff. The guidelines <i>responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools</i>(2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment.  It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs.  The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community.  In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at the schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff and students.</p><p>A Well-being Steering Committee is overseeing the implementation of the <i>Well-being Policy Statement and Framework for Practice </i>within my Department.  It examines issues in relation to the co-ordination and aligning of the range of supports provided to schools in regard to well-being and mental health promotion.  This involves coordinating the liaison with other Departments and Government agencies. </p><p>The Policy includes a Well-being Implementation Plan and significant resources have been committed from  a number of sections of the Department.  NEPS capacity to enhance educational psychological service to schools has been increased through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists in the last academic year and a further 10 psychologists in 2018/19.  The focus of part of this additional support, in the context of primary schools, is on extending the delivery of training in the Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management Programme (IYTCM) and the Friends programmes to teachers in DEIS schools.  IYTCM aims to reduce behavioural difficulties and strengthen social and emotional competence in primary school-age children.  The Friends Programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in young people thus promoting mental health.  </p><p>The Department also works with the Department of Health to promote participation by primary and post-primary schools in the Health Promoting Schools initiative, which is supported by the Health Service Executive.  This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing on whole-school level conditions that affect health and well-being of children and young people. </p><p>Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or agency has been prioritised by Government.  My Department has been involved with the Taskforce on Youth Mental Health as part of the programme for Government.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to mental health promotion is the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies/services/NGOs involved.  The Task Force was established to produce a series of action-focused recommendations to improve youth mental health.  The main areas of focus comprised: emotional literacy and reduction of stigma; awareness of services and supports; accessibility to services and supports across different settings; alignment of services and supports across different providers; and building capacity in local communities.  The report has been published and a memorandum has been agreed the Government.</p><p>The work of implementing the Taskforce recommendations will be linked with the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project.  Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder Projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Youth Mental Health Pathfinder Project<b></b>is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects.  The aim is to strengthen management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies and ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. </p></reply>

This additional funding has provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the current school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total).  In addition, 400 Deputy Principal positions were created at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.</p>  <p>  Enabling teaching principals to have one release days per week would cost approximately &euro;12 million per annum.  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p></reply>

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, from 1 October 2018 the starting salary of a teacher will be &euro;36,318, and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, I welcomed, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. </p>  <p>  For example, a teachers hired in September 2011 would see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the recent outcome of the new entrant pay talks. </p></reply>

Each of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have selected an initial pilot area within their district, which they consider, based on census data and local knowledge, there exists a demand for more diversity in educational provision.  Surveys of parents of pre-school children have been carried out in these areas by the relevant City/County Childcare Committee on behalf of the ETBs.  ETBs, having analysed the survey results, draw up comprehensive reports on the position in relation to each of the 16 pilot areas. This forms the basis of discussions with the most prevalent patron/landowner in the area (the Catholic Bishop in most cases) concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school(s) to meet that demand.  The response by the landowner/patron to any identified demand for greater diversity is included in the report prepared by the ETB, for submission to my Department, who will subsequently publish the reports.  The publication of reports is expected to occur shortly.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the first round of reports, the Schools Reconfiguration process will move into the Implementation Phase.  This Phase involves consultation with local school communities on accommodating demand for diversity by transferring patronage of an existing school to a new multi-/non-denominational patron.  Draft protocols for the Implementation Phase are at an advanced stage of development and consultation with Catholic Church representatives is ongoing.</p>  <p>  A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised by ETBs when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed and any necessary adjustments made in the process. </p>  <p>  I believe that this new Schools Reconfiguration process, which involves the transfer of live schools, has the potential to significantly increase patronage diversity in our school system.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences crime or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, which was established in 2015, continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies. In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. </p><p>This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs. This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures.</p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-25a.393.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092500068#WRL04600"><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the manner in which any Garda operation is conducted is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I, as Minister, have no role in this regard. Similarly, the deployment of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  With regard to the incident in question, I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner, and was the subject of a High Court order directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it. The removal of individuals from the property was not conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to facilitate the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest. I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed initially and were later supported by a Garda Public Order Unit. </p>  <p>  I note Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s recent statement in relation to the protest and he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event. I also note that the Policing Authority will be pursuing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. </p>  <p>  The right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, it is also a right that must be exercised peacefully and with respect for the rights of others. In this context, we must not lose sight of the fact that the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were enforcing the law in what were very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been some disquiet about members of the Public Order Unit wearing hoods.  The Commissioner has said they should have been worn in conjunction with helmets and you will be familiar with public order police around the world wearing helmets in the course of their policing duties.</p>  <p>  It is a sad fact and a worrying development that Garda&iacute;, and particularly those who undertake public order policing, are frequently personally targeted and subjected to vile abuse and threats, particularly online.  At the protest itself, the Garda&iacute; were subject to sustained abuse, including in one incident, racist abuse, and I condemn that behaviour. Where behaviour crosses the line into criminality, it may be investigated but it would be preferable if the crime did not occur at all. I would appeal to people to recognise that Garda&iacute; simply doing their jobs should not be subjected to threats, intimidation or abuse.</p></reply>

However, in recent weeks demand has spiked and the number of people arriving in Ireland applying for international protection has increased even further.</p>  <p>  Due to this spike, full capacity was reached and RIA had to prioritise accommodation for families and other vulnerable persons who presented and were unable to offer immediate accommodation services to some people. The numbers who did not initially receive an offer of accommodation are relatively small and RIA has been working to meet their needs and indeed many have since been offered accommodation.  Further efforts to provide accommodation to international protection applicants will involve the opening of new accommodation centres.</p>  <p>  It is an extremely rare event for a person not to be offered accommodation in Ireland on arrival.</p>  <p>  To address current and future needs, advertisements have been placed in the national media seeking additional accommodation that must be fully compliant with the recommendations of the McMahon report. Quite separate to this, it is also engaged in an open competitive process to establish a framework of accommodation centres from which we can draw down accommodation as and when needed over the coming years.</p>  <p>  At the present time (September 2018), the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) has contracted approximately 5,800 beds, almost all of which are fully occupied.  It is currently accommodating some 600 persons in accommodation who have been granted a permission to remain in Ireland (and therefore are technically ineligible for free accommodation in Accommodation Centres).  Some of these have recently received a decision while others have received decisions several months and indeed a couple of years ago.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency has provided funding to NGOs to provide house-finding and support services to these residents to obtain permanent homes in the community. RIA also works with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on this issue.</p></reply>

This investment will allow delivery of a broad range of projects associated with the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as for decisions in relation to the allocation and management of Garda equipment and resources, including in relation to ICT.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  There are 565 operational Garda stations in the State.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that broadband networks and services are used to connect stations to the Garda network for official purposes.  All connections to Garda stations are managed in Telecommunications Division to ensure the speed of the network connection meets the requirements of the particular location.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a project to enhance network access to rural Garda stations is being progressed under the Modernisation and Renewal Programme.</p>  <p>  I understand that 111 stations are currently not connected to the Garda network.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that for operational reasons a list of the 111 stations concerned cannot be provided.</p>  <p>  However I can update the Deputy that of this total, I am informed that arrangements for connection of 34 stations are nearing completion.  Options are being explored to provide members attached to the remaining stations not yet networked with local access to Garda ICT services.  This includes an assessment of the availability or otherwise of local broadband services and/or the provision of mobile technology.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that any member attached to a currently unconnected Garda station can access PULSE at their local district station.  Members attached to non-networked locations can also contact the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC) or an associated networked station if required.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment.</p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes.  Further, it is important to note that many community CCTV schemes are up and running successfully nationwide.</p><p>I am also pleased to see that the numbers of new applications to the grant aid scheme administered by my Department are increasing - there have to date been 27 applications to the scheme, including 13 applications received this month. 6 applications have been approved.  18 applications are currently being considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>In establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General. There was also consultation regarding the scheme with stakeholders including County and City Management Association (CCMA), Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Irish Rural Link as well as interested community groups. </p><p>Nonetheless and in response to the queries or concerns expressed by some local authorities, my officials continue to engage on the matter in particular through the LGMA and the CCMA, to address any concerns and clarify any queries arising.  </p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns on the legislative basis for CCTV.  However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  We expect findings from this process to be of great assistance to local authorities as they carry out their function of Data Controller.</p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme administered by my Department.  Under the scheme, which is intended to run for 3 years with funding of some &euro;1 million being made available each year, eligible community groups can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p><p>Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address .</p></reply>

(but not less than the National Minimum Wage).</p><p>- Their prospective employer is not required to undertake a Labour Market Needs Test.</p><p>The situation in relation to the immigration Stamp for immediate family members of non-EEA nationals is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  My officials are in consultation with officials in the Department of Justice and Equality on options to offer greater clarity to prospective employers on the position in relation to the dependants, partners and spouses of Critical Skills Employment Permit holders.</p></reply>

Site visits are collated by the IDA on a county-by-county basis only and are released every quarter. Information on the number of site visits per month to specific locations is therefore unavailable. </p>  <p>  With regards to the Castlebar facility, this building is now completed and is being actively marketed to IDA clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas.  The Agency does not, on account of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, release details of specific site visit itineraries of potential investors.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all counties of Ireland to its client base.  It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned.  It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as at least 70% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) comes from existing client companies of the Agency.    </p>  <p>  The overall outlook for FDI in County Mayo remains positive.  There are 16 IDA client companies employing 4,462 in total in the County. Mayo has experienced a 26% increase in FDI employment from 2012 to 2017 with job numbers increasing from 3,537 in 2012 to 4,462 at the end of last year.  IDA Ireland continues to engage with its existing client base to support them in growing their business and footprint further in County Mayo.</p></reply>

The Act applies to both written and oral construction contracts, although some do not fall within its remit, for example, if the value of a contract is not more than &euro;10,000.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide new legal rights and obligations on the parties to a construction contract.  The Act imposes minimum contractual provisions in relation to payments, particularly the timing of payments and the parties to a relevant construction contract cannot opt out of the provisions of the legislation.  The Act also prohibits the practice of &lsquo;pay when paid&rsquo;, except in the circumstance of a third party to a contract becoming insolvent.  </p>  <p>   The Act provides specific deadlines for a subcontractor to submit payment claim notices.  On receipt of same, payment must be made to a subcontractor within 30 days.  If a subcontractor is not paid the amount due under the contract in full and within 30 days, s/he has the right to suspend work until full payment is made.  In addition, a subcontractor also has the right to refer such a payment dispute to adjudication.</p>  <p>  The Act therefore provides important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry.  For it to achieve its intended purpose, it is important that subcontractors exercise their rights under the legislation to ensure they receive full payment for work carried out under a construction contract.   </p>  <p>  My Department will continue both to monitor the effectiveness of the legislation and to consult with key construction sector stakeholders as to its ongoing impact.</p></reply>

NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p><p>Key to the delivery of the Action Plan is the ongoing collaboration between the NTPF and the HSE and individual hospitals to identify solutions for long waiting patients.  The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.  To date this year, the NTPF has approved eight Urology submissions which has resulted in the treatment of over 1,400 patients. </p><p>Overall, the Inpatient/Daycase waiting list for Urology has reduced by over 1,100 patients since August 2017 with improvements across the 6-24 month timebands. </p><p>Nationally, the Outpatient Waiting List remains a significant challenge to be addressed in 2018.  The Outpatient Waiting List for Urology has seen an increase of over 1,700 patients since August 2017.</p><p>My Department, in consultation with the HSE and the NTPF, is in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for the remainder of 2018 which I hope to publish soon.  The Plan will include the trialling of a number of NTPF funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics.</p></reply>

It stated that the aggregate level of vacancies for consultant posts at the end of 2017 and evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications, suggest a general difficulty recruiting consultants and that the two-tier pay system was among a number of factors raised with it as affecting recruitment.  It also stated that the policy responses it expected for new entrants across the public services generally would be unlikely to address the degree of pay differential which applied to new entrant consultants.  The Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address this difficulty. </p>  <p>  New entrant consultants&rsquo; are encompassed by the process announced yesterday for new entrants across the public service under Section 4 of the Public Service Stability Agreement and will benefit accordingly.  However there will continue to be a pay differential between pre-existing and new entrant consultants.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has noted the Commission's views that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants.  The challenge will be doing so in a manner that respects pay policy and our budgetary constraints.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  As Minister for Health, I do not have any statutory power or function in relation to reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the 2013 Act, if a company wishes to have a medicine reimbursed through the community drugs schemes, it must submit an application to the HSE to have the medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the 2016 Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine or refuse to reimburse it.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily available for public patients in Ireland, but innovative approaches must be compatible with the statutory provisions in place and must also recognise fundamental pricing and funding issues, in the context of finite Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

For example, the reference basket of countries, used to set drug prices in Ireland, has been expanded from 9 to 14 countries, including lower cost countries. Also, the Agreement now provides for an annual price realignment, so that Irish medicine prices can be reduced in line with price reductions across the reference countries.  This will ensure the State achieves better value for money on medicines as prices in other basket countries are adjusted downwards over time. In addition, the Agreement provides for a 30% reduction in the price of biologic medicines when a biosimilar medicine enters the market.</p><p>A key focus of this agreement is to achieve lower prices in the face of both demographic pressures on expenditure and the continued development of new medicines, many of which pose affordability challenges to the Irish health service and internationally.</p><p>The estimated saving for 2019 from the Agreement is &euro;203 m.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements  in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons  with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out  by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and  Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility  and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Under this Plan the Children's Hospital Group used a combination of insourcing of surgical procedures within the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) and the broader public hospital sector, as well as outsourcing initiatives, including private providers nationally and abroad. </p>  <p>  As part of the outsourcing initiative, two hospitals in the UK and two in Europe were engaged to undertake spinal fusion surgery. In 2017, 28 surgeries were completed in these hospitals.</p>  <p>  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has advised that as part of the outsourcing initiative this year families were offered the opportunity to have their children&rsquo;s surgery abroad but did not avail of the offer as they did not want to travel abroad. </p>  <p>  They further advise that one child did have their surgery abroad in 2018, this was scheduled to have taken place in late 2017 but it was deferred until 2018.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has advised that as capacity has increased in its hospitals during 2018 there has not been the demand to send patients abroad for surgery.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the HSE operates the Cross-Border Directive (CBD) in Ireland.  Under the terms of the Directive, patients of an EU/EEA Member State who meet the necessary criteria may opt to avail of healthcare provided under the legislation of their Member State of affiliation in another EU/EEA Member State and be reimbursed the lesser of the cost of receiving the treatment abroad, or the cost in their own Member State. The HSE advise that Scoliosis surgery is not accessible via the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS). </p>  <p>  In 2017 waiting times for scoliosis related surgery reduced for the first time in a number of years.  This has continued in 2018 with the investment in paediatric orthopaedics this year, to include scoliosis services, which has already improved access for surgery and out-patient review to address the lengthy waiting times experienced by children and young people with scoliosis. </p>  <p>  The impact of investment is now starting to deliver results with a consistent reduction in waiting times being recorded.  The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group advise that already this year 319 spinal surgeries have been carried out and they are on course to meet the year of end target of 446 surgeries while at the same time dealing with the 291 children who have been added to the waiting list for scoliosis surgery this year.  </p></reply>

It must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this. </p><p>The policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. Under the Plan, a new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 under the Chair of the Department of Health. It is comprised of representatives from a range of Government Departments and Agencies - including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p><p>Step 2 of the OPAP is <i>Regulate for a healthier environment</i>. One of the Actions under this Step is to &quot;Develop guidelines and support material for those working in developing the built environment for urban development and planning in relation to reducing the obesogenic environment&quot;. The OPAP recognised that changing the obesogenic environment is a critical factor underpinning the success of maintaining the population at a healthy weight. The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles. The OPAP acknowledged that food and retail outlets are more widely available now than every before and that this becomes important as children have discretionary income and may not follow the healthy eating guidelines. It therefore declared that it is important that the health input into the local area planning process is consistent and evidence based. </p><p>This area is being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.</p><p>In line with Actions 31 and 59 of the National Physical Activity Plan, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity (31), and to develop a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement to ensure delivery of the Plan (59), it is intended to hold a Stakeholder Forum in November this year. The planned Forum will focus on the theme of the Built Environment.</p><p>Planning for the Forum is at an advanced stage, and a number of individuals - including key representation from the initiative referred to by the Deputy - have been approached with regard to giving presentations at the Forum. A wide range of stakeholders will be invited to the Forum, comprising key representatives from health, sport, planning, environment, local government and others. Full details of the Forum will be available once finalised. </p><p>Finally, the question of legislation around planning matters for the issue raised by the Deputy is ultimately a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government,  and I understand that he has addressed the position on this in his reply to Parliamentary Question 34831/17. For convenience a link to this question is here .</p></reply>

Work to identify the precise capital funding requirement is ongoing.  The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and therefore the funding requirement will vary from year to year.  In that context, the Implementation Plan will inform the annual Estimates process each year.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm that additional funding of &euro;4.15 million is being provided to the Programme this year to progress implementation of the Strategy.

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised. </p>  <p>  Currently, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period.  This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring market access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. National Farm Survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

This is a very positive reflection on organic farming in Ireland and it mirrors a growing trend across Europe and globally.  This trend suggests that there is further potential in the sector but in order to grow sustainably it must be market driven. We need to focus on how we can further grow the market and explore all opportunities such as growing exports.  In this way we can ensure that the sector remains competitive and that organic producers receive a worthwhile premium for their product.</p></reply>

This scheme was offered by the EU Commission to Member States to implement on a voluntary basis to allow producers who had incurred super levy debt to spread the cost over three years (2015&ndash;2017) interest free.  </p>  <p>  At the end of the milk quota regime in April 2015 Ireland exceeded its quota by 4.4%, resulting in a super levy bill of &euro;71 million for 6,400 Irish farmers.  Each Member State was obliged to settle the liability in full in 2015 with the EU Commission and could then re-coup the money from its farmers as per the scheme.  My Department chose to implement the scheme on the basis that it would minimise the burden on the sector during a period of planned expansion here as well as helping with the immediate cash flow difficulties for farmers faced with such a bill.</p>  <p>  My Department introduced the scheme of phased recoupment from farmers who had the option of joining the scheme and spreading their repayment over three years. This repayment schedule took the form of a 33% lump sum in 2015 and the balance to be spread over five equal instalments in 2016 and 2017 over the peak production period of May to September.  Ireland was one of the few Member States with a super levy bill to introduce the scheme.</p>  <p>  This scheme was financed from Exchequer funds and so my Department is responsible for ensuring that the funds advanced to the Commission on behalf of farmers are recouped on behalf of the taxpayer.  </p>  <p>  The person in question incurred a superlevy fine because they supplied almost double their assigned quota in the 2014/15 quota year.  They are subject to the same conditions regarding interest which apply to all participants of the scheme and they are strongly encouraged to engage with the relevant officials in my Department to resolve the issue.</p></reply>

This update has taken longer than originally anticipated in order to reflect policy developments &ndash; including the National Mitigation Plan, the National Development Plan, and the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package. </p>  <p>  As part of the EU&rsquo;s Clean Energy Package, the recently agreed Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action stipulates that all Member States must develop a draft National Energy and Climate Plan and submit it to the European Commission by the end of 2018. </p>  <p>  The scope of the National Energy and Climate Plan covers the full energy system and requires a high level of detail on all sectors, fuels, policies, and support measures. It will, therefore, encompass the policies and measures that would be set out in any revision of the Draft Bioenergy Plan. My Department is currently considering how best to integrate both planning and consultation processes.</p></reply>

Article 5 of the Directive provides for the exemplary role of public bodies buildings and includes achieving an annual rate of energy efficient renovation for Government buildings of 3%.  The directive allows for this to be achieved either through renovation or by &ldquo;alternative measures&rdquo;.  Ireland has chosen the alternative approach which entails a mix of energy management and efficiency upgrade measures.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has however set a more ambitious energy efficiency objective for our public sector.  When Government set our national 20% target the public sector (which includes schools and local authorities) was given a more ambitious target of 33% which goes beyond the 3% renovation requirement in the EU directive.  Progress has been good with a 20% improvement in energy efficiency achieved across the public sector by end 2016.  The cumulative savings from 2009 to 2016 amount to 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions reduction and &euro;737m in energy spend avoided.</p>  <p>  In the case of my own Department we achieved approximately 20% energy efficiency improvement by end 2016 with a 31% efficiency improvement over the same period for our group.  I am confident this performance will be further enhanced when the next performance report issues late this year.  Details of efficiencies achieved by all public bodies are available online in the Annual Report on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance available on the SEAI website.  </p>  <p>  To further drive the effort required to achieve the 33% target, I published the first Government approved Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2017.  The Strategy introduces new governance structures and enhanced support measures, and provided clarity on the retention of financial savings achieved by public sector bodies from the energy efficiency measures they implement.  </p>  <p>  Since we launched the Strategy all government departments have appointed a designated Energy Performance Officer (EPO) to drive the Strategy and provide the necessary strategic leadership to the bodies within their groups.  My Department, along with the SEAI, and the OPW have been engaging pro-actively with Departments and their EPO&rsquo;s through workshops and individual advisory sessions.  The main focus is to support EPO's to work with the bodies in their sector to identify and develop energy efficiency projects and avail of the advice and supports available.  </p>  <p>  Since 2017, I have provided &euro;14m in funding to the SEAI to engage and work with the OPW and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills on two pilot projects.  These are delivering energy retrofit upgrades, and crucially, informing and developing replicable and scalable models for energy retrofit investment that can be more widely deployed.  In parallel the SEAI is working with the higher education and healthcare sectors to develop significant projects and continues, along with my Department, to support the City &amp;amp; County Management Association in developing the National Public Lighting Upgrade Programme, which has the potential to more than halve local authority electricity use.</p></reply>

Three international experts in the field of electricity infrastructure development carried out a comprehensive analysis of international developments in undergrounding technologies since the publication of the International Expert Commission report in 2012. This was a key request of the representatives of the communities concerned about the proposed overhead line development.  </p>  <p>  The North South Interconnector is critical to ensuring a safe, secure supply of electricity throughout the island of Ireland. It also supports the core objectives of European and national energy policy &ndash; namely sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. </p>  <p>  The second study is focused on the levels of compensation provided to land and property owners in proximity to high-voltage transmission lines in a European context.​ This study was undertaken to consider a separate concern raised by public representatives at meetings with me - the impact of transmission lines on land and property values and the level of compensation paid in lieu of such impacts. Levels of compensation provided to land and property owners are considered to be a reflection of the impact of transmission lines on land and property values, so this study, undertaken by KHSK Economic Consultants, analysed the compensation regimes in other European and selected international countries. </p>  <p>  Both studies are now completed and have been submitted to me.  </p>  <p>  In order to have the most up-to-date assessment of implications of Brexit on the energy sector before bringing the reports to Government, I sought views of the energy regulator and electricity and gas transmission system operators on the implications for the electricity market in Ireland in the event of a hard "Brexit", including for the SEM, for timelines for the delivery of programmes such as DS3 and the NSIC and for continued secure cross-border electricity trading across interconnectors.  The outcome of this analysis was submitted to my Department recently and is being considered. </p>  <p>  It has always been my intention to bring the relevant reports to Government for consideration prior to their publication and I expect to do this shortly.</p></reply>

My Department has published on its website analysis of Brexit issues and hosted public and industry meetings and events. In line with efforts across Government to further intensify preparedness, I sought the views of the energy regulator, CRU, and the electricity and gas transmission system operators, EirGrid and Gas Networks Ireland respectively, on the implications of various Brexit scenarios for the electricity and gas markets in Ireland. These reports have been received and are currently under consideration. The reports identify market challenges absent an agreement between the EU and the UK on energy trading post Brexit, as trade with UK will become a market that straddles a EU Member State and a Third Country. From the outset we have identified continued secure energy trade with the UK as a priority and the detailed material now received will input to our engagement with the EU as it progresses negotiation. This material also addresses an issue raised by EU officials in June this year when further details on how a range of Brexit scenarios would impact Irish energy policy were sought by the Commission. This included how a 'hard Brexit' may impact the Single Electricity Market. Our Brexit contingency and preparedness planning is well advanced.</p>  <p>  Last week Minister Coveney, on behalf of the Government, announced details of the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes whole-of-Government public outreach events and will provide information on the latest preparedness and support measures being taken by Government. </p></reply>

While there is an error in the legislation, it is not that suggested in the question.</p>  <p>  Drivers who fail an impairment test will be arrested under section 4 or section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  These sections deal respectively with intoxication offences related to driving and being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle.  </p>  <p>  The actual error in the legislation relates to the substitution of section 11 of the 2010 Act - the section which is the basis for impairment testing - in the Road Traffic Act 2016.  Section 11 empowers Garda&iacute; to conduct impairment tests and makes it an offence if a person, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with a requirement to undergo an impairment test.  The section empowers Garda&iacute; to arrest without warrant a person guilty of failing to comply with such a request.</p>  <p>  The difficulty arises because the 2016 revision of section 11 changed the internal numbering of subsections.  The power of arrest for someone who failed to comply with a request to conduct an impairment test was originally in section 11(5) and is now in section 11(6).  References elsewhere in the legislation to procedure following arrest under section 11(5) should now refer to procedure following arrest under section 11(6).</p>  <p>  References in sections 13A and 13B to section 11(5) were corrected to refer to section 11(6) by section 2(a) and (b) of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, which will be commenced on 26 October.  These will allow Garda&iacute; to conduct preliminary oral fluid tests for drugs and evidential blood tests for drugs where people have been arrested under section 11(6).</p>  <p>  Subsequently, it has been noted that similar changes will be required to references in section 12 - obligation to provide blood, breath or urine specimens following arrest - and section 16 - power to detain people after arrest where they might pose a danger to themselves or others.  These will be corrected in the forthcoming Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it is important to note that a person convicted under section 11 for failure to comply with a request to undergo and impairment test is liable to a fine up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 and/or up to six months in prison.  They will also be subject to a consequential disqualification of at least 1 year.  It is not therefore the case that people in this position can evade the consequences of their actions.</p></reply>

It states:</p><blockquote>Where a child is in the care of a health board, the health board shall provide such care for him, subject to its control and supervision, in such of the following ways as it considers to be in his best interests-<br /><br />by placing him with a foster parent<br /><br />by placing him in a residential centre<br /><br />where a child is eligible for adoption by placing him with a suitable person with a view to adoption by making such other suitable arrangements (which may include placing the child with a relative) as the health board thinks proper.</blockquote><p>The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations 1995 stipulate that all children who require foster care are placed with persons chosen from a panel of persons who are willing to act as foster parents.  They set out conditions to be met to be placed on such a panel which include:A written assessment of their suitability, having been considered by a foster care committee who are satisfied that they are suitable persons to act as foster parents.</p><p>These regulations further charge TUSLA with responsibility for matching children with foster carers chosen for their capacity to meet children&rsquo;s assessed needs. These needs are identified as encompassing the children&rsquo;s emotional, psychological, medical, educational, physical care, identity, ethnicity, religious, safety and security needs.  </p><p>The National Standards for Foster Care (2003) 14(a) require that foster care applicants participate in a comprehensive assessment of their ability to carry out the fostering task and are formally approved prior to any child or young person being placed with them.</p><p>Standard 23 of The National Standards for Foster Care (2003) stipulates that foster care committees recommend whether or not to place applicants&rsquo; names on their panel of approved foster carers.</p><p>This task is underlined in the HSE National Policy, Procedures and Best Practice Guidance for HSE Foster Care Committees, 2012 which sets out the criteria for acceptance of foster care applicants.</p><p>The only exception to the assessment process relates to the emergency placement of children in care with relatives.  In these circumstances children can be placed with relatives without an assessment having taken place.This is governed by the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations 1995, article 6 (1):</p><blockquote>Where a health board is satisfied that the immediate placement of a child in its care with his or her relatives is in the interests of the child, the board my, notwithstanding that one or more of the provision of article 5 of these Regulations have not been complied with in relation to the relative place the child with those relatives provided the board is of the option after having caused-(a) the relatives to be interviewed and their home to be visited by an authorised person and <br /><br />(b) such other enquiries as are practicable to be made in the particular circumstances of the case that the relatives are suitable persons to take care of the child on behalf of the board.</blockquote><p>An assessment process will commence with the potential relative foster carers following the placement of the child in these emergency circumstances.</p><p>I hope this information clarifies the current position in relation to the  assessment of foster carers. </p></reply>

These obligations include: a requirement to keep children safe from harm while they are availing of the service; a requirement to carry out a risk assessment, and, a requirement to prepare a child safeguarding statement which sets out the policies and procedures which are in place to mitigate these risks. </p>  <p>  The Act operates side-by-side with the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  The guidance sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition.  It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla.  It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe.  It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to.  These guidelines have been in place since 1999 and were fully revised and published in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  The statutory obligations in the Children First Act apply to both public and private sector organisations providing relevant services to children operating in this jurisdiction, regardless of where an organisation&rsquo;s governing body is located.  The relevant services to children that attract an obligation to produce a child safeguarding statement are set out in schedule 1 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Sections 12 and 13 of the Act make provision for the Child and Family Agency to establish and maintain a register of non-compliance for providers of relevant services who fail to provide a copy of the Child Safeguarding Statement to Tusla when requested to do so.  A new Child Safeguarding Compliance Unit has recently been established within Tusla.  As this is a new statutory obligation for many organisations, Tusla is focusing on encouraging and supporting providers of relevant services to meet their statutory obligations and it will endeavour only to place relevant service providers on the register where a supportive approach has proved unsuccessful. </p>  <p>  In addition, section 27 requires each Government Department to prepare and publish a sectorial implementation plan that outlines the programme of measures to be taken to ensure that the Department, and any body that provides a relevant service and receives funding from that Department, comply with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  The key principle of Children First is that child protection issues are the responsibility of all and that child safety and welfare concerns must be dealt with as and where they arise.  In this regard the specific issues raised by the Deputy relating to sporting organisations come within the remit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

Attempts by Tusla to secure continuing commercial cover have proved unsuccessful. However, I am pleased to confirm that pending a permanent solution, all foster carers have an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  This is on an ex-gratia basis as a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, I fully support extending the State Indemnity Scheme under the State Claims Agency to foster parents.  Unfortunately, this has taken longer than expected due to technical issues associated with the approvals and statutory process involved, but I can assure the Deputy that work is continuing to address these matters. My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible. In this regard, work is ongoing with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the necessary Order for Government. </p>  <p>  My Department has written to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) outlining the position and, through the Association, foster carers have been informed as to the current position. IFCA have been kept up to date on a continuous basis. In addition, I understand that Tusla has also made publicly available the information provided to IFCA so as to communicate the position to those foster carers who are not members of that association.</p></reply>

Once the report is screened, a strategy meeting is held with the Social Work Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and where relevant,  the identified service which offers credibility and therapeutic services in the catchment area, such as St Claire&rsquo;s Unit.  At this meeting a decision is reached regarding which service would be most suitable for the child. The available options are:1) A Joint Specialist Interview, with Garda&iacute; taking the lead role. 2) A referral to a Specialist Unit such as St Claire&rsquo;s Unit.3) The Social Work Department completing the assessment. When an assessment is completed by a Specialist Unit, Tusla receives a comprehensive report outlining the specific details, including an analysis of the findings. The assessment reports are forwarded to the Principal Social Worker, Team Leader and referring social worker who then review the findings. Tusla generally accept the findings of the specialised unit unless there are specific circumstances raising concern. The outcome of a completed assessment is either &lsquo;Founded&rsquo; or &lsquo;Unfounded.&rsquo;  Tusla relies on this outcome to determine what further intervention is required.</p>  <p>  Separately, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  have statutory responsibilities for the safety and welfare of children and the investigation of criminal complaints. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am not in a position to comment on the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to these matters.  However, I will reiterate that Tusla and specialist services are civil authorities that make findings, drawn from all available information, on the balance of probability.  This may differ from the burden of proof for criminal prosecution required for investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a primary responsibility to promote the safety and well-being of children. Everyone must be alert to the possibility that children with whom they are in contact may be suffering from abuse or neglect. This responsibility is particularly relevant for professionals such as teachers, child care workers, health professionals and those working with adults with serious parenting difficulties. It is also an important responsibility for staff and people involved in sports clubs, community activities, youth clubs, religious/faith sector and other organisations catering for children. Tusla should always be informed when a person has reasonable grounds for concern.</p></reply>

It has been decided to use the terms 'founded' and 'unfounded' to keep in line with international best practice. </p><p>In Children First, 2011, Section 5.5,  &lsquo;Unfounded Concerns&rsquo;, provides guidance on actions to be taken where, after an assessment or appeals process, concerns or suspicions of child abuse are considered as &lsquo;unfounded.&rsquo; </p><p>A &lsquo;founded&rsquo; assessment is an authentication that a judgement has been made that evidence exists which confirms that child abuse occurred. </p><p>An &lsquo;unfounded&rsquo; assessment is one where the evidence does not support a finding of abuse. It does not mean the abuse did not occur, rather that there is a lack of evidence to support a &lsquo;founded&rsquo; outcome. For example, there may be no convincing disclosure, no clear evidence, no witnesses, and/or no admission on the part of the Person Subject to Allegations of Abuse (PSAA).</p><p>The &lsquo;balance of probabilities&rsquo; is interpreted as the degree to which something is more likely to have occurred than not.  </p><p>The key principles informing decision-making when an assessment is being made  include the following:</p><p>a.

If a child is deemed to be at immediate serious risk the child's interest  takes priority over  the suspected person&rsquo;s right to be informed of allegations against him/her. </p><p>e.  If Tusla concludes there is an immediate serious risk to a child, this must be communicated to an appropriate relevant third party to enable Tusla to take whatever protective action is necessary</p><p>f.  Maintaining children in their own home is in their best interests. If the child is living with an alleged abuser, the safety of the child is paramount</p><p>g.  Social work professionals make a determination on a balance of probabilities </p><p>h.  Natural justice and fair procedures must be applied in relation to persons suspected of abuse, including their right to be informed about allegations against them and to respond </p><p>i.  A Tusla assessment should take representations made by a person suspected of abuse into account</p><p>j.  Any action or protection plan should be signed off by all relevant parties, including the person suspected of abuse, where possible.</p><p>k.  A person suspected of abuse has a right to have their data protection rights protected, to obtain legal advice, to see all relevant documentation, to submit relevant documentation, to make oral or written submissions and have these considered, to identify any third parties with relevant information for Tusla consideration for interview, and to request an independent review of the assessment undertaken by the social worker.</p></reply>

This can be achieved through the implementation of programmes and initiatives that facilitate and encourage economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs, and to support our communities to become and remain desirable places to live, work and raise families. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development in Ireland, and Project Ireland 2040 are the key policy initiatives that set out the ways in which Government aims to address disadvantage and how we can support both rural and urban communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Action Plan for Rural Development, which complements the Regional Action Plans for Jobs and other Government plans and strategies, includes a range of measures which will support enterprise growth and job creation in rural areas. These measures will be delivered across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations over the period to 2020. </p>  <p>  Improving the quality of life of those who live and work in rural communities is another key objective of the Action Plan, which is the most comprehensive Government plan ever produced to support economic and social development in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to employment, Labour market data published by the Central Statistics Office, for Quarter 4 2017, shows that employment increased in almost all regions of the country year-on-year. Two-thirds of the 19,332 new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland companies in 2017 were outside of Dublin, while all regions saw increases in IDA employment in 2017, with over 50% of the 19,851 new jobs created last year located outside of Dublin.  </p>  <p>  My own Department also contributes to supporting job creation and the enhancement of the quality of life in local communities through a range of programmes, including: </p>  <p>  - &euro;31.6 million has been invested in over 450 projects under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>  <p>  - &euro;23 million has been allocated to almost 500 projects under the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme.</p>  <p>  - More than 1,200 projects have been approved for total funding of &euro;25 million under the CL&Aacute;R programme.</p>  <p>  - 1,100 private roads in rural areas have benefitted from investment of &euro;28.2 million under the Local Improvement Scheme since last September; and</p>  <p>  - More than 1,300 projects with a value of over &euro;39 million have now been approved under the current LEADER programme. LEADER is a multi-annual programme which has a budget of &euro;250 million over the period to 2020 and has a job creation target of 3,100 over the lifetime of the programme. </p>  <p>  - &euro;190 million will be provided by the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme over the period 2018-2022. SICAP aims to reduce disadvantage and poverty in local communities across the country. </p>  <p>  - My Department is also working closely with local authorities to support the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan and rural telecommunications infrastructure. We are assisting local authorities to develop local digital strategies, which will be essential if the full economic and social benefits of high-speed broadband connectivity are to be realised equally across all communities over the coming years. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to implement these and other programmes but is also in a position to provide additional investment of &euro;1 billion over the next 10 years through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which is being delivered as part of the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 commitment to strengthen rural economies and communities.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development includes a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in rural areas. Specific examples of actions in the Plan which will help those who feel isolated or vulnerable in rural areas include:</p>  <p>  - Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based support for vulnerable older people living alone. During 2017, spend on the Scheme amounted to &euro;2.7 million, with over 12,600 applications approved and more than 10,000 installations completed. To the end of August 2018, almost 13,000 applications were approved, with in excess of 14,500 installations completed. Spend on this demand-led scheme to date in 2018 has been almost &euro;5.4 million.</p>  <p>  - Investment of &euro;46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime.</p>  <p>  - Support for 450 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across rural Ireland which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. In July I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds throughout Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in  rural areas.</p>  <p>  - Continued support and prioritisation of community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert. </p>  <p>  - Funding allocation of &euro;14.9 million for Local Link rural transport services in 2018. Local Link facilitated 1.9 million passenger journeys last year, providing a vital service for rural communities.  </p>  <p>  The issue of isolation, whether in urban or rural areas, is one which should concern us all and I am committed to continuing my Department&rsquo;s response to this issue through programmes such as Seniors Alert and progressing the measures contained in the Action Plan for Rural Development in collaboration with my Government colleagues.</p></reply>

The Department also approved a request from Volunteer Ireland for &euro;115,000 to update the I-VOL database, which will be provided on a recoupment basis. This upgrade will facilitate public online access to volunteering information and opportunities.</p><p>My Department also has lead responsibility for developing the relationship between the State and community and voluntary sector. The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged. The current three-year scheme runs to 30 June 2019, and all funding has been fully allocated for 2018. </p><p>The Community Services Programme (CSP), which has an allocation for 2018 of &euro;46million, supports community-based organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model for services which are not being met through public or private funding. </p><p>The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) was launched by my Department in May 2018.  It provides small capital grants to community groups across the country. The original allocation announced in May 2018 was &euro;4.5m and last week, I was able to announce a further allocation of &euro;8million to the CEP for 2018. An additional &euro;0.5m was allocated and ring-fenced for Men&rsquo;s Sheds in June of this year. </p><p>The programme allows communities across the country to apply for funding to enhance the facilities in their areas. Hundreds of groups are benefitting across the country in 2018 and money is being spent on what is important to people locally in their area. Co. Kildare has been allocated a total of &euro;442,585 under the CEP in 2018.</p><p>Voluntary groups in rural areas may also be able to access funding under the CL&Aacute;R Programme, which has allocated approximately &euro;23million to almost 500 small scale infrastructural projects  since 2016, in the areas of school and community safety, recreational play areas and first response support.

The Group currently meets on a monthly basis and has successfully facilitated the sharing of ideas and local knowledge, and established valuable networking opportunities between the Local Authorities and service providers.</p>  <p>  A key deliverable of the Regional Action Group is the development of local digital strategies in each Local Authority area. Indecon was appointed to assist Local Authorities in this process, with Digital Readiness Assessments prepared for each Local Authority. It is anticipated that the local digital strategies will be completed over the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department has also been engaged with broadband officers and telecommunications providers to assess the viability of sharing underground infrastructure. My officials are also working with broadband officers to develop pilot projects which will seek to test the viability and scalability of digital initiatives before they are rolled out in other rural locations.</p></reply>

The scheme was closed to new entrants from 1 January 2014. </p>  <p>  It had been intended to close the scheme from 31 December 2017.  However, due to the exceptional difficulties and pressures experienced in the housing sector, arrangements have been put in place to continue support to existing MIS beneficiaries by providing alternative financial support under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  All cases are subject to ongoing review to ensure there is a requirement to continue this financial support together with on going engagement with their lenders to explore sustainable solutions.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped approximately 5,746 such borrowers.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,400 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, a further initiative was announced by Government, known as Abhaile.  This scheme further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  This voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  To date, approximately 13,748 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of c. 7,345 principle private residences.  </p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through ongoing engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Generally customers are more likely now than before to have an attachment to the workforce thus ensuring more awareness of their entitlements arising from their PRSI contributions.

The CE programme provides funding for participants aged up to 66 years of age who meet the current eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  A pilot initiative known as the Service Support Stream (SSS) was implemented in January 2016.  This enabled 7% of participants aged 62 years and over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits and to remain on CE up to State pension age, provided the participant continued to meet the eligibility conditions and the number of places on the scheme was not exceeded.  The total number of places allocated nationally to the SSS for the 12 month period of 2016 was 1,600 places, which represented 7% of the total number of active CE places.  To date, all places have not been utilised.</p>  <p>  A commitment given by Government to review the SSS is now completed.  Overall the scheme for over 62&rsquo;s has been positively received by Sponsors, Community Groups who benefit from the service of CE and the participants who have availed of the pilot scheme.  My Department has examined the recommendations, which includes re-visiting the number of places available to the SSS.  I have recently permitted persons on reaching age 62 to apply for one of these places rather than completing a waiting period, in some cases up to 12 months following the break in their previous CE participation.

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. </p>  <p>  The issue of CE Supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are taking the lead on this matter.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance means test is linked to the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory).

I am satisfied that the public consultation processes with regards to pensions reform are being conducted with due regard to the guidelines and principles.</p>  <p>  My Department fully complied with the consultation principles set out below:</p>  <p>  The first of principle is that consultation with the public must be genuine, meaningful, timely, balanced and with the ultimate objective of leading to better outcomes and greater understanding by all involved of the benefits and consequences of proceeding with particular policy or legislation proposals.  Consultation should aim to achieve real engagement and &lsquo;real listening&rsquo; rather than being a pro-forma exercise for bureaucratic purposes.  A genuine consultation process ensures that the real-world impact of policy options is considered. </p>  <p>  The second principle is that consultation should be targeted at and easily accessible to those with a clear interest in the policy in question.  There is no &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to consultation. The size, type and scope of the consultative process depends on the proposed policy, the type and scale of the potential impacts of the proposal or decision being taken, the number of people or groups affected by them, and where relevant particular requirements of the child and young people and those who may be marginalised or vulnerable. </p>  <p>  The third principle is that Government departments and agencies should make systematic efforts to ensure that interested and affected parties have the opportunity to take part in open consultations at all stages of the policy process on significant policy, services and legislative matters: development, implementation, evaluation, and review.</p>  <p>  For example in relation to the reform of the State Pension (Contributory), the policy to introduce the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to pensions calculation was adopted by Government in the National Pensions Framework in 2010, as was the decision to base the entitlements of all new pensioners on this approach from around 2020.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 confirmed the Government&rsquo;s position that the State pension will be reformed and will remain as the fundamental basis of the pension system in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government intends to introduce the TCA to establishing level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards and I launched the public consultation on this proposal in May. My Department invited sectorial interest groups representing pensioners, workers, employers, young people, the unemployed and more.  Members of the media were also invited and the launch was featured extensively throughout the broadcast and written media in the days that followed.  The consultation was hosted on the Department's website and open to everyone to submit responses and submissions.  The consultation sought input on a range of relevant factors which included the amount of contributions needed for a full rate contributory state pension, the amount of credited contribution a person could avail of, and whether there would be a "phase-in period" for the changes.</p>  <p>  The online consultation lasted for over 3 months and we received over 270 responses.  The consultation closed on Monday, the 3rd of September.  An analysis of the views submitted is now being undertaken and feedback will be published on the Department's website.  Following this a review of the consultation process will be carried out which will consider whether the objectives of the consultation have been met, including whether the methods used were appropriate to the objectives and the cost-effectiveness of the consultation process.  It will also identify any lessons learned to inform future consultation processes.     </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The online consultation lasted for over 3 months and we received nearly 300 responses from individuals and organisations.</p>  <p>  The consultation questionnaire was accompanied by a document setting out the context of the consultation.  In Appendix 1 of this document  there is a table setting out the illustrative entitlements under different state contributory pension approaches - the yearly average approach, the National Pensions Framework approach and the TCA2012 approach. It did not include a model for TCA2020 as that model has not yet been decided.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in stating that two of the figures given under the TCA2012 approach in the hypothetical cases are incorrect.  I am advised that this inaccuracy was a result of an error in a formula that was used to calculate the outcomes.  I apologise for this.  I understand that this matter came to light very shortly before the public consultation closed, when a member of the public who had spotted it called an official in my Department. </p>  <p>  I do not believe that this has resulted in those who answered the consultation being misled about the provision for credits in the TCA2012 model.  In the main body of the document, the chapter &ldquo;Models of TCA&rdquo; highlights the primary policy levers within a TCA framework, and the second one listed said &ldquo;The amount of ordinary credited contributions that could be used (10 years in NPF and TCA2012)".   People reading the document would therefore be aware that this limit would apply, and how it would impact upon entitlements.  The table in the appendix was added for illustrative purposes only.  It was also made clear that the TCA2012 model was not being proposed for TCA2020, and it warned that amounts in the table may depend upon a number of factors.     I do not propose to delay either the introduction of the TCA2012 model, or the progress towards TCA2020, on the grounds set out by the Deputy.  Both of these reforms will be introduced via legislation, and the policy choices about the balance between paid contributions, credited contributions and periods caring in the home in calculating entitlements will, I believe be broadly debated by members of the Oireachtas.  An amended copy of the table, with outcomes under the final TCA2020 model will be made available in due course, and I can assure the Deputy that there will be no error in that version.</p>  <p>  Regarding the contributory pension outcomes under TCA2012, it is true that a person who has spent most of their working age life in receipt of Jobseekers payments, and only 15 years paying into the Social Insurance Fund (as in these hypothetical examples cited by the Deputy), would have a significantly lower contributory pension entitlement than someone who had paid into the Social Insurance Fund for 40 or more years.  In most countries, that is how contributory pensions work.  However, in most cases, a person in Ireland who received jobseekers payments for most of their adult lives would be entitled, upon reaching State pension age, to a State pension (non-contributory), at 95% the maximum rate of a contributory pension.  Consequently the amounts cited by the Deputy as being lost by these pensioners would not arise, except in a very small minority of cases, where a person paid very little into the Social Insurance system, was unemployed for most of his/her life, had no homecaring periods, and yet retired with very significant additional means which made them better off than most pensioners.  I think most people would agree that this is very uncommon, and there is not a strong case for such pensioners to be cross-subsidised by others, most of whom have less means, and who have contributed more into the Social Insurance Fund over the years.</p>  <p>  The TCA2020 consultation process is now complete, and officials in my Department are analysing the inputs made by those who participated.  A summary of these will be published on my Department's website in due course when this work is complete.  I am told that a number of submissions stressed the importance of credited contributions, among other matters (notably the total number of contributions required, and the possibility of transitional measures for those who reach pension age soon after 2020), and I will consider the points made in the context of finalising the design for Government's consideration. </p>  <p>  Following this, a review of the consultation process itself will be carried out which will consider whether the objectives of the consultation have been met, including whether the methods used were appropriate to the objectives and the cost-effectiveness of the consultation process.  It will also identify any lessons learned to inform future consultation processes.     </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-25a.1238.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092500088#WRFF01800"><p>The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020. The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person. </p>  <p>  The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines their final pension outcome. In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a full-time caring role. </p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes who are currently assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). A person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of the new HomeCaring periods, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme. Up to 10 years of other credits, for example, awarded when on Jobseekers or Illness Benefit, may also be used, subject to the total of such credits and HomeCaring periods not exceeding 20 years.</p>  <p>  So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits (before or after 1994), over a 50 year period and qualify for a maximum rate pension, despite additional gaps of up to 10 years.  Those with fewer contributions will have a pro-rata entitlement. For example, someone with 18 years PRSI contributions and 18 years homecaring may qualify for a 90% contributory pension.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has pointed out, the National Pensions Framework proposals would have treated homemaking credits and ordinary credits with a standard approach.  However, while it is true they would be counted in the same manner, the conditions of their awarding significantly differed.  Under the Framework, homemaking credits would only have had effect from 1994, with both types of credits being limited to 10 years, and outcomes for women under this model would have been significantly worse than those for men.  It was decided, therefore, that there should be a rebalancing of the proposed TCA formula, with up to 20 years homemaking periods being recognised under TCA2012, for periods both before and after 1994.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Among the key commitments contained in this plan is to develop, by 2022, a new &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment&rsquo; (AE) supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage. </p>  <p>  AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the wellbeing, financial security and independence of future retirees. </p>  <p>  Last month, the Government published a &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal for an AE supplementary retirement savings system and commenced a public consultation process on the design and operational structure of the AE system.  The &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; proposal is a high level draft proposal designed to prompt and generate discussion and improve ideas.  It should not, in any way, be construed as Government&rsquo;s confirmation of what form AE will ultimately take. </p>  <p>  The goal of publishing the &lsquo;Strawman&rsquo; is to help interested parties conceptualise plausible approaches to AE and to facilitate a focused policy debate around key design issues, such as administrative arrangements and organisational approach, target membership, minimum contribution rates and State financial incentives. </p>  <p>  The feedback received during the consultation process will be used to inform future Government decisions and assist in determining a preferred operational structure and design parameters for AE.  To this end, as the 'Roadmap for Pensions Reform' makes clear, further detailed evidence building is required to identify the potential costs attached to any options considered.  Accordingly, it is not possible at this juncture to estimate such costs.  These costs should become more apparent once this work is complete and preferred options are being fully advanced.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Additional social housing supply that becomes available through the activities of the LDA will be subject to the existing social housing allocation systems currently operated by local authorities. </p>  <p>It should be noted that Part V is just one of a range of mechanisms through which a significantly increased level of social housing is being delivered.  Overall, over the course of 2016/17, Rebuilding Ireland has supported the delivery of over 12,700 built, bought or long-term leased social housing homes, in addition to a further 32,000 flexible housing solutions delivered under the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Schemes.  In total, almost 45,000 individuals and families have had their housing needs met over a 2-year period.</p>  <p>  The scale of this delivery has been such that housing waiting lists are falling markedly.  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority are provided in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), which has been carried out on an annual basis since 2016.  Although the full SSHA 2018 report has not yet been published, the number of qualified households recorded on local authority lists shows a drop from 85,799 in 2017 to 71,858 in 2018, a reduction of over 16% in one year alone.</p>  <p>  As regards land acquisition and planning and zoning functions in general, legislation being brought forward later this Autumn for publication in early 2019 will set out the general statutory framework within which the LDA will be expected to operate, including interactions with local authorities and the planning process.  However, I have no plans to require that local authorities that may need to acquire building land for social housing purposes would be obliged to do so solely via the LDA.  Nonetheless, there will clearly be opportunities for both local authorities and the LDA to work together in implementing Government policy in relation to the planning, housing and sustainable urban development policies contained in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework in particular. </p>  <p>  Finally, the zoning of land for development purposes is a reserved function of the elected members, which is distinct from the general land and property acquisition functions of local authorities and commercial state bodies, including the Land Development Agency.</p></reply>

In homes funded under the Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme tenants pay a rent to be determined by the AHB, subject to a minimum set out by my Department. In AHB homes funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme, tenants pay an economic or reasonable rent (such tenants may sometimes avail of Rent Supplement from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection).</p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 enables the Minister to introduce a national differential rents framework which will harmonise local authority rents, including income disregards.  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework, and this work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities.  The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.  It is expected that the review will be completed shortly. It is intended that the meaning of assessable income, and income disregards, will be standardised across the country in the proposed national framework.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland is modelled on blended delivery across the main programmes of build, acquisition and leasing.</p>  <p>  While it is recognised that the pace of delivery, particularly under build activity, may vary from local authority to local authority, the range of delivery options available, combined with the relevant support structures, provide the necessary resources for local authorities.  All stakeholders are expected to be fully mobilised towards meeting the targets for 2018, and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  My Department's focus, and that of all delivery agents, will remain on implementation and delivery to ensure that the range of objectives and targets set are achieved.  A wide range of delivery mechanisms and a funding commitment of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland have been put in place to support the achievement of these targets.  </p>  <p>  Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing units through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes.</p>  <p>  The ambition is for 33,500 of these units to be delivered through build programmes including Part V and Voids; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 units to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives.</p>  <p>  The Voids Programme, introduced in 2014 by my Department, provides additional support to local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting.  The maximum funding provided for each unit under this programme is &euro;30,000.  In addition, the Derelicts Programme provides funding to remediate more seriously derelict social houses.  There is also another smaller 2 into 1 programme, which focuses on converting vacant old bedsit type accommodation into one bedroom units.  Together, under these three programmes, exchequer funding is provided to support local authorities in remediating vacant units.  The exchequer funding provided by the Department is additional to the support that local authorities provide themselves towards such work.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland target for Department funded Voids across the period 2016-2021 is 3,459.  By end 2017 some 4,065 voids had been delivered under the programme, in addition to local authority self funded voids and re-lets, demonstrating significant activity across all local authority areas.</p>  <p>  Management of stock at local level, re-letting programmes and timeframes are all operational matters for each local authority to co-ordinate and execute.  In creating more visibility around targets and delivery against targets, it is my expectation that performance in the delivery of social housing homes at local authority level can be tracked and overseen effectively, particularly by the elected members.</p></reply>

The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended).  The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. </p><p>Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.  It is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis.</p><p>My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf.  There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord.  Local Authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p><p>At the end of Q2 2018, 21.3% of the total number of households being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility (excluding those households accommodated through the homeless HAP arrangements in Dublin).  In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being used was 15.7%<b></b>above rent limits provided.  In the Meath County Council area, at the end of Q2 2018, 46.6% of households had benefitted from additional discretion with the average rate being 14.4% above the relevant rent limits.  </p><p>The data available to my Department indicates that the current rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs.  </p><p>Increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support.</p><p>My Department closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into consideration other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) rent data published on a quarterly basis.  I am satisfied that the maximum rent limits, together with the additional flexibility available to local authorities, are generally sufficient to support the effective operation of the HAP scheme.  However, I will continue to keep the matter under review.</p></reply>

Irish Water has entered into service level agreements (SLAs) with each local authority for the provision of water services.  Staff members working under these arrangements remain local authority employees while continuing to perform key water services functions with local authorities acting as agents of Irish Water.  Staffing arrangements are an operational matter for Irish Water and local authorities within the context of the SLA arrangements currently in place.</p><p>In January 2018, I requested that a process of engagement be undertaken involving Ervia / Irish Water, the County and City Management Association and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to address proposals for a transformation process leading towards Irish Water integrating its operations to become the single public water services authority.  This followed from a process of consideration by Ervia where it examined the options to meet its regulatory and business plan targets and concluded that the public water system would benefit from greater integration of operations into a single utility.  Following this consideration, my Department was informed that the Ervia Board had decided in principle not to renew the SLAs with local authorities beyond 2025 when they are due to expire, and that it would work with local authorities and unions to move to the integrated model within the life of the current Business Plan which runs to 2021.  The Government noted this position in September 2017.</p><p>I have met will all of the parties involved and requested that they would participate in dialogue with each other.  This is on the understanding that the current SLAs between Irish Water and local authorities will remain in place until an alternative is agreed.  It is also on the understanding that no compulsory redundancies would arise as an outcome from the transformation process.  Furthermore, the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provides a mechanism for dealing with the transfer of staff in situations where Service Level Agreements come to an end.  This provides for the protection of terms and conditions and superannuation benefits of staff in such circumstances. </p><p>In May 2018 I asked the Director General of the Workplace Relations Commission to undertake an exercise with the parties and to report to me on the key issues of concern arising.  I received this report on 19 September 2018.  A copy of the report is available on the website of the WRC at the following .</p><p>I will now reflect on the Report and consider the next steps to be taken, taking account of the fact that water services are essential to the daily lives of our citizens and to our economy and the consequent need to ensure that the best and most appropriate arrangements possible are in place for the delivery of these vital services.</p></reply>

We are working with all Dublin local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council (DLRCC), to see their sites brought forward as quickly as possible, with the optimum tenure mix and ensuring the greatest value for money for the taxpayer.  It is, of course, in the first instance, a matter for the local authority and its elected members to agree the optimal approach to development and financing.</p>  <p>  Shanganagh Castle is an excellent site, close to amenities and public transport and it is very positive that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Council Members have come together, on a cross-party basis, with a view to achieving the optimal housing outcome for this site which can deliver over 500 new homes on a mixed-tenure basis.</p>  <p>  In terms of affordable housing for purchase, it can be pursued in accordance with the provisions of Part V of the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009, which are now commenced.  Affordable housing for rental can be pursued under the cost rental option being piloted on two sites in DLRCC and Dublin City Council.  Significant modelling of these approaches have been carried out by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), working with local authorities and my Department.  In addition, my Department has engaged extensively with the European Investment Bank (EIB) with regard to exploring financing options and also leveraging the Bank's vast experience and knowledge in developing and supporting public housing projects in other Member States.  Local authorities have also engaged directly with the EIB for the same purpose.</p>  <p>  I understand that DLRCC is currently working with the NDFA to financially model and compare the optimal development approaches for the Shanganagh Castle site.  I look forward to receipt of a report from the Council, once this work has been finalised.  For my part, I have made it clear that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of this mixed-tenure development. </p>  <p>  To further support the delivery of affordable housing on such local authority sites, additional funding is being provided for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided over the next four years to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  At this point, applications for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund have been received in my Department and are currently being assessed.  While the Shanganagh site was not included by DLRCC at this time, it may feature in a submission under a future call for proposals, once the infrastructural master-plan is available.</p>  <p>  Finally, Woodbrook-Shanganagh is also a designated &lsquo;major urban housing development site&rsquo;.  In recognition of this, I am keen to support its development and have committed funding of just over &euro;4m under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to build public infrastructure which will open up the site for early development. </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to work with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the development of this mixed-tenure housing project at Shanganagh Castle, to help ensure the optimal delivery outcome.</p></reply>

The Act was amended in 2003 by the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003, primarily to strengthen the powers of fire authorities to prosecute summary offences and to update provisions in relation to penalties and service of notices.</p><p>The Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 are generally considered fit for purpose.  However, the Report of the Fire Safety Task Force, established in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy and overseen by my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, makes a number of recommendations for enhancing the current fire safety system.</p><p>The statutory responsibilities of the &ldquo;person having control&rdquo; of premises, as set out in section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981, emerged as a key area of focus for the Task Force and it proposes a number of amendments to the current regulatory system in order to enhance and ensure fire safety in certain categories of buildings, in particular in certain forms of residential/sleeping accommodation identified as a priority area for fire safety efforts.  The legislative amendments proposed by the Task Force seek to clarify and simplify the statutory obligations imposed on the &lsquo;person having control&rsquo; as well as introducing a number of new reporting mechanisms through which the fire safety arrangements in place in premises and sleeping accommodation are brought to the attention of the public.  To ensure that &ldquo;persons having control&rdquo; of premises take action to fulfil their statutory obligations, the Task Force recommends also that a revised focus on enforcement be put in place in parallel to eliminate any disregard for fire safety considerations.</p><p>I have accepted the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations and have requested the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to carry through the recommendations of the report within my direct ambit and to oversee and report on the implementation of other recommendations. </p><p>Copies of both the Report and the Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>Fire Safety Task Force Report:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations:</p><p><i>. </i></p></reply>

The provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  Key to reducing the numbers of families in emergency accommodation is increasing the supply of social housing. Rebuilding Ireland targets the delivery of an additional 50,000 social homes.  However, more immediately, my Department is working closely with the local authorities on the delivery of family hubs to provide more appropriate emergency accommodation for families.  Providing accommodation in family hubs allows for the provision of better supports to families experiencing homelessness.  In particular, while residing in a hub, families are supported by the local authorities and the operators of the hubs to exit to an independent tenancy.</p>  <p>  A record total of 4,729 adults, along with their associated dependents, exited homelessness into an independent tenancy during 2017. My Department is working closely with the local authorities to increase further the numbers of exits. Earlier this year, my Department made the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service available to each of the 31 local authorities.  This is a targeted service to support families and individuals experiencing homelessness in securing a HAP-supported tenancy in the private rented sector. </p>  <p>   The welfare of families and children is an absolute priority for my Department and I work closely with the Minister of Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that robust child protection measures, inspection arrangements and health supports are in place in emergency accommodation for families.</p></reply>

My Department does not directly collect information on the number of loan applications received by each local authority.</p><p>However, as is currently the case, my Department will continue to publish information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.  Information up to Q4 2017 is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/statistics/house-prices-loans-and-profile-borrowers/local-authority-loan-activity, and this information will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.</p><p>In addition, the Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses loan applications that are made to the local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities as to whether loans should be offered to applicants.  I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures on the numbers of applications that it has assessed and the most recent figures, as at the end of August, indicate that the Agency had received a total of 2,628 applications  for assessment from local authorities. The table below provides information on the geographical distribution of applications received centrally by them for assessment since the scheme began:</p><p><table><tr><th>Region </th><th>Feb - Apr</th><th>May</th><th>Jun</th><th>Jul</th><th>Aug</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Cork, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow</td><td>359</td><td>182</td><td>193</td><td>131</td><td>126</td><td>991</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>407</td><td>214</td><td>161</td><td>115</td><td>91</td><td>988</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>230</td><td>107</td><td>110</td><td>111</td><td>91</td><td>649</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>996</td><td>503</td><td>464</td><td>357</td><td>308</td><td>2,628</td></tr></table></p><p>Of the 2,628 applications received, 2,074 were deemed to be valid.

Instead, local authorities harness the capacity of a variety of funding schemes in addition to utilising their own revenue to deliver Part V homes. Where the outcome of the Part V negotiation is for the local authority to purchase on-site or off-site homes from the developer, then one option for them is to recoup the costs through the main Social Housing Capital Investment Programme (SHCIP). Another option is to allocate the homes for delivery by an AHB who may also be working with the developer to deliver additional homes in the same development; in this scenario, the AHB may apply for Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) funding (where loan funding for up to 30% of the capital cost is provided, with the AHB borrowing the balance) on the overall scheme, with the Part V homes incorporated into overall scheme costs. Finally, where the negotiation between the local authority and the developer results in a long- term lease arrangement, then there is no capital funding requirement and the homes are incorporated into the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) leasing scheme. 305 Part V units delivered in 2017 were delivered by AHBs under either the CALF scheme or SHCEP. </p><p>A Payment and Availability Agreement (P&amp;amp;A agreement) is the contract which forms the basis of the lease arrangement between the local authority and the AHB for the purposes of leasing a housing unit, regardless of how the housing unit is sourced. Agreements are generally for between 20 and 30 years. The basic principles behind the operation of the agreement are that the local authority identifies and nominates the tenants to be housed in these properties, and the local authority decides the rent to be paid by the tenant to the AHB in accordance with its Differential Rent Scheme. The local authority makes payments to the AHB on a regular basis which is recouped to the local authority by my Department. These payments are generally around 92% of market rent with rent reviews indexed to CPI every three or four years.</p><p>The attached document sets out the total Part V output by delivery stream with

The closing date for receipt of submissions was 31 August. &euro;75 million of Exchequer funding is being provided under the SSF to provide enabling infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of affordable homes on local authority and Housing Agency sites, in or near centres where increasing house prices and rents have created a significant affordability gap for first-time buyers and for those wishing to rent.</p><p>The call for funding is being targeted initially at eleven local authorities, where it has been identified that there is a more pressing need for affordable housing. The local authorities initially targeted are the four Dublin local authorities; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Louth, and Galway City; Cork City and County Councils.</p><p>Funding will be capped at &euro;30,000 Exchequer contribution per affordable home to be delivered. When combined with the local authority contribution of at least 25% of the cost of the infrastructure bid, this will generally bring the per-unit grant to a &euro;40,000 maximum.  On this basis, there is scope to provide grant funding to at least 2,500 affordable homes facilitated under the &euro;100m Fund.</p><p>There is &euro;20m public funding available this year and &euro;26.7m in 2019. Nine local authorities have submitted a total of fifteen proposals, which are currently being assessed in my Department, with the aim of working toward completing the assessments and awarding funding next month.

Confirmation of the appointment alone is not sufficient.</p><p>Doctor / Dentist / Hospital Appointments </p><p>-  If a member of staff is absent due to attending a doctor/dental/hospital appointment for either a full day or a half-day (a.m. or p.m.) the absence in question should be recorded as sick absence.</p><p>-  If however the staff member has attended for work prior to/after the appointment they can claim time for a sick absence on the following basis:</p><p>Morning appointments </p><p>-  If staff attending a health appointment in the morning do not have any clocking during the morning (up to 12.30pm) &ndash; this must be claimed as a half day's sick leave.</p><p>-  However, core time credit up to 12.30pm will be given provided a reasonable (i.e. approx 1 hour) period of morning attendance has been recorded prior to or after the absence in question.  An officer must also be clocked in by 1.30pm in order to reclaim the credit.</p><p>Afternoon Appointments </p><p>-  If staff attending a health appointment in the afternoon do not have any clocking during the afternoon (up to 5.00pm) &ndash; this also must be claimed as a half day's sick leave.</p><p>-  However, core time credit until 4.00pm will be given provided a reasonable (i.e. approx 1 hour) period of afternoon attendance has been recorded prior to or after the absence in question.  An officer must also be clocked in until at least 1.15pm in order to reclaim the credit.</p><p>All Day Appointment </p><p>- If staff do not attend work at all during the day of a health appointment then this must be classed as one full day sick leave and the manager must report it to PeoplePoint via this portal.</p><p>The 'protective year' was applied so that someone who had returned to work following Critical Illness Pay (CIP) could avail of remaining CIP leave for subsequent non-critical illnesses/injuries.</p><p>Within the 12 month period from the date of return to work after a civil servant suffers with a critical illness/injury they can continue to access the extended sick pay limits normally given for critical illness/injury only (i.e. 365 days), even where they are not critically ill, provided that:</p><p>-  the civil servant has previously been absent because of a critical illness/injury; and</p><p>-  the civil servant suffers from a non-critical illness/injury during the 12 months following the first day of the return to work following a critical illness/injury absence.</p><p>While I have outlined the general provisions for health appointments, it is the individual's circumstances, including their sick leave record and the nature of the illness, that determines their access to sick leave and Temporary Rehabilitation Remuneration (TRR).  I am satisfied that the scheme ensures that all staff who have serious illness are protected.</p></reply>
