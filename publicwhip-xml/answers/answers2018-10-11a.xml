This is a key Government Brexit response for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy outlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and its potential for future growth. Brexit is obviously a significant challenge given our unique exposure to the UK market. Farmers, the seafood sector and food businesses will need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to continue the growth in Irish agri-food exports, which reached a record &euro;13.6 billion in 2017. The Scheme forms an important part the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response alongside the &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, the provision of additional resources to the agri-food and enterprise State Agencies and an intensification of Minister-led trade missions to access and develop new markets.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Along with the likes of Milk Flex, this Scheme will form part of a comprehensive investment package for farmers. I am also delighted to be able to include the seafood sector in the Scheme</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing 40% of the funding so an overall agri-food package of &euro;120 million will be available. However, unlike previous Schemes, this can be reviewed and adjusted according to demand.</p>  <p>  Further details will be provided in the coming months.  The Scheme is expected to be in place in early 2019 and will run for three years from its launch date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-11a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101100050#WRA00800"><p>My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the relevant research and the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to secure in the Budget this week an allocation of &euro;20 million in 2019 for a new pilot scheme for suckler farmers, specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the liveweight of the calf at weaning as a percentage of the cow's liveweight. This data will be used to target improvements on a herd basis by giving the farmer detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals. The data collected will also be a valuable addition to Ireland's already impressive database on cattle genomics. Details of the scheme will be announced in due course.</p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  </p>  <p>  I am conscious that this has been a difficult year for the sector in terms of weather and the range of challenges associated with it. At the recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable on 3 October, I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency. I urged processors to engage positively with their farmer suppliers to build the sustainability of the sector as a whole and to ensure a reasonable return for the farmers upon whom the sector relies for its development.  It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be secured if we are to build a sector for the future.</p>  <p>  The Beef Roundtable also included discussions on the potential for producer organisations and the development of new technologies as ways of adding value along the whole supply chain, all tools to build resilience in the sector. Producer Organisations would allow farmers to engage collectively with processors, with the aim of strengthening farmers' bargaining power. Additionally, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct a detailed examination of market dynamics, with the cooperation of the industry, taking into account sales of particular cuts into particular segments of the market in order to improve price transparency.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths the agri-food sector has is our shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that this new provision announced in this week's Budget and the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. According to National Farm Survey already suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.</p></reply>

This report provides the sport with a road map for its potential development and I will be supporting the recommendations within my Department's remit from the outset. </p>  <p>  In March 2018 my Department agreed the sum of &euro;63,714 to fund the preparation and development of a Five Year Strategic Plan for the Irish Harness Racing Association and the sector. A draft of this report was recently received and my officials are in discussion with the Irish Harness Racing Association regarding its contents.</p>  <p>  I would like to highlight that in addition to the funding provided for the Indecon Review and the development of a Five Year Strategic Plan, I have already committed to continuing and expanding the pilot integration programme, which will be funded by my Department.</p>  <p>- With a view to raising the awareness of the critical importance of good horse welfare amongst road racing sulky participants and the owners and keepers of trotting horses, my Department awarded a tender to carry out an education programme Horse Welfare course for Road-Racing Sulky Drivers and owners. The first course was run in the Dublin region in May 2018. A second course is currently under way in Tipperary. A third course began at the end of September in Cork and has a high level of engagement with participants in the north of the county. The demand for a fourth course is currently being assessed in other areas.</p>  <p>- In 2017 grants totalling &euro;40,020.00 were paid to the Irish Harness Racing Association under the Equine Technical Support Scheme. In 2018, &euro;24,823.00 in grants were also approved under this Scheme.</p>  <p>- Support valued in excess of &euro;25,000 for 'Road Racing Education Programme' were issued in 2017.</p>  <p>  Similarly in 2016, the Irish Harness Racing Association received grants totalling &euro;21,704.00 under the Equine Infrastructure grant scheme, with a view to supporting this sector in a targeted way.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-11a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101100050#WRA01300"><p>The new legislative proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy 2021 - 2027 were launched on Friday 1 June 2018 by Commissioner Hogan.  The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments.  There will be some additional discretion for Member States in configuring the measures available, within parameters laid down in the draft proposals.   The new proposals must commit to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in pillar I. </p>  <p>  These are complex proposals.  We are currently in the process of what are intensive and challenging negotiations.  I am working with the Commission and other Member States to shape these proposals into an effective new CAP.  My Department is continuing to analyse the proposals and their potential implications for the Irish agrifood sector.  </p>  <p>  The new proposals allow for subsidiarity for Member States but with an overall commitment by the European Commission to protect the common policy and avoid distorting the single market.  </p>  <p>  I have already indicated that I am open to consider some level of capping.  Ireland has already applied the maximum level of degressivity allowable under the current regulations for payments over &euro;150,000. The new proposals include a number of measures designed to move further in this direction, including an overall mandatory cap of &euro;100,000; degressivity for payments above &euro;60,000; a complementary redistributive income support; and, the convergence of payments towards a minimum of 75% of the average payment per hectare nationally. However these are currently draft proposals only.  My Department is at present examining these proposals carefully to assess their potential impact on applicants, and to ensure that any such mechanisms can be implemented without undue complexity.</p>  <p>  The CAP draft legislative proposals come against the background of recent proposals for the next Multi-annual Financial Framework 2021-2027.  The Multiannual Financial Framework sets the budgetary ceilings for the next seven years across a range of headings, including CAP. It is anticipated that the next MFF will be finalised before the European elections in May 2019. Until the final budget for CAP Post 2020 is agreed, along with the draft CAP proposals it is not possible to give an accurate position on the details of the future Agri Schemes.   I remain focused on this crucial issue of the overall level of the budget and am working closely with my European colleagues on this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-11a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101100050#WRA01500"><p>I am grateful to have the opportunity to inform the House of the actions I have undertaken already to seek to ensure sufficient supplies of Fodder for the coming Winter and Spring 2019. </p>  <p>  A survey of Fodder supplies in September, conducted at my request, indicated that the potential national fodder deficit has reduced from 18% earlier this Summer to 11% at that time. Further reductions are anticipated since this survey was conducted as farmers continue to harvest fodder.</p>  <p>  My priority has been to support the conservation of as much fodder for the coming Winter as possible from our own resources, and to supplement this with necessary imports as required. To achieve this I introduced a number of targeted measures:</p>  <p>  I introduced a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure. </p>  <p>  I also announced a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. While the measure will operate through the Co-operatives and registered importers, the actual beneficiaries will be farmers who need supplies of fodder. </p>  <p>  Additionally, I also secured agreement from Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments which will be increased to 70% and 85% respectively, resulting in &euro;260 million in additional cash flow for farmers at a vital time of the year. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year and in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was announced and has allowed farmers capitalise on Autumn grass growth for fodder production. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the range of measures introduced by me to date, taken together and targeted at producing as much fodder as possible from our own land, is the most effective response to ensuring adequate supplies ahead of the coming Winter. However I can assure you that I will continue to closely monitor and engage on this significant challenge during the coming period.</p></reply>

I am pleased to see that this engagement and the delivery of last year&rsquo;s Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme has acted as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new products for the sector:</p><p>- A recently announced initiative by one of the main banks mirrors the Scheme in offering a discounted interest rate with extended and flexible repayment terms.</p><p>- All three main banks have dedicated offerings in response to the current situation.</p><p>- Co-ops have introduced recent initiatives on credit facilities for their suppliers.</p><p>A Spending Review of the Agriculture Cash Flow Loan Scheme, published with the Budget, concluded that this was the main impact of the Scheme.</p><p>In the context of these new and improved supports in this area, the focus of the Government has been to address market gaps, the most critical of which has been identified as unsecured longer-term investment finance.

We have to acknowledge that input costs at farm level will be unexpectedly high this year as a result of fodder shortages. </p>  <p>  At the recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable on 3rd October I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency. I urged processors to engage positively with their farmer suppliers to build the sustainability of the sector as a whole and to ensure a reasonable return for the farmers upon whom the sector relies for its development.  It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be improved if the industry is to build a sector for the future.</p>  <p>  The Beef Roundtable also included discussions on the potential for producer organisations and the development of new technologies as ways of adding value along the whole supply chain though increased engagement in the bioeconomy.  These discussions were aimed at highlighting available tools to build resilience in the sector. </p>  <p>  I noted that previously at the Beef RoundTable in 2015, a commitment was made to legislate for the recognition of Producer Organisations (POs) in the beef sector.  This initiative was supported by all sectoral stakeholders and in February of 2016 a Statutory Instrument was signed into law to give a legal basis for my Department to maintain a register of recognised POs in the beef sector.  The recognition of POs will encourage primary beef producers to form Producer Organisations and allow farmers to engage collectively with processors.  The ultimate aim is to ensure the viable development of production by strengthening farmers' bargaining power with downstream operators.</p>  <p>   At the Roundtable on 3 October, I also  asked Bord Bia to conduct a detailed examination of market dynamics, with the cooperation of the industry, taking into account sales of particular cuts into particular segments of the market in order to improve price transparency.</p>  <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agri-food sector has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  I hope that this positive engagement will continue.</p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the beef sector, I was pleased to secure in the recent Budget, &euro;20 million for a new pilot scheme targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. The pilot will build on existing work in this area and inform the development of future policy direction. </p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agri-food sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.</p></reply>

To illustrate, during the height of a sugar beet industry in Ireland growers were receiving payment approaching &euro;50/tonne whereas in 2018, growers in the UK are receiving approximately &pound;22.50/tonne (&euro;25/tonne) for sugar beet with a price drop of 15% quoted for 2019 harvest of &pound;19.07/tonne (&euro;21.36/tonne).</p>  <p>  As part of the reform of the CAP under the Irish Presidency, agreement was secured on the abolition of sugar quotas from 30th September 2017. From that date, investors in the European Union, including Ireland are free to invest in sugar producing capacity if they wish.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, a number of groups expressed an interest in  the redevelopment of the sugar sector, two of whom prepared desktop feasibility studies between 2010 and 2011.  In their findings, both proposals sought to develop a new sugar and bio ethanol production facility with capital costs, estimated at the time, of between &euro;250 and &euro;400 million.</p>  <p>  The current "Programme for a Partnership Government" states that "State Bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans relating to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports".</p>  <p>  Any such business plans  would need to be supported by a sufficiently robust business case, having regard to the price of sugar, to attract the substantial funding required from investors for such a new start-up industry.</p></reply>

That is what Ireland wants from the negotiations, and it is also what the EU wants.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the UK commitment, in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, was extremely important. The aim from an agri-food perspective is to continue with the free movement of agricultural goods and animals on the island of Ireland, while maintaining veterinary regulations and standards. </p>  <p>  Ensuring that the UK gives effect to this commitment is a significant focus of the Irish Government, and we have the full support of our EU partners and of the European Commission Task Force in this regard. I and my Department have been contributing actively to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade- coordinated &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; approach to ensuring such an outcome from the negotiations.</p>  <p>  In relation to the maintenance of veterinary regulations and standards on the island, I want to assure the Deputy that the ongoing, close co-operation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland established under the All island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy is continuing. The working groups established under the strategy,  continue to focus on critical issues such as disease control, animal identification and movement, cross-border communication, data sharing and the development of joint initiatives on animal welfare.  </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agricultural industry through the challenges ahead. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. </p>  <p>  And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the entire UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.</p></reply>

Of course, we remain vigilant in monitoring the market and emerging trends, particularly after the challenges of this season faced by Irish farmers.</p>  <p>  The issue of intervention stocks overhanging the dairy market remains a cause for concern, arising from the significant recourse to this market measure for skimmed milk powder across the EU since September 2015.</p>  <p>  Figures from the European Commission show that there were approximately 245,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in public intervention stocks at the end of September 2018 ,effectively overhanging the EU skimmed milk powder market. This figure represents a substantial reduction of over 145,000 tonnes in the quantity of SMP in public intervention stocks across the EU over the course of this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to the sale of intervention stocks, the Commission has agreed to accept bids as part of recent tender processes, for approximately 43,000 tonnes of  SMP at a price of &euro;123/100kg since August.</p>  <p>  An additional recent development in terms of the strategy adopted for reducing the overhang of SMP stocks in public intervention has been to amend Implementing Regulation 2016/2080 &ldquo;as regards the periods for the submission tenders&rdquo;, which will result in approximately doubled frequency of tenders for sale of product in intervention which provides for &ldquo;two partial invitations to tender per month&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Commission&rsquo;s general approach, my Department and I engaged at Council of Ministers meetings and directly with the Commission on recent measures to prevent further stockpiling of skimmed milk powder into 2019 without due justification, including the Commission's proposal to reduce the fixed-price ceiling to zero which it had previously introduced for 2018.</p>  <p>  This proposal is for 2019 only and it is essential that this should not mark a fundamental or permanent change in the mechanism for intervention for dairy products agreed by Member States in the Council Regulation in 2013.  The intervention mechanism is an essential tool which puts a floor under SMP prices and the importance of its availability to the Commission as a means to deal with extreme price volatility and any other market crisis must be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  I have clearly stated previously, at Council of Ministers meetings and elsewhere, that it is imperative that the Commission remains vigilant in monitoring the market and that it has contingencies in place in the event of market volatility re-emerging in relevant markets, particularly the raw milk, butter and skimmed milk powder markets. However, in common with the vast majority of EU member states where dairy production is of significance, I recognise that the current position of existing stocks cannot be allowed to persist indefinitely.</p>  <p>  Given the Commission's status among the world&rsquo;s biggest players on the skimmed milk powder market, and as such its capacity to affect market sentiment, the Commission should act prudently and responsibly in the disposal of stocks. I am satisfied to date that the Commission has managed those stocks in a prudent manner.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged and will continue to engage with the Commission, with other member states, and with national stakeholders on these important issues.</p></reply>

Voluntary codes of practice have been established by The Hunting Association of Ireland which detail the conduct to be adhered to in respect of the hunting of foxes and the treatment of the animal during the hunt. The Code prohibits the hunting of foxes where the animal is injured and advocates the humane disposal of a fox when captured.  The code also takes into account local concerns and the concerns of the landowner(s) on whose land hunting takes place. </p>  <p>  While I have no plans to ban fox hunting, officials of my Department met with the Hunting Association to review their existing Code and consider whether it needs updating.  </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to promoting good practices that respect the welfare of all animals and my Department devotes considerable resources to protecting animal welfare and in dealing with breaches of animal welfare legislation. Under the Act, on summary conviction, a person can receive a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and, on indictment, &euro;250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 5 years. There are fixed penalty payments for lesser offences. The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.</p></reply>

This was a significant increase on the equivalent 2017 figure of &euro;160m.  In addition, the number of farmers paid in this first tranche increased from 75,000 in 2017 to almost 77,000 this year.  Regular pay runs are continuing to ensure that cases are paid as they become clear, and to date over &euro;194.4m has issued to 80,600 farmers under the  ANC Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am also happy to confirm that the European Commission has agreed to my request  for a higher advance payment of 70% under the 2018 BPS and Greening.  This is an increase on the standard 50% rate allowed for under the EU regulations.  Advance payments under the BPS are  due to commence on 16th October, which is the earliest date possible under EU Regulations.  The 30% balancing payments will then commence at the start of December.</p>  <p>  There will also be an increase to 85% advance payment rates under a number of CAP Pillar II Rural Development schemes.   This increased rate applies to GLAS and the Sheep Welfare Scheme, which will see advance payments commence in November.</p>  <p>  Preparations for payments under year 2 of the Knowledge Transfer Scheme to commence at the end of October 2018 are also underway while payments under the Beef Data and Genomics Programme, along with the Young Farmers Scheme, the Organic Farming Scheme and the Protein Aid scheme will all commence in December.</p>  <p>  In addition, payments continue to issue to farmers on a weekly basis under TAMS II, with an average payment of over &euro;1m per week for the last year.  To date, 5,689 approved applicants under the Scheme have completed their approved works, submitted a payment claim and have been paid. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to  process payments under these schemes as a matter of priority, to ensure that these vital supports are delivered to farmers in the most timely and efficient manner possible.</p></reply>

My continued objective is to ensure that the implications for fisheries are fully taken account of throughout the negotiations for a future EU-UK relationship. </p><p>In recent months, I have continued to have positive, regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Member States whose fisheries are most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.  The results of my engagement with the Barnier Task Force, in close collaboration with the T&aacute;naiste are evident in the agreed EU position on fisheries.</p><p>In the context of the economic relationship, the European Council confirmed its readiness to start work towards a balanced, ambitious and wide-ranging free trade agreement (FTA). On fisheries, it is very welcome that the maintenance of reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources is proposed in the European Council Guidelines. </p><p>The actual agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. This is why a status quo transitional arrangement is so important. Of course, it is in the interest of everyone that a future relationship agreement is concluded as quickly as possible after the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty sooner rather than later.</p><p>It is very welcome that the European Council has proposed that the whole of the EU <i>acquis </i>will apply to the UK during the transition, which means that in the context of a Withdrawal Agreement the status quo will be preserved with the aim of avoiding any gaps or cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and when a future relationship agreement enters into force. </p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that, working together with the T&aacute;naiste and his team and the Barnier Task Force, I will continue to work  to ensure that negotiations on fisheries remain inextricably linked to the overall future relationship negotiations in order to protect our existing access rights and quota entitlements. </p><p>Overall, it is Ireland&rsquo;s view that the EU27&rsquo;s basic position should be to protect EU fishing communities. While all parties would like higher quotas, the way to achieve that is to grow the stocks through sustainable management for the benefit of all.</p></reply>

It is a hugely significant achievement for our industry, as well as an excellent endorsement of our world-class safety standards and product quality. </p>  <p>  Three beef plants were approved by the Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) in April. As part of my Trade Mission to China in May it was confirmed that a further three beef plants had met the required standards for approval. These plants were subsequently formally approved and listed by CNCA in June. This was a great result and reflects the on-going work in this area. </p>  <p>  My Department has spent many years working closely with the Chinese authorities in order to secure this agreement. This work has included inward and outward trade missions, inspection visits, and various bilateral contacts with officials in relevant Chinese Ministries. Throughout the course of this work, my officials have developed a deep understanding of Chinese requirements. This understanding has been essential in devising procedures to satisfy the conditions of China&rsquo;s protocol. </p>  <p>  A new Veterinary health certificate that covers both beef and pigmeat came into effect on 1st June 2018 and the beef trade has commenced with product already having arrived into China by both air freight and shipping. My officials continue to make progress on various technical issues and the focus now is on trying to get additional plants approved and listed by the Chinese authorities.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, the role of the Government is to open up market access and to remove barriers to trade; the industry must then make its own decisions in relation to market priorities, but I hope that Irish beef exports will follow the same success that our dairy and pigmeat sectors have enjoyed in China to date.</p></reply>

ICES provide advice on catch levels for all of the fish stocks of importance to Ireland.  This advice is produced through a collaborative process by scientists from around the world including those from the Marine Institute here in Ireland. </p><p>The advice for mackerel for 2019 was published on the 28th of September last and is a complex and detailed document. It does contain within it a number of caveats about how the advice is arrived at.</p><p>The headline advice is that the catch, by all parties including those who operate outside the 2014 Mackerel Agreement, for 2019 should not exceed 318,403 tonnes. This would equate to a 68% reduction compared to total 2018 catches.  Ireland's quota would reduce by 61% compared to 2018. </p><p>This advice, like all advice, is based on a number of data inputs that are interpreted by the scientists according to standard rules of procedure. Given the importance of this stock to Ireland, I asked the Marine Institute to provide their views. They have advised that while there was a rigorous analytical process conducted by ICES there are some concerns - recognised by ICES themselves - regarding the quality and the relative weighting of some of the data inputs that were utilised.</p><p>In light of this information, Ireland, working in cooperation with a large number of fellow EU Member States, called for an urgent review by ICES of the data inputs.  The other Coastal States supported this position as did ICES themselves.  The latter confirmed earlier this week that an inter benchmark review will take place as soon as possible. </p><p>Mackerel is our single most important fishery and Ireland is the second largest quota holder in the EU.  We rely on a long term sustainable fishery.  That is why we must be absolutely confident in the scientific advice.  If ICES had advised a 60% increase I would be equally calling for a review.</p><p>No decision on a TAC level for 2019 was reached between the Coastal States (EU, Norway, Faeroes Islands, Iceland, Greenland and Russia) and a further round of negotiations is scheduled for the 25<sup>th</sup>and 26<sup>th</sup>of October. In the interim, I will continue to consult with the Marine Institute and BIM as well as relevant Member States, the Commission negotiators and stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry. The TAC setting will involve all the  Coastal States, in particular the other parties to the 2014 Mackerel Agreement, Faeroes and Norway.</p></reply>

With this in mind, I have ensured that my Department has put in place a range of supports for the sheep sector in recent years across a number of schemes.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Pillar 1 supports under the Common Agricultural Policy, sheep farmers continue to benefit from the direct income support available under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS).  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014-2020, also contains a number of support schemes which offer direct financial benefit to Irish sheep farmers.  Sheep farmers continue to benefit from the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme and from GLAS in large numbers, as well as from capital investment support under TAMS.  In Tuesday's Budget I announced an additional &euro;23m for the ANC scheme, bringing the total to &euro;250m in 2019. I expect sheep farmers to be significant beneficiaries of that measure. The RDP also includes specific provision for sheep farmers within the Knowledge Transfer Programme, which has helped to build on the existing knowledge base and skills set in the sector in a way which will help to ensure continued sustainable development in the sector. </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, in December 2016 I announced the new Sheep Welfare Scheme as an amendment to the RDP.  Under this scheme, farmers are required to choose from a menu of actions which aim to improve the overall welfare of their flock. These actions must be completed over a 12 month period, and in return the farmer receives a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe.  </p>  <p>  This important support was introduced for a period of four scheme years, and I am glad to say that over &euro;18.4m has issued on time to sheep farmers in respect of Year 1 of the Scheme.  85% advance payments under year 2 of the scheme are due to commence  in November of this year.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note the strong export performance of the sector last year, which was reflected in the Central Statistics Office (CSO) 2017 trade and livestock statistics. In 2017, just under 63,000t of Irish sheepmeat worth &euro;311 million was exported in comparison to 56,000t worth &euro;277 for the previous year. This represents a significant growth in tonnage of 12.5% and net worth of 12% </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that my Department continues to work to underpin the development of the sheep sector and to encourage young people to enter the sector. A range of supports under CAP Pillar I and the Rural Development Programme schemes, as well as significant agri-taxation incentives, are in place to encourage inter-generational transfer and land mobility, particularly for young trained farmers.</p></reply>

A key component of the Origin Green assessment is the independent farm audit where the farmer receives a feedback report on his or her farm&rsquo;s performance. This allows them to make informed decisions on improving the sustainability of their farms while also improving their efficiency and farm viability.  The knowledge transfer schemes, funded under the Rural Development Programme, are essential in facilitating the transfer of information from research and advisory services to farmer discussion group networks and cover a range of topics related to sustainability and climate mitigation.  </p>  <p>  My Department is supporting a number of other schemes and measures under the Rural Development Programme to help farmers improve their farm&rsquo;s environmental performance.  Measures such as the Agri-Environment scheme, GLAS, includes specific measures to support climate change objectives whilst our Organic farming scheme supports organic farming as an alternative farming system contributing to improving soil quality and mitigation and adaptation to climate change. </p>  <p>  Improving breeding and maintaining the health of livestock is also very important to achieving efficiency and managing emissions.  This is actively supported through our Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP). This Programme ranks the efficiency of beef breeding animals on a star based system, with 5-star being the most efficient.  Building on the success of this Programme I have just announced a new pilot scheme - The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot &ndash; which will be targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows.  Farmers will get detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals allowing them to identify the most productive cows in their herd.  On the Dairy side, the &lsquo;Economic Breeding Index&rsquo; is identifying the most efficient animals for grass based production system.</p>  <p>  In terms of sequestration, or the capturing of carbon, our most significant intervention is the national afforestation programme.  Afforestation and forests also play a key role in replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. We are therefore, investing heavily in the Afforestation Scheme to encourage landowners to establish forests on their land. The Government has recently approved significant improvements in grant and premium rates under the agroforestry and forestry for fibre options.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also investing heavily in research and I have recently announced an additional &euro;5.4 million in research grant awards.  This brings the total grants awarded for collaborative inter-institutional agri-food research under my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Competitive Research Call to over &euro;19 million. This investment in agri-food research will support the sector to innovate in terms of production efficiency, higher value products and environmental sustainability. </p>  <p>  We are continuously looking ahead; increased environmental ambition will be a key element of CAP Post 2020. As we look towards defining the measures and targets under the new CAP regime the recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; is key to informing the type of abatement measures we need to focus on with a view to achieving the 2030 targets.</p></reply>

Total agri-food exports amounted to &euro;13.6 billion in 2017, according to the Central Statistics Office trade statistics, an increase of 74% since 2009. My Department officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible. This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and is in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. Opening new markets involves a wide range of detailed work taking place across a range of levels including political, diplomatic, technical and official levels. This year already, I have led trade missions to the US, Canada and China. I will be leading a delegation to Indonesia and Malaysia very shortly and my colleague, Minister Doyle will  be visiting China.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia&rsquo;s work is critical to the successful growth of our food and drinks exports.</p>  <p>  The development of the Origin Green programme, providing proof of the sector&rsquo;s sustainability credentials, has played an important part.  Bord Bia  also works closely with my Department to prioritise and develop new markets, building on its significant investment in consumer and retail insights. </p>  <p>  As an agency, Bord Bia has played a key role in our Brexit response to date, facilitating conversations at the highest levels with UK retail CEOs, and ensuring that our ongoing commitment to the UK market is fully understood.  We have no intention of stepping back from the UK market. On the contrary, we will redouble our efforts to build on our consumer reputation and strong relationships to maximise growth and supply high quality and innovative products to our neighbouring island. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit Barometer has been used to identify evolving client priorities and concerns and to further inform Bord Bia&rsquo;s Brexit programmes and supports. As a result of the many findings from that exercise, Bord Bia has launched a series of Brexit support programmes focussed on supply chains, customs requirements regarding trade, and currency risk for the industry.</p>  <p>  Significant additional funding has been provided to Bord Bia in various tranches since the Brexit referendum, as a key part of our Brexit response for the food industry. Bord Bia received approval in 2018 to recruit 32 additional staff as part of the wider Brexit response. A recruitment campaign commenced in April 2018 and so far 22 positions have been filled. Recruitment is ongoing for the balance and it is hoped that these additional staff will be in place by end of the year. 13 of these positions are to be based abroad in line with the Government policy of doubling our Global footprint.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that in this week's Budget I secured the allocation of a further &euro;5.35 million to Bord Bia for 2019, bringing its total grant in aid to &euro;46.6 million for 2019.  This compares to a grant in aid of &euro;28.9 million in 2014, an increase of over 60% over five years.</p></reply>

I am hopeful that progress can be made in the short-term on both the Ireland-Northern Ireland back-stop and on the framework for the discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, so that they can be incorporated into a Withdrawal Agreement that will provide for a transition period and a more orderly Brexit in the period up to 2021. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government has introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit. In terms of dealing with Competitiveness issues, my Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget. In Budget 2018 I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses. </p>  <p>  I have followed up these measures with further initiatives announced this week as part of Budget 2019, which contains a &euro;78 million Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs in my Department. This includes &euro;44 million in direct aid to farmers through increased spending on areas of natural constraint, the introduction of a Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot Scheme and additional funding for the horticulture sector. Support for the food industry to the tune of &euro;27 million includes measures aimed at improving competitiveness and innovation, additional funding for Bord Bia and additional funding to progress the National Food Innovation Hub in Teagasc Moorepark. And &euro;7 million has been provided to support Brexit preparedness work within my Department, namely, to meet the staffing and IT costs associated with the additional import control and export certification requirements arising from Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Under Market Diversification, my Department is supporting Bord Bia in its investment in market insight (through its &lsquo;Thinking House&rsquo;) and in market prioritisation initiatives which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. Indeed, I have increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;14.5m since the UK referendum. </p>  <p>  As regards Product Diversification, I am supporting Teagasc in the development of a new National Food Innovation Hub in Fermoy (&euro;8.8 million funding announced by An Taoiseach and myself last October). </p>  <p>  In line with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-coordinated  &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to Brexit, my Department is planning for an orderly Brexit which involves, inter alia, a transition period to the end of December 2020. Key Government decisions in this regard have been made in July and September in relation to staffing and IT resources, and engagement with the relevant ports and airports is ongoing in relation to the infrastructure needed to carry out import controls and customs checks.</p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing in relation to contingency planning for a disorderly Brexit at the end of March 2019. In this regard my Department&rsquo;s focus is on the arrangements that will be necessary in order to fulfil its legal obligations as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements. Similar to the work already undertaken in relation to the central case scenario, my Department will be working closely with other Departments in progressing these arrangements over the coming period.  </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. </p>  <p>  And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the entire UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.</p></reply>

Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.</p>  <p>  Trade missions, of course, play a crucial role in market development, not just in terms of the valuable opportunity that they provide for businesses to make contacts and develop relationships, but also in terms of their usefulness in developing political and official contacts, which are often just as important in facilitating business development and resolving market access issues. For this reason they are an essential component of the suite of measures that I and my Department deploy in our efforts to develop more opportunities for Irish agri-food exporters.</p>  <p>  In the last two years I have led a series of very successful trade missions. In 2017, destinations included the Gulf States, the US, Mexico, Japan and South Korea. In the case of the latter two, this was an ideal opportunity to exploit the benefits to be derived from the EU's recent trade and economic partnership agreements with South Korea and Japan. </p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and my Department is currently making the final arrangements for a further trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  Both of these markets had been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  It is also no coincidence that the destinations that have we recently visited and plan to visit are now some of the countries showing the greatest increase in growth, with the value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America standing at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017. The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017. Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly, to reach &euro;370 million. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

In respect of imports via the postal system, the parcels are presented by An Post to Revenue at the postal depots who then assess the parcels for duty and VAT. An Post pay the amounts assessed to Revenue and recoup this amount from the importer at the time of delivery of the parcels.</p>  <p>  While it is not possible to quantify the overall effect of illegal imports on the market, Revenue carries out risk analysis on importations to identify and monitor the movement of imports using EU standard risk criteria.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it regularly reviews how resources are allocated to various functions having regard to risk and that it considers that it currently has adequate resources to monitor single parcel consignments entering the country.

The first key clarification is that where a school intends to provide religious instruction/faith formation, parents must give consent before admission to the class. This means that withdrawal does not arise because the parent has requested a place in the religious instruction class. The other key clarification is that classes following the NCCA Religious Education syllabus in ETB or Community schools cannot have any element of religious instruction or worship involved or forming any part of the class activity. This clear separation of religious instruction from the NCCA Religious Education syllabus has the effect of ensuring that withdrawal does not arise for students studying the NCCA Religious Education syllabus.  </p>  <p>  This is to ensure that the state&rsquo;s Religious Education syllabus is not taught with any element of religious instruction or worship and that where religious instruction is provided, attendance is confined to those who request to attend.</p>  <p>  This circular has no impact on a parent's right, under section 30 of the Education Act 1998 and the Constitution, to opt out of any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS ceased making payments to IoTs and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.</p>  <p>  The amount charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in IoTs during the academic year. For craft apprenticeships, this cost would typically be one third of the &euro;3,000 Annual Student Contribution paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT.  </p>  <p>  The cost of not charging the Annual Student Contribution is estimated to be &euro;4.2 million in 2018, although there are no plans to abolish the Annual Student Contribution for apprentices.</p>  <p>  SOLAS offers a bursary of &euro;2,666.44 to eligible employers, rather than the apprentices themselves, to encourage them to employ female apprentices in one of the craft apprenticeships. The bursary applies by the relevant Education and Training Board at a rate of &euro;95.23 per week for 28 weeks as a contribution towards the apprentice's salary and other costs.  It is paid in two instalments, the first on completion of phase 1 of an apprenticeship and the second during phase 3 when the apprentice completes the balance of the 28 applicable weeks with their employer.</p></reply>

It is imperative that the legislation around these offences protects the most vulnerable members of society from serious harm and legislation is consistently being reviewed in this area to ensure that our laws offer the best protections for citizens.</p>  <p>  The Government last year enacted the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, a wide-ranging piece of legislation which significantly enhanced laws to combat the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children.  Among the provisions of the 2017 Act are measures to significantly strengthen the existing criminal law in combating child exploitation and, in particular, address the use of modern communication technologies as a tool, which may lead to child sexual exploitation. Specific offences have been provided for to target the recognised steps in what is often a gradual process of grooming a victim. </p>  <p>  Convicted sex offenders are subject to monitoring and supervision in the community through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Probation Service. The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides for the monitoring of convicted sex offenders in the community. Under the 2001 Act a person who has been convicted of a sexual offence must notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their name and address within seven days. The 2001 Act also provides for sex offenders orders where the court can prohibit a convicted sex offender from doing things with a view to protecting the public from harm. I intend to bring to Government shortly a Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill which will strengthen the monitoring of sex offenders in the community, including reducing the notification period from seven to three days.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018, which completed Second Stage debate in this House just last week, will provide for presumptive minimum sentencing for repeat sex offenders. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring an adequate and robust legislative basis to ensure sexual offences are dealt with appropriately and that the public are protected from harm.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. That is why it is important to recognise that the role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.</p><p>The information in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; attached to the Galway Division by Station as of 31 August 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available as provided by the Garda Commissioner, is as set out in the following table.</p><p>Number of Community Garda&iacute; assigned to the Galway Division by Station as of 31 August 2018.<table><tr><th>STATION</th><th>TOTAL</th></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Ballinasloe</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>&Oacute;r&aacute;n M&oacute;r</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Maigh Cuilinn</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Salthill</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loughrea</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tuam </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15</td></tr></table></p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and to deliver improved services and supports. The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. Plans are progressing to further implement the Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways. The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. </p>  <p>  At present, there are nine dementia advisers across the country; eight of these are hired by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland. The HSE has contributed &euro;400,000 in each of 2017 and 2018 towards the service.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September. and recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide. I welcome the positive results of the evaluation and will continue to work to improve service delivery for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

This review is being conducted by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). </p>  <p>  The review includes those women who have developed cervical cancer, whose diagnosis was notified to CervicalCheck or registered with the National Cancer Registry at the beginning of May 2018, and who had been screened by CervicalCheck prior to their diagnosis.</p>  <p>  In light of the sensitivities surrounding this matter, all women whose slides could be reviewed are being contacted to ask for their consent to be included if they wish. Where the woman has, sadly, died, their next of kin are being contacted to seek consent for inclusion. The vast majority of these letters have issued, and the validation process for the remaining next of kin letters is nearing completion.</p>  <p>  It is expected the review will take a number of months to complete.</p></reply>

This is a key Government Brexit response for which I had provided &euro;25 million in funding in 2018.</p>  <p>  The Food Wise 2025 strategy outlines the agri-food sector&rsquo;s unique and special position within the Irish economy and its potential for future growth. Brexit is obviously a significant challenge given our unique exposure to the UK market. Farmers, the seafood sector and food businesses will need to focus on competitiveness and innovation in order to continue the growth in Irish agri-food exports, which reached a record &euro;13.6 billion in 2017. The Scheme forms an important part the Government&rsquo;s Brexit response alongside the &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, the provision of additional resources to the agri-food and enterprise State Agencies and an intensification of Minister-led trade missions to access and develop new markets.</p>  <p>  The Scheme, which will be administered by the SBCI and backed by a European Investment Fund counter-guarantee, will bring previously unavailable 8 to 10 year unsecured investment finance to the Irish market at competitive interest rates. I am working with colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, and Minister Donohoe, to bring up to &euro;300 million of loans to the market.</p>  <p>  This is a long-awaited source of finance for young and new entrant farmers, especially the cohort who do not have high levels of security. It will also serve smaller-scale farmers, who often do not have the leverage to negotiate for more favourable terms with their banking institution. Along with the likes of Milk Flex, this Scheme will form part of a comprehensive investment package for farmers. I am also delighted to be able to include the seafood sector in the Scheme</p>  <p>  Food companies have identified long term investment finance of up to ten years as a critical need which is currently unavailable in Ireland. I am pleased that the Government have been able to deliver this product and its effects will be felt all along the food production chain.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing 40% of the funding so an overall agri-food package of at least &euro;120 million will be available. However, unlike previous Schemes, this can be reviewed and adjusted according to demand.</p>  <p>  Further details will be provided in the coming months.  The Scheme is expected to be in place in early 2019 and will run for three years from its launch date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-11a.396.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018101100055#WRF04600"><p>By way of introduction I would like to point out that in discussing the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, we should bear in mind that this funding forms part of a broader EU budget which is negotiated by Finance Ministers and then agreed by the Heads of State and Government and the European Parliament.  </p>  <p>  The EU proposed CAP budgetary ceilings are a part of these wider proposals on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the European Union for the period 2021-2027.  The European Commission has proposed, as part of the MFF, that funding for the Common Agricultural Policy should not exceed &euro;365 billion for the period 2021-2027. This equates to a cut of around 5% compared to the current provision.  It is hoped that the next MFF will be finalised before the European elections in May 2019.</p>  <p>  The MFF proposal published by the European Commission is an initial position. The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level.  Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government. Ireland has stated clearly that it is important that policies with demonstrable added value continue to be properly supported. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) remains a priority for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  As I have already mentioned, the shape of any new Multi Annual Financial Framework is ultimately a matter for Heads of State and Government.  The agreement of the European Parliament will also be required. Member States have differing expenditure priorities and the loss of UK budgetary contributions will make these negotiations particularly challenging.  Agreement on the budget requires unanimity among Member States. </p>  <p>  I have been working closely with my European colleagues to build a consensus to reverse the cut to the CAP budget and to maintain support to CAP at the current EU 27 level.  In May this year, I, along with my EU Ministerial colleagues from France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland signed a joint Memorandum seeking the retention of the CAP budget at current levels.  The Memorandum was presented at the Agri-Fish Council in Luxembourg on 18 June, and up to 20 other EU Ministers have signalled their support to this proposal now.  At the Agrifish Council on 16 July 2018 France and Germany presented a joint declaration on the CAP proposals including a joint rejection of the cuts proposed. This paper was supported by other Member states including Croatia, Romania, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, Belgium and Ireland. </p>  <p>  Over the coming months detailed negotiations will continue at all levels across the EU as we work together to shape the final outcome. At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that CAP Post 2020, properly funded, will continue to support farm families and the rural economy. </p>  <p>  I can assure the deputy that I will continue to work to develop a broad consensus on the value of a strong, fit for purpose agriculture sector, and work to reverse the cuts proposed in the draft MFF.</p></reply>

The new system will significantly reduce the record-keeping requirements of keepers and will result in a simpler, more effective and robust sheep traceability system.</p>  <p>  Under the new rules, with effect from 1 June 2019, all sheep moving from a holding must be  identified electronically. Generally, all sheep must be identified with a full EID set of tags comprising of one electronic tag in the animal's right ear and a corresponding conventional tag, bearing the same unique animal identification number, in the left ear. Identification with an electronic bolus set will also be permitted. An exception is made for lambs moving directly to slaughter from the holding of birth while aged under 12 months of age. Such lambs must be identified with a minimum of one electronic tag in the right ear although identification with a full set of EID tags/ an electronic bolus set is also permitted.</p>  <p>  The electronic identification of all sheep provides for the establishment of Central Points of recording (CPRs), approved by my Department, to record the individual identification number of each sheep moved to such a destination. </p>  <p>  The approval of CPRs is provided for at Paragraph C2 of the Annex to Council Regulation 21/2004 by way of a derogation from the requirement for a keeper of the holding of departure to record the individual numbers of all sheep moved. The Regulation provides that Member States may authorise the recording of the individual tag numbers of sheep moved within the State at the point of destination, on behalf of the presenting keeper, by holdings approved by the competent authority for this purpose.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2019, approved CPRs will be required to scan the electronic tags of all sheep presented at that location and provide the presenting keeper with a printed list of all sheep presented. This will significantly reduce the administrative burden currently placed on farmers who are required now to manually list these numbers on the dispatch documents accompanying sheep on movement. Under the new system, farmers will simply be required to record the total number of sheep moved to an approved CPR. </p>  <p>  The CPR will provide a printed list of presented tag numbers (LPT) to the keeper within a maximum of 48 hours (but often on the same day). Having checked it for accuracy, the keeper will then associate the LPT with the relevant dispatch document and retain both documents together to complete his/her record keeping requirements.      </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that the enhancement of the sheep traceability system through the extension of electronic identification to all sheep represents an additional tagging cost to keepers.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, I have introduced a once-off  EID tag subsidy scheme, providing keepers with a once-off payment of up to a maximum of &euro;100 based on the number of electronic tags purchased in their first completed order for electronic tags between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019.</p>  <p>  I am similarly aware that the  operation of marts and slaughter plants as CPRs is key to the reduction in the current administrative burden placed on farmers. On that basis, there has been consultation with both marts and slaughter plants on enabling them to become CPRs. </p>  <p>  I have also announced a subvention to marts of 40% of the verified development cost (subject to a maximum of &euro;10,000) of the infrastructure necessary to enable them generate the printout of tag numbers for farmers in respect of sheep supplied. </p>  <p>  I will be closely monitoring progress in the application and approval processes for marts and slaughter plants to operate as CPRs in the coming months, in order to maximise the benefits for the farming community.</p></reply>

That is what Ireland wants from the negotiations, and it is also what the EU wants.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the UK commitment, in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, was extremely important. The aim is to continue with the relatively free movement of agricultural goods/animals on the island of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ensuring that the UK gives effect to this commitment is a significant focus of the Irish Government, and we have the full support of our EU partners and of the European Commission Task Force in this regard. I and my Department have been contributing actively to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade coordinated &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; approach to ensure such an outcome emanates from the negotiations.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing, close co-operation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland, including through dedicated working groups established as part of the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy Action Plan by the North/South Ministerial Council. The working groups focus on critical issues such as disease control, animal identification and movement, cross-border communication, data sharing and the development of joint initiatives on animal welfare.  </p>  <p>  I have hosted a number of all-island civic dialogue events to discuss the implications of Brexit across the agri-food sector.  These events provided important opportunities to engage directly in detail with stakeholders on the implications of Brexit and the potential responses that will be required as the negotiations unfold. The need to maintain an all-island approach to animal health/disease issues was discussed.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting the agriculture industry through the challenges ahead. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit for the sector, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. </p>  <p>  And, of course, ultimately Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the entire UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangement.</p></reply>

These habitats and species are listed in the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive (Directive 2009/147/EC). Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) &ndash; also known as Natura sites &ndash; are designated to afford protection to the most vulnerable of these habitats and species. As such, SACs and SPAs are a key component in the protection of rare and endangered habitats and species, both in Ireland and at a European and international level.</p><p>One of the key protective measures under this European legislation is the requirement under Article 6(3) and 6(4) of the Habitats Directive to apply an appropriate assessment procedure, to consider any possible impact on the conservation objectives of a Natura site that might arise from a plan or project, before a decision is taken whether or not to allow that plan or project to proceed. The application of appropriate assessment in Ireland is governed by the European Communities (Birds &amp;amp; Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 477 of 2011).</p><p>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is listed as a 'public authority' under these Regulations. Therefore, this Department is required to carry out a screening for Appropriate Assessment, and the Appropriate Assessment itself, if deemed necessary, in relation to all licence applications for afforestation in these areas. </p><p>With regard to Hen Harrier SPAs the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is currently developing a Threat Response Plan (TRP) for the conservation of Hen Harriers. Forestry will form an element of the Plan and my Department is working closely with NPWS on issues concerning forestry in Hen Harrier SPAs.

From an agri food perspective, this will include arrangements and resources to provide any necessary export certification for animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin destined for the UK, and to facilitate transit arrangements through the UK to the rest of the EU. These plans are at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade. Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular. </p>  <p>  In terms of the European dimension to our response, additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia has been used to support market diversification efforts by companies through its Market Prioritisation Programme, which was launched in late October 2016, and to support promotional campaigns for Irish beef in Germany and the Netherlands.</p>  <p>  In addition, Bord Bia has been providing information to companies on how to establish a presence in other EU countries, and using its network of offices to build long-term relationships in those markets, including through participation in trade fairs. It has also recently opened a new office in Warsaw to expand its support in Eastern Europe, and in Singapore to service eight emerging markets in South East Asia.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond Europe, Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  Trade Missions play an important role in this regard, and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf Region, the US, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada and China so far in 2018, with a further mission planned to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October. As normal, this latter mission will again include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  </p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

The long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector as a whole is &lsquo;an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production&rsquo;. The extent to which the sector can respond positively to climate change requirements is, however, qualified by the need to ensure that our capacity for sustainable food production is maintained.</p><p>The farming sector is actively engaging in a number of measures and actions focused on the environment and climate, which support the continued transition towards carbon neutrality.  Some examples include the<b></b>Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP), which is aimed at lowering the intensity of GHG emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd, the Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme, which offers opportunities to support emission reductions and carbon sequestration through various environmental priority actions such as hedgerow/tree planting and minimum tillage, and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). This last scheme supports capital investment to promote sustainability such as low emissions slurry spreading equipment and energy efficiency support measures.</p><p>I have also just announced a new pilot scheme called - The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot, which builds on the success of the BDGP.  This new pilot scheme will be targeted at suckler farmers and specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows.  </p><p>Afforestation also has an important role to play. It is the main cost effective land based mitigation tool available to us. The role afforestation and forests play with respect to climate mitigation is threefold: the direct sequestration of carbon in the forest and resulting wood products, replacing energy intensive materials and providing sustainable renewable biomass to the energy sector. Since 1990 almost 312,000 hectares have been afforested primarily by farmers with supports from my Department, which represents a 40% increase in forest cover. It is intended to expand our overall forest estate from 11% to 18% by 2050. </p><p>My Department is deeply involved both at national and international level on issues related to agriculture and climate.  We are engaging with organisations such as the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the EU Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use group. </p><p>On the home front we are engaged with colleagues across government in the National Mitigation planning process and adaptation planning. </p><p>Looking to the future, the recently published Teagasc report &ldquo;An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030&rdquo; highlights the potential for GHG abatement to limit the emissions from the sector over the period 2021 to 2030 based on current scientific knowledge against the likely level of future GHG emissions if no action is taken to address the emissions. It is an important piece of research that will inform developments in relation to future policy development. </p></reply>

This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  </p>  <p>  In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025, there has been an increasing focus in recent years on the use of Trade Missions to create and develop export opportunities for the Irish agri-food sector. Taking the last two years by way of example, I first of all led a very successful Trade Mission in February 2017 to the Gulf Region. This covered the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This was followed by an extensive Trade Mission to the US and Mexico in June. Both markets offer many aspects that are very attractive to Irish exporters. The US is the largest food and beverage market in the world and has a population of 324 million people. Around 35 million Americans also claim Irish ancestry. Mexico has a population of 127 million, making it the eleventh-largest country in the world in population terms and the fifteenth-largest economy in the world, with projections that it will move into the top five by 2050.</p>  <p>  During a trade mission to Japan and South Korea in November 2017 I was accompanied by 40 representatives of the Irish food sector, as well as by experts from my Department, the CEO of Bord Bia and senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc. </p>  <p>  This was a very opportune time to bring a delegation of Ireland&rsquo;s food leaders to this part of the world, given that the EU has concluded a Free Trade Agreement with South Korea as well as agreeing an Economic Partnership Agreement with Japan. Japan and South Korea are markets of high potential for beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat exports, and so it is important that we raise the profile of Irish agri-food enterprises that already have access to these markets, and make progress in negotiating access for others. </p>  <p>  This work has continued in 2018. I have already led trade missions to the US, Canada and China, and my Department is currently making the final arrangements for a further trade mission to Indonesia and Malaysia at the end of October. Again this will include participants from across the agri-food sector and will feature extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  Both of these markets have been identified by my Department as offering huge potential to the Irish agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  These and the other missions that my Department are planning for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.  It will also promote Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a producer of high quality, safe and sustainably produced meat and dairy products. The destinations are also in keeping with the recent market prioritisation exercise that was completed by Bord Bia at my request. This exercise identified opportunities in new and more mature markets, and will provide valuable market intelligence both for industry operators and policy makers.</p>  <p>  It is also no coincidence that the destinations that we have recently visited and plan to visit are now some of the countries showing the greatest increase in growth, with the value of exports to Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America standing at almost &euro;2.8 billion in 2017. The value of trade to these markets increased by 159% since 2009.  These markets now account for over 20% of total agri-food exports.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia, with exports of &euro;1.6 billion in 2017, of which around &euro;1 billion went to China. Exports to other Asian markets grew by 85% since 2012 to &euro;659 million in 2017. Trade to Africa has also grown to &euro;606 million, while exports to the Middle East have also grown significantly, to reach &euro;370 million. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to seek out and identify new markets, and I am ready to respond as appropriate to other opportunities that may arise.</p></reply>

On fisheries, it is very welcome that the maintenance of reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources is proposed in the European Council Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The actual agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is, after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. This is why a status quo transitional arrangement is so important. Of course, it is in the interest of everyone that a future relationship agreement is concluded as quickly as possible after the UK leaves the EU to provide certainty sooner rather than later.  </p>  <p>  It is very welcome that the European Council has proposed that the whole of the EU acquis will apply to the UK during the transition, which means that in the context of a Withdrawal Agreement  the status quo will be preserved with the aim of avoiding any gaps or cliff edge effects between the UK leaving the EU and when a future relationship agreement enters into force. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that, working together with the Tanaiste and his team and the Barnier Task Force, I will continue to work  to ensure that negotiations on fisheries remain inextricably linked to the overall future relationship negotiations in order to protect our existing access rights and quota entitlements. </p>  <p>  Overall, it is Ireland&rsquo;s view that the EU27&rsquo;s basic position should be to protect all EU fishing communities. While all parties would like higher quotas, the way to achieve that is to grow the stocks through sustainable management for the benefit of all.</p></reply>

Total agri-food exports amounted to &euro;13.6 billion in 2017, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) trade statistics, an increase of 74% since 2009.  </p><p>CSO Trade statistics for beef and sheep meat exports 2015-2017 are detailed in the table: <table><tr><th>-</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro; 000</td><td>&euro; 000</td><td>&euro; 000</td></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>2,209,065</td><td>2,267,383</td><td>2,406,834</td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td>241,893</td><td>277,106</td><td>310,872</td></tr></table></p><p>According to the CSO trade statistics, by the end of July 2018 beef exports were approx &euro;1.4 billion, an increase of 4% in value terms compared to the same period in 2017. According to the CSO trade statistics, by the end of July 2018 sheepmeat exports were approx &euro;180 million, an increase of 3% in value terms compared to the same period in 2017.</p><p>My officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible. This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit, and is in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. Opening new markets involves a wide range of detailed work taking place across a range of levels including political, diplomatic, technical and official levels. </p><p>I am delighted that already in 2018 the Chinese market has opened to Irish beef. Three Irish beef establishments were approved to export to China in April and a further three Irish beef establishments were approved in June following on from my Trade Mission to China in May. Beef access has been achieved as a result of huge effort by Team Ireland; Ministers, Departmental officials, the Irish Embassy in Beijing and agencies including Bord Bia over several years. Beef exports to China have now commenced.  My Department has also recently agreed Veterinary Health Certificates for the export of beef, sheepmeat and poultry to both Kuwait and Qatar. These certificates apply for meat and meat products and are a result of a joined-up effort between my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in  particular the Embassy in the United Arab Emirates, also accredited to Kuwait and Qatar. </p><p>I hope that these new markets will positively contribute towards another successful year for the Irish beef  &amp;amp; sheepmeat industry and our exports. However, the role of the Department is to open up new markets and increase opportunities, while taking advantage of these new markets and availing of these new opportunities is a matter for the industry themselves.  </p><p>I recently launched an online international market access information portal which provides information across some of the major agri-food export sectors of dairy, meat, seafood and live animals.  The information provided includes certification arrangements, exporter terms and conditions, individual country trading statistics and the typical products exported to individual markets. This portal is a very valuable tool for our producers and exporters.  As new markets are opened or certification conditions are changed, this will of course be reflected by the necessary changes to the web portal. The portal can be accessed at www.marketaccess.agriculture.gov.ie/.</p></reply>

Crop production as a whole including Horticulture, contributes in the region of &euro;700 million annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices.</p>  <p>  In particular, the cereals sector is a major contributor to livestock production providing high quality grain to the animal feeding industry. The cereal sector is also a key source of seed production as well grain for the milling and malting industry and is therefore a significant stakeholder in our agri-food industry from a supply/food safety and sustainability viewpoint. I am most conscious that the maintenance of an efficient and viable tillage sector in Ireland is of the utmost importance as it reduces our dependence on imported cereals. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that cereal production has experienced difficult challenges in recent times in terms of weather conditions throughout the spring and summer of this year. In relation to cereal markets, Ireland only accounts for approximately 1% of EU production. Grain prices here are very much affected by European and world market price shifts linked to supply/demand issues and tend to experience volatility. The current situation for the cereal sector is that it has experienced, as a result of the drought in Europe, a spike in prices and a drop in the harvest forecast for the 28 Member States including Ireland. </p>  <p>  I would like to add that my Department has provided and continues to provide, a range of supports to assist this vital sector. In 2017, I introduced the &euro;150m Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and extended it through provision of national exchequer funding to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors. As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II covers specific areas of investment with over &euro;3.9 million paid out to tillage farmers to date. My Department announced earlier this year the extension of the Protein Aid Scheme with the same level of funding as 2017. Furthermore in August this year I announced a &euro;2.75 million fodder production incentive measure for tillage farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been very positive engagement.    </p>  <p>  My Department additionally provides a high quality official crop seed certification scheme to the industry, in addition to an extensive national crop variety evaluation programme. </p>  <p>  The agri-food sector is exploring the development of niche and specialist markets for cereal products which have the potential to improve competitiveness and sustainability. The demand for Irish malting barley is growing in line with the sustained growth in demand for Irish whiskey. The opportunity offered by maximizing the amount of Irish grain must be developed to the benefit of all involved. </p>  <p>  In conclusion I would also encourage tillage growers to fully implement the advice and research provided by Teagasc in relation to efficient and sustainable production of crops. I am committed to this important sector which plays a key role in the development of the wider agri-food industry. </p></reply>

The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance. Inspection finding reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.  Veterinary checks are carried out on consignments of foods imported from Third countries outside the EU.  100% of consignments are documentary and identity checked and physical checks, including sampling of products, are carried out according to European regulations.</p>  <p>  Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators. The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement. This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place. These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.</p></reply>

However despite these challenges the industry continues to be very resilient and has benefited from the long term relationships built up with its UK retail customers. </p><p>Access arrangements to the UK market post-Brexit will depend on the outcome of the UK&rsquo;s Brexit negotiations with the EU. Ireland's objective in the negotiations is to have a trading relationship with the UK which is as close as possible to the current arrangements. The Government will be firm in arguing that any agreement reached between the EU and the UK must take account of the very serious challenges presented by Brexit, particularly given the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and the importance of our economic relationship with the UK. </p><p>Additionally, my Department and its State Agencies are currently providing supports on a number of fronts to the sector. </p><p>The EU Producer Organisation (PO) Scheme continues to be a vital support mechanism for mushroom growers, with 80% of Irish growers in a producer organisation at present. This EU funded scheme provides a mechanism for producers to work together to optimise production costs, stabilise prices and strengthen their position in the market place by becoming part of a larger supply base. Through the funding under the PO scheme, the industry has been focused on improving competitiveness through the implementation of LEAN processes and technologies. </p><p>An Bord Bia has commenced a 3-year mushroom promotion campaign on the Irish and UK markets. This campaign is co-funded by the industry and the European Commission. It is important to emphasise that the overall market for mushrooms in the UK and Ireland remains strong, showing good potential for further growth.</p><p>For the wider horticultural sector the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector continues to be the main support for individual growers in the horticulture industry who wish to make capital investments in specialised equipment or buildings. Funding under Budget 2019 for capital investments in the commercial horticulture sector has been increased by an additional &euro;1 million to &euro;6 million for 2019 in response to strong demand for investment within the sector and the emerging challenges of Brexit, further reflecting this Government's commitment to ongoing support for the sector.</p><p>The new <b>Brexit Loan Scheme</b>aims also to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees). This will give Brexit-impacted businesses, including potentially a number of mushroom exporters time and space to adapt and to grow into the future.</p><p>I am very much committed to working with the mushroom sector to assist it in adjusting to the challenges that lie ahead.</p></reply>

The Act provides the framework within which the welfare of animals can be safeguarded and I am hopeful that the substantial and significantly increased levels of penalties for offences of animal cruelty provided for under the Act will act as a deterrent to animal welfare abuses.</p>  <p>  Officials form my Department are directly involved in monitoring  animal welfare on farms as part of their inspection duties  in the areas of animal health, food safety, transportation and welfare. My Department also actively works via the regional Early Warning System to ensure that potential welfare problems in farming are identified at an early stage and wherever possible avoided.</p>  <p>  This work is further underpinned by the Animal Welfare Helpline which my Department operates, Lo-call  0761 064408 , along with a dedicated email address, AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie, which facilitates the reporting by members of the public of concerns in regard to the welfare of animals.  All calls received are treated in confidence. The animal welfare hotline exists for the reporting of specific incidents relating to animal welfare which come to the attention of members of the public, which they believe are in need of attention. All complaints received are investigated and followed up on.</p>  <p>  Control in respect of animal welfare is a matter that is also dealt with by a wider range of organisations not just my Department. In the case of  non farmed animals, a vital role is  played by An G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and authorised officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA. These latter are some of the many recipients of substantial  ex-gratia funding which my Department provides to underpin important work done by many organisations in the area of supporting animal welfare. In December 2017, I announced  the largest ever Department allocation of funding to animal welfare organisations of &euro;2,560,000. A total of 111 organisations are benefitting under these arrangements.</p></reply>

The Irish sport horse is a versatile animal which is adaptable for most disciplines including polo.  However, it should be noted that the discipline of Polo prefers equines with Thoroughbred blood to ensure sufficient speed and stamina particularly where individual riders progress to the higher ranks in the sport.  There already exists strong linkages between sport horses with Thoroughbred blood and the polo sector and such horses have played a significant role in the development of high performance polo ponies around the world.</p>  <p>  Polo has a long tradition in Ireland and the number of participants is small (estimated to be less than 150) with the number of horses involved estimated to be less than 600.  </p>  <p>  I consider that the current sport horse population is not a limiting factor to the further development of the sport in Ireland. </p></reply>

These include supports for artisan food businesses, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach and festival markets.</p>  <p>  Supports for the artisan food sector are available from the development agencies. Many artisan businesses have participated in the Food Academy programme developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves/Supervalu; the Food Works programme (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs) and from technical assistance from Teagasc. </p>  <p>  In terms of small food businesses in general, close to 500 food companies with a turnover of &euro;100,000 to &euro;3.5m are registered with Bord Bia for supports and services. These owner managed businesses produce high-end products with a strong focus on the domestic market.</p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese-makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million per annum at farm gate level. The sector is innovative with over 17 new farmhouse cheeses developed in the past year. My Department has supported a three year Bord Bia farmhouse cheese programme under the EU Promotion regime. </p>  <p>  Farmers markets remain a valuable entry point for many potential food entrepreneurs and those building a local and visitor customer base. In the past year Bord Bia ran workshops for market managers to support the development of this important local route to market. Feedback was highly positive. </p>  <p>  My Department provides bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and /or promoting the artisan sector. Bord Bia, Teagasc and the FSAI contribute to the work of the Diploma. Over 180 students have graduated; many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses. </p>  <p>  Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy. </p>  <p>  There is provision in the Rural Development Programme (RDP), for funding to support new and existing artisan, micro and small food producers to address emerging challenges through investment in areas such as market development, competitiveness and innovation. This funding  is being  delivered using the LEADER methodology. Earlier this year, my colleague Minister Ring and I launched  the &lsquo;LEADER Food Initiative&rsquo;  for the artisan/small food and beverage businesses, which provides for funding of &euro;15 million up to 2020. </p>  <p>  The Initiative  provides financial supports, including for the renovation and extension of production facilities and the purchasing of processing equipment, as well as supporting participants in the artisan food and beverage sector in areas such as market development, competitiveness, and innovation.The maximum amount of funding available is &euro;200,000 per project and funding will be provided for both capital investment and softer supports related to analysis and development or training. This includes support for collaborative proposals where food businesses jointly address common processing and marketing challenges.</p></reply>

The main aim of the scheme, which began in 2016 is to validate, in an Irish context, the strong international evidence that making homes warmer, drier and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people vulnerable to energy poverty, who are living with chronic respiratory conditions.</p>  <p>  The scheme is currently available in the HSE Community Health Area 7 in Dublin postal areas 8, 10, 12, 22 and 24, and my department is engaging with the health authorities to examine implementation in areas with characteristics of rural areas, with different settlement pattern a housing stock. The initial 3 year phase of the scheme will conclude at the end of this year, with the full allocation of &euro;20m being spent and nearly 1,000 homes upgraded. There is already strong evidence of benefits of these upgrades to the health and wellbeing of participants. There are two strands to decision making around the future of the Warmth and Wellbeing approach, relating to health and energy. From the health perspective, the measurement and evaluation of the data gathered from participants is necessary to validate the effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements in supporting better health outcomes. From the energy perspective, an effective delivery infrastructure has been established by SEAI and the HSE in the pilot area, but more does need to be learned on the ground about how to scale this up, not least in the context of how we ramp up to meet the level of ambition in the NDP. Based on the outcomes of this first phase I will be considering the optimal next steps, bearing in mind that the quality of the client experience must be the first priority in any consideration of a wider roll out.</p></reply>

I am not therefore in a position to provide detailed progress updates on its work. </p>  <p>  The Commission has prepared three Interim Reports to date, in July 2016, September 2016 and September 2017. I have published all three reports and the Commission is continuing with its work under the leadership of Judge Yvonne Murphy, Dr William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly. The Commission is due to submit its final reports in February next year. </p>  <p>  It is not possible for a Government to consider a response to an independent statutory investigation, including any question of financial compensation, prior to the Commission submitting its final reports. To date the Commission has made no findings about abuse or neglect in any of the institutions within its terms of reference. </p>  <p>  The Commission must be given the opportunity to conclude its investigation and to establish the facts of what happened in and around these institutions. I know that many former residents are eagerly awaiting the completion of this work. As I have indicated previously, when the final reports of the Commission are available the Government will be in a position to comprehensively respond to the full account of the Commission&rsquo;s conclusions on all matters regarding the experiences of former residents. </p>  <p>  In the interim, I have initiated a number of processes to complement the Commission's work. I have established an inclusive and representative Collaborative Forum so that former residents of these institutions can directly engage on the issues of concern to them and their families. I was very happy to meet with the Forum at its first meeting in July. I understand that they have made further progress by establishing sub-committees at their second meeting last month. I have requested an initial report within 6 months and await the outcome of their deliberations.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants.</p>  <p>  While the motion called for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to meet with unions with a view to addressing the issue of CE supervisors&rsquo; pension provision, the issue is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments including my own Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that while the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector. Any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

No. 477/2011), both of which prohibit the spreading of invasive species. My Department is currently drafting a Statutory Instrument giving effect to measures in the EU invasive alien species Regulation.  This will update and strengthen the existing legislative framework in Ireland and provide authorised officers with the appropriate powers to implement the EU Regulation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  A key component of the EU Regulation is a list of invasive alien species of Union concern (known as the Union list), for which concerted measures are required across the EU. The EU Regulation imposes restrictions on the keeping, importing, selling, breeding and growing of the listed species. Member States are also required to take measures for the early detection and rapid eradication of species which have recently arrived, or to manage populations that are already widely spread in their territory. Prevention is the priority because established populations are invariably expensive to manage and difficult or impossible to eradicate. My Department is drafting management plans as required and will consult relevant Departments and experts over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The first Union list of 37 species was adopted in July 2016 and this was updated in July 2017 with a further 12 species, bringing the total number of listed species to 49. The American Mink is not included on the Union list at this time.  </p>  <p>  The Scientific Forum on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), which consists of representatives of the scientific community appointed by  Member States, provides advice on scientific questions related to the implementation of the EU IAS Regulation. The Scientific forum is currently reviewing 20 new risk assessments for species, including American Mink to be considered for the next update of the Union list. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service are engaged in this process and a decision on the proposed species to be added to the Union list is expected in the first half of 2019.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s most recent Article 12 report noted that one species, the Corn Bunting, is now extinct as a breeding bird in Ireland. This farmland bird was associated with arable farming and was common in the coastal counties of Ireland in the early 1900s but experienced a decline in numbers and breeding range over the following decades. By the early 1990s the population was thought to be less than 30 pairs. No confirmed breeding records are available for this century indicating that this farmland songbird species became extinct in the intervening period. </p>  <p>  The latest list of Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland (north and south), produced by BirdWatch Ireland  and The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, identifies several other farmland songbirds as being of particular conservation concern (e.g. Twite, Yellowhammer, Whinchat) as well as game birds (e.g. Grey Partridge, Red Grouse, Woodcock), breeding waders (e.g. Curlew, Dunlin and Golden Plover), ducks (e.g. Pintail, Shoveler, Common Scoter) and others (e.g. Corncrake, Barn Owl).</p>  <p>  My Department operates and/or funds, a number of conservation programmes, as resources allow, aimed at improving the status of some of these species including Curlew, Grey Partridge and Corncrake.</p></reply>

Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage.  The plan includes a provision of &euro;40 million to ensure a regional balance and secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide.  In this context, the Department will work with local and regional authorities.   </p>  <p>  In terms of investment in County Wicklow,under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018, two organisations in County Wicklow were successful and have been allocated funding. These were Mermaid County Wicklow Arts Centre and Tinahely Courthouse CLG t/a The Courthouse Arts Centre. Both organisations have been active in drawing down their funding and this will continue into 2019.  This Scheme will make a huge difference to each of the individual organisations and my Department is already seeing good outcomes and receiving positive feedback. My Department is currently giving consideration to new round of grant funding under Arts and Cultural Capital Scheme to be announced in the near future.</p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this scheme in 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;113,195 was provided in grant aid under this scheme for 17 projects in County Wicklow. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund supports conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund in 2018. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, a total of &euro;94,000 was allocated to 5 projects in County Wicklow. Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites.</p>  <p>  In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of Project Ireland 2040. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p>  <p>  In addition, through the National Monuments Service (NMS), my Department continues to assess notices of intention to carry out work at, or close to, recorded monuments. Such notices are required under the National Monuments Acts 1930-2014. NMS also responds to reports of threat to monuments to ensure the ongoing protection of our archaeological heritage.</p></reply>

In brief, if the assessment procedure shows there is no significant risk of impact, then a project may proceed.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are in contact with the European Commission in regard to the obligations of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, and guidance on same, on a frequent basis.
