    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 92 together.</p><p>The Government recognises the important role that family carers play in Irish society and is fully committed to their support through a range of supports and services. </p><p>The main income supports to carers provided by my Department include Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant. Spending on these payments in 2022 is expected to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p><p>The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. </p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include the following changes to the carer means test which will take effect in June:  </p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner,</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>A more generous means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance has been called for over successive Budgets by organisations representing carers.  An increase in the general weekly income disregard will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and therefore provide an income support to carers, whose earning capacity is significantly constrained as a consequence of their caring responsibilities.</p><p>Increasing the capital disregard will allow carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings, often to provide sufficient moneys to care for a loved one, to retain these savings without it impacting upon their carer&rsquo;s payment.  It also brings the capital formula applied to savings in the means assessment for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in line with Disability Allowance.</p><p>Notwithstanding the increased level of support already in place for carers, my Department will keep these measures under review as part of the annual budgetary process.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA00900"><p>As I have already emphasised, the Government is fully supportive of the important role that family carers play in Irish society and is fully committed to their support through a range of supports and services.  My Department provides a range of income supports to family carers including Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance, and the Carer's Support Grant. </p><p>There are currently 90,896 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  This represents an increase of 74% in the past 10 years, from 52,209 in 2012.  The average time to award the Alllowance was 4 weeks in 2021, as compared to 14 weeks in 2019.  My department understands the many pressures faced by carers and always seeks to ensure that claims are handled quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Decisions regarding the means test are taken in a budgetary context and are therefore subject to discussions with other relevant departments in the usual way. </p><p>I have made sure to speak to carer representatives myself to understand their concerns, and my Department engages with carer groups regularly.  This level of engagement has helped inform some considerable improvements that have been introduced for carers in recent years, including:</p><p>- In Budget 2020, the number of hours a carer could engage in education, training or employment was increased from 15 to 18.5 hours.</p><p>- In Budget 2021, the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant was increased by &euro;150 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850 per year.</p><p>The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  </p><p>From June, as a result of the measures I announced in Budget 2022, the following improvements will be made to the carer means test:</p><p>- An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p><p>- An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA01300"><p>My Department is committed to providing high quality services to help people who are long term unemployed prepare for and secure employment.  It does this through a combination of directly provided services and contracted services.  Under national and EU procurement rules, and as advised by the Attorney General and the Chief States Solicitor's Office, contracted services must be procured via open and competitive procurement. </p><p>My Department is therefore procuring a new Local Area Employment Service over two distinct phases.  Phase one of the process for procuring new employment services involved seven counties in the Midlands and North West who did not have a Local Employment Service.  Contracts were signed last December and services are in the process of being mobilised.</p><p>Phase two of the process has now commenced, with the publication of the request for tender in December for seventeen lots covering 19 counties.  Services for this phase will begin in July 2022.</p><p>While I am aware of the media reports the Deputy is referring to, I obviously cannot comment on potential bids to what is a live procurement process. </p><p>I can however say that, as with every open competitive procurement, it is open to any entity to submit a tender.  Of course any tender submitted must meet certain qualifying criteria laid out in the tender documents.  Provided it does so it will then be considered on its own merits, in line with procurement law.  This does not mean that the tender submitted must succeed but it does mean that it has the opportunity to be considered.  This is how legal procurement works.</p><p>I would emphasise that under the procurement process for Local Area Employment Services now underway, 80% of the award criteria marks are related to the quality of the service, its community linkages, and its impact on social value.  The experience from Phase 1 shows that community and voluntary groups can and did succeed, securing contracts in two of the three lots where they submitted a tender.  I am therefore confident that community and voluntary based providers who work collaboratively and submit high quality bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract.  <b></b></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300072#WRA01600"><p>The Treatment Benefit schemes, which include dental, optical and hearing services are available to insured workers, the self-employed and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions.  These treatments are also available to their dependent spouse or partner if applicable.&euro;109 million was spent on the scheme in 2021.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I announced an expansion to the range of services available under the scheme. A new grant will be provided from 28 May 2022 towards the cost of wigs and hairpieces for people who suffer from hair loss due to disease.</p><p>A grant of up to &euro;500 will be available once every calendar year to support people towards the cost of non-surgical hair replacement.  This amount can be added to by the person if they wish to purchase a more expensive product. </p><p>Hair loss is a common issue among people that can be caused by a variety of medical conditions including autoimmune diseases such as alopecia or systemic conditions like cancer.  I recognise not only the physical impact, but also the psychological impact, that sudden hair loss can have on a person&rsquo;s life.  I hope that this new grant will contribute to improving the quality of life of those who need it.  It will only be available for hair loss in respect of a disease and not due to ageing or other natural causes. </p><p>Approximately 2.25 million people qualify for Treatment Benefit.  It is difficult to estimate the level of take-up of this new benefit.  For example, 25,000 people get diagnosed with invasive cancer annually and it is anticipated that up to 2,000 of them may apply for the grant.  The estimated cost of the new grant is &euro;1 million per year. </p></reply>

In addition, my Department is responsible for ensuring good governance of employment service provision, which requires greater oversight and enhanced visibility of service provision.</p><p>I can say that, as with every open competitive procurement, it is open to any entity to submit a tender.  Of course any tender submitted must meet certain qualifying criteria laid out in the tender documents.  Provided it does so it will then be considered on its own merits, in line with procurement law.  This is how legal procurement works.  </p><p>I would emphasise that under the procurement process for Local Area Employment Services now underway, 80% of the award criteria marks are related to the quality of the service, its community linkages, and its impact on social value.</p><p>The experience from Phase 1 shows that community and voluntary groups can and did succeed.  I am therefore confident that community and voluntary based providers who work collaboratively and submit high quality bids will be in a strong competitive position to secure a contract.  The publicity relating to the possibility of new market entrants shouldn't distract from the ability of existing service providers to submit high-quality bids for the new service, particularly as my Department has worked hard to take on board feedback from phase 1 of the process.  As part of this feedback process, and prior to issuing the request for tender, the Department met with existing service providers and representative bodies and also took a number of brief introductory video call with interested parties at their request.  The purpose of these was to outline the proposed tender process and timelines.</p><p>I am sure that the quality-first approach which is now part of the phase 2 tender will ensure that, as we expand employment services throughout the State, we retain a focus on providing the best possible service to the long-term unemployed.</p></reply>

The research has implications for many areas of public policy including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports. </p><p>In order to implement an all-Department response, the Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte. </p><p>This Group has oversight of monitoring the key frameworks for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and it is in this regard that the Government saw it fitting that this group would be the appropriate monitoring vehicle.  </p><p>It will consider and monitor actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of this report on a bi-annual basis. </p><p>All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implemented and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report.</p><p>From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers, which will go towards alleviating the financial costs experienced.  These include a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards as well as supports to employers. </p><p>Furthermore, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  I have asked my officials to revisit the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal to take on board the findings in the Cost of Disability research.</p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The outcome of this open and transparent procurement process was not contested by any party.  </p><p>I understand that all former Job Club staff in Laois/Offaly were offered employment on their existing terms and conditions by the new service provider, I also understand that early last month the staff commenced training with the successful new provider.  Accordingly, no person has lost employment or has seen any reduction in their terms and conditions.</p><p>I am not aware of any Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) recommendation on this matter.  However, on 15 December 2021, the WRC did write to my Department regarding ongoing work stoppages in Job Clubs in Offaly and Laois.  I understand that these stoppages related to the protests regarding the procurement process generally and that no formal dispute has been registered with the new service provider.</p><p>My Department is not the employer of any of its service partners' staff.  Neither is it a party to an industrial dispute with any of its service partners or their employees.  It would therefore be inappropriate for the Department to engage in discussions at the WRC, which is a forum to resolve disputes between an employer and their employees.  However, the Department has advised the WRC that it is available to provide any information or clarification directly to the WRC if required.</p></reply>

In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, the Budget package included a number of targeted measures.</p><p>This focused approach to supporting those in greatest need is guided by evidence-based research produced by organisations such as the ERSI and the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.  In addition to the increases in core rates of payment, these targeted increases ensure that additional resources are directed to groups most at risk of poverty.  </p><p>For example, a lone parent with two children under 12 years will see their income increase by &euro;14 per week during the fuel season.</p><p>In addition, as energy prices were increasing, I ensured the the increase to the fuel allowance rate was implemented from Budget week.</p><p>In terms of inflation generally, it is recognised that there are three main drivers to the increase in prices that we have been seeing: </p><p>-  There was a slight decrease in prices over the course of 2020, or deflation.  The increase in prices we are seeing since last year is partly as a result of prices recovering from this low base.  Higher inflation rates today reflect, in part, the fall in price levels from a year ago.</p><p>-  There have been global supply chain disruptions.  This mismatch between supply and demand puts pressure on prices.</p><p>-  There has been welcome economic growth in Ireland and elsewhere, but this has had an impact on energy prices.  Ireland is not unique in experiencing energy price inflation.</p><p>The Central Bank last week noted that higher inflation rates should be viewed in the context of many years of persistently low inflation before the pandemic and the current unusual economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession.  It currently expects prices to stabilise later this year.</p><p>I am very conscious of the need to monitor this situation carefully, particularly its impact on those most vulnerable, and I will continue to do so.</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>According to CSO figures, the rate of supplementary pension coverage is around 56% of the working population (Pension Coverage Survey 2021).  It is estimated that this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  As a consequence of this low supplementary pension coverage rate, many retirees may suffer an unwanted reduction in living standards when they retire.</p><p>This Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are under as a result of the COVID-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an AE system based on the following principles:</p><p>-  There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contributions made by workers and employers.</p><p>-  Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up those contributions.</p><p>-  There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out.</p><p>-  Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from.</p><p>-  There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising a proposal for Government on the overall design of the AE system and I intend to bring that to Government for consideration in the near future.  If that proposal is approved I will be publishing the design in detail and it will include, amongst many other things, the level of contributions to be made by all involved and over what timeframe, the types of investment approaches that will be available, and the likely numbers of people who will be encompassed by the programme.</p><p>Once the final design is agreed it is intended that the necessary legislative, organisational and process structures for its implementation will follow over the course of this year and next, as set out in the Economic Recovery Plan 2021.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

It is, however, important for employers to be aware that, alongside these skills shortages, there remains a pool of labour available with approximately 163,500 people on the Live Register and 80,000 on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment as of last week.  </p><p>While many of those on PUP are now returning to work with the full re-opening of the economy, some will remain unemployed post COVID.  My priority is to support all unemployed persons find jobs.</p><p>Under Pathways to Work 2021-2025, Intreo is strengthening its engagement with employers and supporting them to recruit unemployed jobseekers.  Actions include:</p><p>-  Develop and implement a promotional campaign to increase employer awareness and take-up of the available supports.</p><p>-  Host a series of employer roadshows around the country to showcase examples of how employers can, and have benefitted, from the employment supports available.  I intend to schedule these roadshows over the coming months. </p><p>-  Host 150 Job Promotion Events (virtual or in person) each year to showcase employment opportunities and to facilitate the introduction of employers and jobseekers.</p><p>-  Develop, with the support of the Labour Market Advisory Council sub-group on employer engagement, a new employer relations strategy to further strengthen linkages with employers.</p><p>-  Undertake regular surveys of employers&rsquo; assessment of public employment and further education and training services to help identify employer needs/opinions and track their satisfaction with the services.</p><p>Under Pathways, Government is also investing in a range of training, reskilling and work experience programmes to assist job seekers who need to re-train or up skill to avail of employment opportunities now available in the labour market. </p><p>The Department of Social Protection, through Intreo, provides a range of services and supports to employers to recruit unemployed jobseekers, including  the enhanced JobsPlus recruitment subsidy for employers who recruit jobseekers, and the JobsIreland &amp;amp; EURES recruitment portals.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A number of MWP report recommendations focused on the need to support young adults through education, training and social inclusion according to their capacity, and to change the qualifying age for disability allowance from 16 to 18 years of age while leaving Domiciliary Care allowance in payment where applicable to 18 years of age.  </p>  <p>  An extensive national consultation process was organised to engage people with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, and sectoral representatives to seek their views on the specific recommendations in the report. </p>  <p>  Consideration of the most appropriate measures to be taken is continuing.

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. </p>  <p>  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. </p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of illness benefit, for a limited period.  The enhanced rate is &euro;350, with additional payments in respect of dependent adults and children. </p>  <p>  From March 2020 this enhanced benefit was payable for up to 2 weeks where a person was isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, and up to 10 weeks where a person had been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Expenditure on this payment was almost &euro;106 million in 2021.</p>  <p>  The duration of payment for those considered a probable risk was reduced to 7 days from 14 January 2022, in line with government guidelines.  From that date, asymptomatic people who are close contacts and who have had their immunity boosted are not required to restrict their movements, and therefore Enhanced Illness Benefit will not be paid to these individuals.  If, however, they start showing symptoms they should immediately self-isolate and, in this circumstance, may apply for the enhanced Illness Benefit payment.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Illness Benefit is payable for up to two years, depending on satisfying the eligibility conditions.  </p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.     </p>  <p>  My Department keeps the range of income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard. </p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  That Committee published its views yesterday.  I and my officials will obviously include these in our deliberations over the coming weeks. Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and in this regard are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

For employers the greater use of digital technology and remote working are now well embedded and will persist. </p>  <p>  Last year my colleague, Leo Varadkar TD, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment published the Government&rsquo;s National Remote Work Strategy &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo;.  The strategy sets out a road map on a number of issues, such as the facilitating of remote working on a legal basis and mapping and investing in a network of remote working hubs across Ireland.  An important commitment in the Strategy is to introduce a new law giving workers the right to request to remote work.  The recently published Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2022 is part of the Government's vision to make remote working a more permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all &ndash; economically, socially and environmentally.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development I launched the Connected Hubs Network, Ireland&rsquo;s first national network of remote working hubs.  At present, there are 178 hubs already using the ConnectedHubs.ie platform.  As we look to the reopening of our country, I am determined that we make remote working a permanent and viable reality for thousands of people and for businesses.</p>  <p>  In Pathways to Work, my Department commits to engaging with new digital development by taking advantage of online service capabilities to extend the reach and efficiency of our service delivery.  This includes hosting a number of job promotion events to match jobseekers with jobs, including with  remote working opportunities in full or in part.  In this way we can harness the opportunities provided by the positive experience of remote working during the pandemic to further support access to employment for all.</p>  <p>  Under the Government's Employment Services Strategy, Pathways to Work, my Department has put in place a wide range of measures to assist those out of work find new jobs.  These measures include commitments to host 150 Job Promotion Events (virtual or in person) each year to showcase employment opportunities and to facilitate the introduction of employers and jobseekers.  Also, two national Intreo Work and Skills Weeks will be held each year, one virtual and one in person.  Each of these will involves a week of intensive jobs focussed job promotion events and seminars across the country. </p>  <p>  As part of these events, my Department will engage with employers to match jobseekers with new jobs including remote working opportunities.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date a total of 416,175 COVID Illness Benefit related claims have been processed of which 382,587 have received a payment.  </p>  <p>  The majority of the standard Illness Benefit claims are automatically processed once medical certification from a GP and an application from the customer has been received.</p>  <p>  Applications for the Covid Enhanced Illness Benefit increased significantly during January due to transmission of the Omicron variant.  An average of 31,300 applications were received weekly as compared to 8,000 per week in December.  Despite this increase, 92% of these applications are processed within a week.  Applications that require manual intervention are taking approximately 2 weeks.

The scheme offers participants the opportunity to gain valuable work experience in their communities.</p>  <p>  To qualify for RSS, a person must be actively farming or fishing, and satisfy the means test assessment required to qualify for the Farm Assist (FA) payment.   </p>  <p>  During 2017 and 2018 the number of places funded on RSS was increased by 750, bringing the total number of places available to 3,350.  A six-year time limit was also introduced for new RSS participants with effect from February 2017.  The limit was introduced to ensure that there will be places available for newer cohorts of eligible persons and aligns the RSS with other employment support programmes.  This limit only applies to new entrants to RSS from February 2017.</p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of the six year time limit, an RSS participant could remain on the scheme for a significant part of their working life.  This had the effect of limiting turnover of places on RSS and thereby reducing the opportunities for potential new entrants.</p>  <p>  On 21st December last, Minister Humphreys and I were pleased to announce a number of changes to RSS and the community employment schemes.  These changes included a provision to allow an RSS participant who reaches 60 years of age to remain on the scheme until they reach State pension age - which will immediately directly apply to existing RSS participants over sixty years of age who commenced on the scheme since 2017.  This will benefit some 390 participants who will now be able to remain on the scheme until they reach retirement age.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation in RSS derives from Farm Assist, with the Farm Assist means assessment applying to the scheme.  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 to review the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist.  As part of this review process it was recommended to provide for an extensive expansion to the list of Agri-Environmental schemes which will qualify towards the disregard of &euro;2,540.  These measures have now been enacted in the Social Welfare Act 2022 and will be implemented from June 2022.  These changes have an added benefit of increasing the number of people who could potentially apply for the RSS scheme, through being in receipt of Farm Assist.</p>  <p>  The Department continually monitors all of its employment support programmes and intends to complete a review of the operation of the RSS later in 2022.</p></reply>

To be eligible, the disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the person must be aged between 16 and 66 years of age.  The allowance is also subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency requirement. </p><p>People receiving Disability Allowance may also be eligible for secondary benefits such as free travel, fuel allowance, the household benefits package, the living alone allowance and the telephone support allowance. </p><p>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant are the main income supports provided by my Department to carers in the community.  Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a means tested payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who require full-time care and attention.  Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the household benefits package and a free travel pass.  However, my Department does not provide grants for the purchase of vehicles.</p><p>In acknowledgement of the crucial role that family carers play in our society and the challenges faced by those with disabilities I introduced a number of measures as part of Budget 2022 in relation to supports provided by my Department.  These include:</p><p>-  &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments - including disability and carers, which came into effect this month (January),</p><p>-  Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60,</p><p>-  Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week, effective from June 2022,</p><p>-  An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 from next June,</p><p>-  An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner, also from June,</p><p>-  Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week.  (The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120. This represents a 20% increase and enables more people to qualify for this support).</p><p>For those in financial difficulty, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance is also available.  This is a means-tested payment available through the Department's Intreo Centres.</p><p>The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  </p><p>I trust that the Deputy will find this information useful.</p></reply>

The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, funding was provided for a pilot scheme from September 2019, providing hot school meals in primary schools at a cost of &euro;1m for 2019 and &euro;2.5m in 2020.  The pilot involved 37 schools benefitting 6,744 students for the 2019/2020 academic year and was aimed primarily at schools with no onsite cooking facilities.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021, I announced that an additional &euro;5.5m to extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option.  Invitations for expressions of interest were issued to 705 primary schools (612 DEIS and 93 non-DEIS) in November 2020.  A total of 281 (256 DEIS and 25 non-DEIS) expressions of interest were received in respect of 52,148 children.</p>  <p>  The 35,000 places were allocated to each local authority area based on the number of children applied by local authority as a percentage of the total number.  A minimum of one school for each Local Authority area was selected.  Thereafter, a process of random selection was used for each area.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 is providing for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the 81 DEIS schools that submitted an expression of interest but were not selected in the extension to 35,000 children as referred to earlier.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme for DEIS schools and building further on the significant extension announced as part of Budget 2022.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme. </p>  <p>  Any extension of the school meals programme or the hot school meals beyond 2022 will need to be considered as part of the budgetary process.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Instead, it is a shift to competitive procurement as required by the State&rsquo;s legal obligations and the principles of good governance.</p>  <p>  The procurement of a Local Area Employment Service is being done over two phases.  The tendering process for the first phase, covering seven counties where no Local Employment Services existed, is complete, with contracts awarded and services being mobilised.  Phase two has commenced with the publication in December of a request for tenders for the remaining 19 counties over 17 contract lots. Services are expected to commence in July.  </p>  <p>  Once the procurement process is complete, the State will have established a quality employment service designed to engage with those farthest from the labour market in every county in the State.  By contrast, the existing LES services covers just eight counties, with partial coverage in four more and no service in fourteen counties across the State. </p>  <p>  The possibility of retaining the current LES model and doing nothing was not an option.  My Department has received clear legal advice from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General that this process is not in keeping with our procurement obligations and there needs to be competitive procurement for future public employment services.  In addition, my Department is responsible for ensuring good governance of employment service provision, which requires greater oversight and enhanced visibility of service provision.</p>  <p>  My officials have worked to ensured that the new procurement model minimizes any potential barriers to the community and voluntary sectors or inhibits their ability to submit high quality tenders for future services.  The Local Area Employment Service model prioritises and awards the provision of quality employment services, community linkages and social value.  </p>  <p>  After extensive engagement with stakeholders after phase one, my Department incorporated many improvements into the phase two request for tender, published shortly before Christmas. </p>  <p>  I understand and appreciate the concerns of the sector at the changes proposed.  However, current community and voluntary service providers with a strong track record and an openness to cooperation will be well placed to submit high quality tenders for the new services.  Under Phase 1, community and voluntary sector providers were successful in two of the three lots where they submitted tenders.  My Department will continue to proceed with Phase 2 to ensure that its contracted employment services are procured in manner consistent with the State's legal obligations.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, one in four Jobseeker payments were still paid into customers&rsquo; bank accounts.  These include, for example, those in receipt of a jobseeker payment when they reach the age of 62, who are given options as regards payment method.</p>  <p>  When health restrictions were introduced in 2020, all Jobseekers were given the option of being paid into a bank account.  This was an exceptional temporary measure to help reduce the spread of the virus and to ensure that people could comply with social distancing guidelines.  This was the right approach to take at the time when we were faced with the worst of Covid-19 without having any vaccines and with only limited knowledge of the virus.</p>  <p>  In line with the general easing of Covid-19 restrictions, I have asked my Department to revert to the normal payment rules for Jobseekers&rsquo; payments.  I believe this is the right approach to take in terms of supporting the post office network, a key piece of the financial and social infrastructure of the country, in ensuring that, with the removal of restrictions, we return to the pre-pandemic position.</p>  <p>  This change will initially apply to new claims.  Over the coming months, my Department will work to extend the post office requirement to other jobseeker claims.</p>  <p>  Retail has reopened nationally and is operating safely.  The post office network has remained open throughout the pandemic and has processed approximately 45 million social welfare payments over the last two years.  Post offices have been equipped with fixed sanitiser units so that customers can sanitise their hands and have clearly marked signs to assist with social distancing and staff operate behind transparent screens.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some people who are immuno-compromised may want to avoid crowded settings.  If a person is in this situation, the advice is to contact the nearest Department of Social Protection office.  My officials there will offer help so that these people may still be able to receive their payment online in exceptional circumstances.</p></reply>

The baseline year will be maintained at 7 years behind the current year going forward i.e. on 1 January 2022, the baseline year moved to 2015. </p><p>The following changes are effective and operational from 1st January, 2022. </p><p>The qualifying age for the CE service support stream (SSS) has been reduced from 62 to 60 and the 10% cap on the number of participants has been removed.  This means that persons over 60 years of age can now remain on CE until they reach the state pension age, once there are places available. </p><p>Participants on RSS who are 60 years of age or older can also now remain on the programme until they reach the state pension age &ndash; this directly benefits those participants who started RSS since the introduction of the six-year rule in 2017. </p><p>In order to assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports over the next period, participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, until a suitable replacement has been referred to the scheme.  This transitionary provision will support schemes to retain services, with the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022, as participants with extended contracts start to leave schemes.  This was also effective from 1st January 2022.  Any extension of participants' contracts under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the impact of COVID on the recruitment of participants and services provided by the scheme, along with recruitment and referral efforts. </p><p>While it is too early to say definitively, feedback received to date in relation to these changes is positive and it is expected that these will have a positive impact at individual CE scheme level over the coming months. </p><p>In light of the need to re-impose some public health restrictions in December and January, and the impact of these restrictions on schemes, a further extension of contracts for CE &amp;amp; T&uacute;s participants has been approved.  CE and T&uacute;s participants with extended contracts will not now begin to leave schemes until 8th April and will exit schemes in a phased manner over the following twelve months.  </p><p>Officials from my Department will continue to work with and support all CE schemes throughout the transitionary period as all extended contracts come to an end. </p><p>My priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back providing normal services and supports to their long-term unemployed participants while delivering valuable services to local communities.</p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies </p></reply>

Consultations with a CWO are available via phone, at our offices and if the need arises a direct home visit appointment can be arranged depending on the customer&rsquo;s need and public health restrictions.  All applications for assistance are dealt with promptly by my officials.  </p><p>It is important to note that as part of my continued commitment to improve the Community Welfare Service in County Monaghan and across the country, customers no longer have to meet in person with a Community Welfare Officer to make a claim.  This change is a significant enhancement to the service offered to customers as it means, for instance, that those who require community welfare assistance in Ballybay or any other location in County Monaghan no longer need to visit an outreach location or wait to make a claim or wait to access the service.  </p><p>These initiatives that I have put in place continue to ensure that the service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The contracts describe the employment service to be delivered, the duration of the contract and the funding available for delivery.  EmployAbility contracts run from the 1 January to the 31 December each year.  </p>  <p>  My Department has agreed contracts with 23 EmployAbility service providers, including Mayo EmployAbility Service, for the provision of services for 2022, based on a bid proposal that is balanced against both the level of service required by the Department and the available funding.  The EmployAbility Service provides support to people with disabilities to secure and maintain paid employment in the open labour market leading to independence and career progression.  It is a nationwide service and is delivered under contract on behalf of my Department.  The total value of the contracts for 2022 is &euro;10.6m.</p>  <p>  On entering into an EmployAbility contract, an organisation understands and accepts that the contract is time limited and has a limited contract value.  A 'contract of service' requires the contractor to provide, and accept responsibility for, all aspects of the service delivery, including the provision of staff.  However, the terms and conditions of those staff, which may already be in existence, is solely a matter for the organisations employing them. In respect of Mayo EmployAbility Service and staff increments, this is a matter for the EmployAbility Service provider as the employer. </p>  <p>  The contract value for a particular contract is established based on the previous level of funding and service level provided under previous contracts.  In general, any increases within any subhead area is only considered where there are proposals for increased service provision and performance, and where the overall EmployAbility Service Budget allows for such an increase.  My Department evaluates the proposal, based on both proposed and previous service level and contract values.  Once evaluated the proposed contract agreement is issued to the provider with the Department's assessment of the contract valuation for the relevant provider and it is then the decision of the service provider to sign the relevant agreement confirming that they accept the contract value as offered. </p>  <p>  My Department recognises and values the expertise and dedication of the EmployAbility staff in the delivery of an efficient and committed EmployAbility service.

The existing Job Club providers in Laois/Offaly did not submit a tender for these counties, removing any possibility of them continuing to provide employment services in the area after the end of 2021.  Nonetheless, the outcome of this open and transparent procurement process was not contested by any parties.</p>  <p>  On 15 December 2021, the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) wrote to my Department regarding specific industrial action in Job Clubs in Offaly and Laois.  The WRC is a forum for resolving employment issues that arise between an employer and its staff.</p>  <p>  All my Department's employment service contracts are unequivocal in stating that the Department of Social Protection is not an employer of its service partners' staff.  This is clearly stated in the relevant Job Club contracts for Laois/Offaly.  The Department of Social Protection is not the employer of the staff concerned nor is it a party to an employment dispute with any of its service partners or their staff.  It would therefore be inappropriate for it to engage in talks at the WRC.  Nonetheless, the Department has offered to provide any information or clarifications that could assist the WRC in their efforts. </p>  <p>  In relation to the former Job Club staff in Laois/Offaly, I understand that they have all been offered employment by Turas Nua on their existing terms and conditions.  I also understand that earlier this month, the staff commenced training with Turas Nua to provide services under the new Local Area Employment Service contracts.  SIPTU and Turas Nua are continuing to engage regularly, with SIPTU representatives accompanying staff in their recent meetings with Turas Nua.</p></reply>

It was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model of pension rate calculation and migrating from the yearly averaging model on a phased basis over 10 years rather than in a single step.</p>  <p>  There is a chapter on TCA in the Commission&rsquo;s Report which includes a section covering Gender, Equality and Poverty Proofing.  The report states that a TCA arrangement results in a fairer and a more transparent system, as the person&rsquo;s lifetime contribution is reflected in the State Pension (Contributory) benefit received.  One of the purposes of the full move to TCA and the abolition of the Yearly Average approach is to address the anomalies that arise with the Yearly Average approach, whereby people with fewer contributions can access a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory) payment.  Moving fully to a TCA arrangement would remove these anomalies.  In addition, the report notes that the State Pension (Non-Contributory) and the Increase for Qualified Adult (IQA) payment will continue to provide a safety net to pensioners with limited means. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands. That Committee published its views yesterday.  I and my officials will obviously include these in our deliberations over the coming weeks.  Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system. </p>  <p>  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work and get those views before reaching conclusions.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The total cost of these interventions is projected at &euro;146m in 2022.  These supports were selected to counteract the impact of the increased carbon tax on low income households. The specific measures are:</p>  <p>  i.An increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children aged 12 and over. </p>  <p>  ii.An increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week. </p>  <p>  iii.An increase in the income threshold of the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week. </p>  <p>  iv.An increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week. </p>  <p>In Budget 202  2 I also announced further easing of the qualifying criteria for Fuel Allowance with the allowable means increased by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the relevant State Pension Contributory rate.  The eligibility for Jobseeker&rsquo;s and Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients was enhanced by reducing the qualifying period from 15 to 12 months with effect from September 2022.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides discretionary exceptional needs payments, where appropriate, to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  These payments are not ring-fenced or budget limited as they would be if they were drawn from an earmarked fund, but rather are demand led.</p>  <p>  The provision of any additional supports above those announced on Budget Day would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  The recently announced Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;100 each from the new scheme.  Primary and secondary legislation will be required and it is expected that payments will begin in Quarter 1 2022.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, Minister Humphreys and I have taken a number of measures to support CE schemes and participants during the course of the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  In particular CE participants contracts were extended on a number of occasions.  These contract extensions which are in place since October 2020, supported CE schemes at various stages of the pandemic so that they could maintain important community services.  These contract extensions also ensured that participants had sufficient time to fully avail of the work experience and training opportunities affected by public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to reintroduce some public health restrictions during December and January, I can confirm that CE &amp;amp; T&uacute;s participants contracts are being extended for a further eight weeks.  CE and T&uacute;s participants will not now begin to leave schemes until after after 8th April.  Participants with extended contacts will leave schemes in a phased coordinated manner over the following twelve months.</p>  <p>  In a further change intended to assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports over the next period, participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not yet been referred to the scheme.  This transitionary provision will support schemes to retain services, with the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022.  Any extension under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the impact of COVID on the recruitment of participants, services provided by schemes, along with recruitment and referral efforts.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will continue to work with and support all CE schemes throughout the transitionary period as the extended contracts come to an end. </p>  <p>  My priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back providing normal services and supports to their long-term unemployed participants while delivering valuable services to local communities.  </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  To satisfy the household composition criteria an applicant may live alone or only with:</p>  <p>  -  a qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren); (if the qualified spouse is in receipt of half rate carers, in addition to the IQA payment, they may qualify for fuel allowance, subject to a means test) or</p>  <p>  -  a person in receipt of a qualifying payment who would be entitled to the allowance in their own right or</p>  <p>  -  a person who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit in respect of providing full-time care and attention to the fuel allowance applicant or their qualified spouse / civil partner / cohabitant or qualified child(ren) or</p>  <p>  -  a person receiving pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), a person receiving short-term jobseeker's allowance (JA) or basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) - i.e., less than 391 days for JA and less than 15 months/456 days for SWA).</p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is not payable if an applicant lives with any person, including a family member who is not covered by the criteria outlined.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for Fuel Allowance in the manner outlined by the Deputy would change the targeted nature of the scheme and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department endeavors to ensure that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  </p><p>Significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, average appeal processing times have generally improved between 2018 and 2021 from 30.0 weeks for an oral hearing in 2018 to 25.5 weeks in 2021, and from 24.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2018 to 13.9 weeks in 2021.  Further improvements in appeals processing times is a priority for the Chief Appeals Officer.</p><p>Currently, the number of Appeals Officers (full-time equivalent) is 40 which is similar to the position over the last two years.  A number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months to replace staff leaving on retirement and for other reasons.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it can take some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise.</p><p>The desire to process appeals quickly has to be balanced with the competing demand to ensure that decisions are consistent and of high quality and made in accordance with the legislative provisions and the general principles of fair procedures and natural justice. </p><p>Where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from the Department. </p><p>The processing times for appeals for 2020 and 2021 are contained in the table below. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals Processing Times 2020-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Summary decision (weeks)</th>       <th>Oral hearing (weeks)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>15.5</td>       <td>27.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>13.9</td>       <td>25.5</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test.

(The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120.  This represents a 20% increase and enables more people to qualify for this support).</p>  <p>  -  Increase to the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week.  The Living Alone Allowance is an additional payment made each week to people aged 66 years or over who are living alone and in receipt of certain payments, including Disability Allowance and Blind Pension.  </p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has announced a wide range of measures to support the arts.  Most recently, this has included the launch of funding of &euro;6.6 million for the 2022 Creative Ireland Programme - Creative Communities initiative.  This partnership between the department and all 31 local authorities will offer thousands of opportunities across Ireland for people of all ages to engage with creative projects in their local area.  In 2021 this enabled local authorities to deliver nearly 1,500 community-led creative projects.  This funding has proved to be an important flexible resource that has enabled local authorities to sustain and develop vibrant creative communities.</p></reply>

This upper limit will increase to &euro;375 from June 2022. </p>  <p>  The Department's Intreo Service is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports in the State.  Intreo provides supports and services to both jobseekers and employers.  Jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, will gain assistance from case officers in accessing work and training.  </p>  <p>  The contracted Local Employment Services (LES) also deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers, including those with disabilities, who avail of the services.  </p>  <p>  The Department recognises the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and so contracts for the provision of services to help address these.  Access to the service providers Employability is through referral from an Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  </p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme allows a person who has been in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit and who may not have full capacity for work, to enter or return to employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment.  PCB has been designed so there are no restrictions or limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme allows recipients to retain a percentage of their social welfare payment for up to 2 years.  Persons in receipt of a wide range of income supports, including Disability Allowance and Blind Pension, are eligible for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Department contracts the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring and GetAhead Programmes on its behalf.  These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.    </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is a financial incentive targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of a wage subsidy.  The rate of subsidy, increased in Budget 2022, now starts at &euro;6.30 per hour and the amount of the subsidy is based on the number of hours worked. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides the Reasonable Accommodation Fund.  The fund is comprised of four individual grants.  The grants are available towards costs associated with retaining or attracting people with disabilities into the workplace.  They cover a number of items such as workplace and equipment adaptation, occupational capacity and workplace job assessments, training, sign language interpreter or other interpreters and personal readers.  There is also funding available for disability awareness training in the private sector.</p>  <p>  Finally in addition to the increase in the earnings disregards, I introduced a suite of measures designed to support people with disabilities as follows:</p>  <p>  -  An increase to the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5.10 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means.</p>  <p>  -  An increase to the WSS base subsidy, from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour.  The new rate is a substantial contribution to the employer&rsquo;s wage costs.  In situations where an employer employs between 3 and 6 employees, a 10% top-up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;6.93 for each employee.  In the case of an employer who has more than 23 employees the payment rate will be &euro;9.45 per hour for each employee.</p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to supporting households to control and meet energy costs through a combination of monetary supports as well as investment to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock.</p>  <p>  The Household Benefits package (HHB) is just one of a range of supports my Department provides to assist people with their fuel costs.  Any decision to enhance the HHB package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance payment is a means tested payment and the criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the payment to those households who need it most.  It is for this reason that the Government in recent Budgets has directed resources to this scheme rather than the HHB package.</p>  <p>  As part of the overall welfare budget package of &euro;600m in increases I secured for 2022, I was pleased to be able to increase the Fuel Allowance payment by &euro;5 per week and the weekly income threshold for it by &euro;20 effective from Budget night.</p>  <p>  Other payments such as increases for qualified children, the living alone allowance and the working family payment are also shown to be effective in supporting those households who will be most challenged by increases in energy costs.  Again I was pleased to be able to bring forward increases in these payments, valued at &euro;98m in a full year, as part of Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  The recently announced Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent unprecedented rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;100 each from the new scheme.  Primary and secondary legislation will be required and it is expected that payments will begin in Quarter 1 2022. </p>  <p>  In addition to the regular weekly and monthly payments, the Department can also support people through the use of discretionary payments including through the Exceptional Needs Payment and through a special heating supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for 10,000 jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP). Participation on WPEP is entirely voluntary.

This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s clear commitment to workers who lost employment during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  There has been a significant reduction in the number of recipients who are in receipt of the PUP from a peak of 605,000 in May 2020, over 481,000 in February 2021 to approximately 75,500 this week.  Following the recent Government decision to remove restrictions with effect from 22 January we expect many more thousands of workers to return to work. </p>  <p>  As a result of the lifting of restrictions, PUP has been closed to new applications and the Government has approved the winding-down of the scheme over the coming months.  The process of moving recipients to standard social welfare terms on a gradual basis, which had commenced from September 2021, will continue.  From 8 March 2022, anyone in receipt of PUP whose rate was higher than &euro;208 will move to the standard weekly rate of &euro;208.  Remaining recipients will then commence transitioning to standard social welfare terms, and if eligible, will move onto a jobseeker payment from 5 April 2022.</p>  <p>  It is important in the interest of fairness and equity that standard social welfare standards are restored as the need for this emergency support diminishes, and therefore I have no plans to reverse these decisions.  Where customers are unable to return to employment, supports are available from my Department&rsquo;s Public Employments Service to assist them to find employment or retrain. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022 Government committed to very significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports.  These include an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12 and &euro;3 per week for children over 12, an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3 per week, an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 per week combined with a broadening of the threshold for eligibility and an increase in the income threshold of the Working Family Payment of &euro;10 per week.  The total cost of these interventions is projected at &euro;146m in 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, I provided for a &euro;5 weekly increase on standard weekly social welfare rates.  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources.</p></reply>

Latest available figures from the CSO suggest that Government&rsquo;s pandemic related supports &ndash; the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Temporary/Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (T/EWSS) &ndash; have, in total, supported over 1.4 million people since their introduction in March 2020.</p>  <p>  Since the later half of 2021 however, Ireland&rsquo;s labour market and economy has seen a sharp recovery as public health restrictions have eased, businesses reopened, and people returned to work.  Employment figures from the CSO up to end-September 2021 suggest that the number of people employed in Ireland had in fact increased from pre-COVID-19 levels.  In line with these positive developments, the number of people dependent on pandemic supports, particularly the PUP, have declined considerably.  Recent analysis published by my Department showed that at least 73 percent of former PUP recipients were back in work as of mid-September 2021.</p>  <p>  Latest figures from my Department indicate that 75,413 are currently in receipt of the PUP, approximately 22,000 of whom entered following the latest restrictions in early December.  However, I expect the vast majority of these individuals to quickly return to employment following the Government&rsquo;s recent decision to remove the majority of remaining public health restrictions.  Moreover, in line with the easing of these restrictions, PUP is now closed to new entrants and the remaining PUP recipients will gradually transition to the jobseeker terms in the coming months.</p>  <p>  While overall dependence on COVID-19 supports has declined hugely, I am acutely aware that there will be a significant number of people who will have permanently lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.  It is also important that we do not forget those who were unemployed prior to COVID-19 and those facing higher barriers to employment.  All these people will need intensive support to help them regain their footing in the labour market and return to work.</p>  <p>  It was with this core objective in mind that Pathways to Work 2021&ndash;2025 &ndash; the Government&rsquo;s new employment services strategy &ndash;was published in July 2021.  It set out provisions to expand the caseload capacity of the Intreo Public Employment Service, through a 50 percent increase in the number of Intreo Case Officers. </p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work, my Department also introduced a series of employment supports to help individuals return to employment, to reskill and to find new jobs.  These include:</p>  <p>  -  A new paid Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6 month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, to provide 10,000 unemployed people with the opportunity to gain valuable on-the-job experience.</p>  <p>  -  Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers.</p>  <p>  -  Funding 50,000 additional places in further and higher education, including via Skills to Compete, Skillnet Ireland, Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative.</p>  <p>  -  Increased funding for the Back to Education scheme which leads to second and third level qualifications, with a target of increasing participation in education programmes to 7,700.</p>  <p>  -  The provision of an extra 3,000 places on State Employment Schemes, including Community Employment, to support long term unemployed people, get back to work.</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the maximum value of the Training Support Grant available via Intreo from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 to help over 12,500 jobseekers per annum access relevant and accredited training programmes.</p>  <p>  While the Pathways to Work strategy is still in its early stages of implementation and COVID-19 related supports still being gradually unwound, I am confident that my Department and Intreo have the necessary resources and programme capacity to support all those in need of support re-enter the workforce.  In doing so, we will further reduce dependency on State supports, while maintaining welfare support for those that need it most.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 and with immediate effect the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension representing a 20% increase and enabling more people to qualify for this support.  The &euro;120 allowable means limit is significantly more than the &euro;33 weekly rate of fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Further changes to the fuel allowance scheme in Budget 2022 included increasing the weekly rate of fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week with immediate effect, and with effect from September 2022 the reduction of the qualifying period for Jobseeker&rsquo;s and Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients from 15 to 12 months.</p>  <p>  The Government has, therefore, implemented significant improvements through Budget 2022.

Under the scheme farmers can receive the equivalent of a jobseeker payment and also have access to secondary benefits and employment services.  The 2022 Revised Estimate provides for expenditure of &euro;53.9 million on the scheme which is currently supporting just over 4,900 farmers.</p>  <p>The means test for the Farm Assist scheme is more generous than that for the Jobseeker Allowance scheme.  Payments received under the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme (NPWS) and the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) attract a disregard of &euro;2,540, with 50% of the balance assessed as means. </p>  <p>  However, I am very conscious of the importance of sustaining farming activity and supporting farming households in rural communities.  Accordingly, the Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 to review the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist.  As part of this review process it was recommended to provide for an extensive expansion to the list of Agri-Environmental schemes which will qualify towards the disregard of &euro;2,540.  I am delighted that the Social Welfare Act 2022, which enacts Budget 2022 measures, has extended the list of schemes to which this measure applies.  Furthermore, this extension was originally due to take effect from October 2022 but will now be implemented from June.  It will support the Government&rsquo;s climate change agenda and act as an incentive to farmers to participate in the schemes. </p>  <p>  I am considering the review in full and will arrange to finalise it in due course. </p></reply>

As I have previously advised the Deputy, I will be working with Minister O&rsquo;Gorman to see how best we can do this.</p>  <p>  Within the social welfare system, there are a number of supports for people who suffer a bereavement.  In particular, there is an arrangement known as the six-weeks payment after death which allows for certain payments to continue to be made after a person dies.</p>  <p>  If a person is in receipt of a primary social welfare payment which includes an increase for a qualified child and, tragically, that child dies, the qualified child payment will continue for six weeks after the child's death.  In cases where an individual has been in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment and an increase for a qualified child, both payments will continue for six weeks after the death of that child.</p>  <p>  In the case of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, payment continues to be made for twelve weeks after the death of the person who was being cared for, including where this was a child.  Carer&rsquo;s Benefit continues for six weeks.  Domiciliary Care Allowance continues to be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend also remain in payment for up to six weeks after the death of a qualifying child.  Eligibility may continue beyond those six weeks if there are other children associated with the claim.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department may make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.  In 2021, approximately 2,400 exceptional needs payments totalling &euro;5.1 million were made in relation to funeral and burial costs.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, &euro;60,000 was allocated to the Irish Hospice Foundation, to carry out a research project into funeral poverty in Ireland, together with the wider economic impact of bereavement.  This project is expected to be completed this Spring. </p></reply>

Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid without a means test where a particular contingency arises.</p>  <p>  Secondly, there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.</p>  <p>  There is also a general principle of 'one person, one payment', which applies across the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally, as these payments are to help them meet their income needs, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  Overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only ten individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients.</p>  <p>  The combined rates of payment if a person was to be paid both a full rate Widow's Contributory Pension and Illness Benefit (plus allowances), neither of which are subject to a means test, would be significantly higher than those paid to other people supported by my Department. </p>  <p>  The rules governing eligibility for the enhanced Illness Benefit payment for people diagnosed with Covid-19 are the same as for the standard Illness Benefit.</p>  <p>  To change the underlying principle of entitlement, and allow people to claim multiple payments would involve significant additional expenditure, which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which an illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. </p><p>In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. </p><p>The rate of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of illness benefit, for a limited period.  The enhanced rate is &euro;350, with additional payments in respect of dependent adults and children.</p><p>From March 2020 this enhanced benefit was payable for up to 2 weeks where a person was isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person had been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Expenditure on this payment was almost &euro;106 million in 2021.</p><p>The duration of payment for those considered a probable risk was reduced to 7 days from 14 January 2022, in line with government guidelines.  From that date, asymptomatic people who are close contacts and who have had their immunity boosted are not required to restrict their movements, therefore Enhanced Illness Benefit will not be paid to these individuals.  If, however, they start showing symptoms they should immediately self-isolate and, in this circumstance, may apply for the enhanced Illness Benefit payment. </p><p>In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.  Illness Benefit is payable for up to two years, depending on satisfying the eligibility conditions. </p><p>In addition to these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.</p><p>My Department keeps the range of income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

No means were assessed against the person concerned at the time of the application.  Claims in payment are subject to periodic review to ensure that there is a continued entitlement to payment.</p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's Allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person; the equivalent for a person who is married, in a civil partnership, or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income. </p>  <p>  In this particular case, a means review was initiated in September 2021.  The outcome of this means review, based on the information available to the deciding officer, determined that the person concerned had assessable means from employment of &euro;215.58 once the current disregard of &euro;665 was applied.  This resulted in a new rate of &euro;58.00 effective 20 January 2022. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified on 17 January 2022 of this outcome, the reason for it and of their right of review and appeal.  To date, the Department has not received a request for a review or an appeal.  My officials will arrange for a review of the decision based on the information provided by the Deputy.  They will notify the person concerned directly of the outcome of the review once it is completed.  It is also open to the person concerned to submit an appeal of the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to be able to announce additional measures which will allow carers to have a higher weekly household income and a higher level of savings, and still qualify for a Carer's Allowance payment.  These measures, which will take effect from June 2022, include an increase in the income disregard from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.  In addition, the amount of capital disregarded in the means test will be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  These significant changes will mean more carers will now qualify for the payment while those in receipt of a reduced payment will also see increases. </p>  <p>  In advance of June 2022, my officials will be reviewing entitlement for those currently on a reduced rate of Carer's Allowance, including the person concerned, to take account of the new budget measures.  Any change will be automatically applied to the Carer's Allowance payment of the person concerned from June 2022.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It will consider and monitor actions required by the various Government Departments on foot of this report on a bi-annual basis. </p>  <p>  All Departments have been asked to consider actions that are currently being implemented and any proposed new actions that they will be undertaking in the context of the findings of the Report.</p>  <p>  From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting that a number of measures were introduced as part of Budget 2022 in relation to people with disabilities and their carers, which will go towards alleviating the financial costs experienced.  These include a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards as well as supports to employers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  I have asked my officials to revisit the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; proposal to take on board the findings in the Cost of Disability research.</p>  <p>  Solutions will require a multi-faceted approach involving measures to support additional income, targeted grants, and better services or supports. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>My colleague, Minister Ryan, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications has the role of reducing energy poverty by implementing measures to improve the energy efficiencies of Irish homes under a number of schemes and I'm certain the Minister, his Department and relevant agencies under its aegis will be able to provide a range of information resources on these initiatives. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension representing a 20% increase in the threshold which enables more people to qualify for this support.  This measure, along with other Budget measures, was widely promoted at Budget time by many media outlets, as well as on Gov.ie and Citizensinformation.ie.  Detailed guidelines on the qualifying criteria for fuel allowance are, of course, available online on the Gov.ie website.  My Department also issued press releases at Budget time which included details of the increased means threshold for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied.  This upper limit will increase to &euro;375 from June 2022. </p>  <p>  The Department's Intreo Service is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports in the State.  Intreo provides supports and services to both jobseekers and employers.  Jobseekers, including jobseekers with disabilities, will gain assistance from case officers in accessing work and training.  </p>  <p>  The contracted Local Employment Services (LES) also deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers, including those with disabilities, who avail of the services.  </p>  <p>  The Department recognises the additional challenges some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and so contracts for the provision of services to help address these.  Access to the service providers Employability is through referral from an Intreo Case Officer or LES Mediator.  Jobseekers work with a job coach who provides pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance.  </p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme allows a person who has been in receipt of Invalidity Pension or Illness Benefit and who may not have full capacity for work, to enter or return to employment and continue to receive a partial or full payment.  PCB has been designed so there are no restrictions or limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme, allows recipients to retain a percentage of their social welfare payment for up to 2 years.  Persons in receipt of a wide range of income supports, including Disability Allowance and Blind Pension, are eligible for the scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Department contracts the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring and GetAhead Programmes on its behalf.  These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.    </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Scheme is a financial incentive targeted at private sector employers and is aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities through the provision of a wage subsidy.  The rate of subsidy starts at &euro;6.30 per hour and the amount of the subsidy is based on the number of hours worked. </p>  <p>  My Department also provides the Reasonable Accommodation Fund.  The fund is comprised of four individual grants.  The grants are available towards costs associated with retaining or attracting people with disabilities into the workplace.  They cover a number of items such as workplace and equipment adaptation, occupational capacity and workplace job assessments, training, sign language interpreter or other interpreters and personal readers.  There is also funding available for disability awareness training in the private sector.</p>  <p>  Finally in addition to the increase in the earnings disregards, I introduced a suite of measures designed to support people with disabilities as follows:</p>  <p>  - An increase to the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5.10 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means.</p>  <p>  - An increase to the WSS base subsidy, from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour.  The new rate is a substantial contribution to the employer&rsquo;s wage costs.  In situations where an employer employs between 3 and 6 employees, a 10% top-up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;6.93 for each employee.  In the case of an employer who has more than 23 employees the payment rate will be &euro;9.45 per hour for each employee.</p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government's Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 is the national policy for poverty reduction and improved social inclusion.  Its key aim is to reduce the level of consistent poverty to 2% or less with an associated  goal to reduce child poverty in Ireland and to ensure that all families have the opportunity to participate fully in society.  It recognises the importance of child related services working in conjunction with income supports in reducing child poverty. </p><p>The most recent data from the 2020 Survey on Income and Living Conditions was published on 17 December 2021.  It shows the consistent poverty rate for children was 8.0%, which is in line with trends in recent years, despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 sets out a number of key measures to reduce this figure significantly. </p><p>The Government will continue to focus on measures aimed at reducing the number of children experiencing poverty.  The Department of Social Protection offers a range of supports to children and families to alleviate poverty.  Recent Budgets have consistently targeted supports on reducing the number of children in poverty and deprivation.  This reflects the Roadmap commitment to continue to target a reduction in poverty among children and families on low incomes as part of the annual budget process.  In line with this approach, Budget 2022 included:</p><p>- an increase of &euro;5 per week to all Working Age payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults  </p><p>- an increase to the weekly qualified child payment by &euro;2 to &euro;40 for children up to age 12, and by &euro;3 to &euro;48 for children aged over 12</p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 per week in the Working Family Payment thresholds for families of all sizes </p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) for older and younger children, accompanied by an increase in the weekly income limit for receipt of BSCFA for a one parent household to match that of a two-parent household. </p><p>This has occurred alongside measures under the Department&rsquo;s remit to support children and families, such as the extension of the Parent&rsquo;s Benefit; the provision of the School Meals programme; and the development and rollout of the Hot School Meals Programme.</p><p>The above-mentioned supports are accompanied by a range of measures delivered across Government, including:</p><p>- prevention and early intervention initiatives and supports for parents through the work of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, including implementation of the First 5 Strategy.</p><p>- the rollout of free GP care to children and the provision of medical cards to families on low incomes under the Department of Health.</p><p>- the continuing delivery of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme by the Department of Education. </p><p>The social impact assessment of Budget 2022, produced by the Department using the ESRI's tax-benefit model, SWITCH, found that the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2022 most positively impacted non-earning parents (both single and couples).  These families would be vulnerable to child poverty.  This research briefing is available under the Social Inclusion publications available on gov.ie.  </p><p>Official poverty data from the 2021 Survey on Income and Living Conditions is expected to be released by the CSO in April 2022 and will provide a more up-to-date picture of poverty levels, including child poverty, in Ireland. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is expected to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  In order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, of up to 18.5 hours per week. </p>  <p>  In addition to income supports, my Department has utilised the Dormant Accounts Fund to support projects that promote training and supports for family carers.  These projects include the provision of structured training, information and support networks including the development of support groups to assist with transition at the end of the caring role.  The projects are selected as part of a competitive process organised by Pobal.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I approved funding of &euro;577,890 to provide a range of training and supports for family carers for projects under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020.  These projects run to the end of June.  The purpose of the measure is to increase the employment, including self-employment, and education and training opportunities for carers and young carers.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in October I announced additional funding of &euro;480,153 to Care Alliance Ireland and Family Carers Ireland under the Dormant Accounts Fund.

On the 23rd December, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit over 2,200 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place.  The ex-gratia payment provides for 2 weeks pay per year of service or part thereof in the qualifying period.  The calculation will be based on the salary point of the CE supervisor or assistant supervisor on the date of retirement, subject to a cap of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The qualifying period for the scheme is from 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2023 and will apply to all periods of employment as a CE supervisor or assistant supervisor during that period. </p>  <p>  The end date of the scheme as set out in the agreement is aligned with the start date of an auto enrolment (AE) pension system, currently in design.  However, any future integration of this scheme with AE will be subject of further discussion with the unions concerned and these discussions will be undertaken when the operation of AE is in place.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection will now work to put in place the administrative arrangements to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified CE workers in 2022.  The intention is to develop an online application facility for this purpose.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Credits are also awarded to workers who take      unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.</p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing a person's Yearly Average.</p>  <p>  - HomeCaring Periods &ndash; HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated      Contribution Method (also known as the Interim Total Contributions Approach) of pension calculation.  </p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. </p>  <p>  Foster parents are entitled to the benefits of the Homemakers Scheme or HomeCaring Periods, on the same basis as other homemakers, and will qualify if the carer is in receipt of Child Benefit.  If the foster parent is not in receipt of Child Benefit s/he can still qualify for the Homemaker&rsquo;s scheme or HomeCaring Periods provided the caring periods are confirmed by TUSLA (these are cases where caring is for a short period of time). </p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if his/her spouse is a State pensioner and has significant household means, his/her most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on his/her personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Significant Government support provided to the Early Years sector throughout the pandemic has, in addition to providing essential stability and sustainability, has also helped ensure that fee increases have been kept to near zero over this period. The most recent data available shows that on average fee increases in the period 2020 to 2021 were 0.39% % for Full Day services, 0.15% for Part-time services and 0.41% for sessional services.</p>  <p>  A recently-published Expert Group report on a new funding model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) provided the basis for the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022, including a new Core Funding stream. </p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate from September 2022 and will consist of a supply-side payment to providers to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability.  Core Funding will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207 million from 2023. </p>  <p>  It will require a commitment from providers not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates.  Fixing fees will ensure that parents feel the affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme.  </p>  <p>  The calculation of the value of Core Funding to an individual provider will be predominantly based on the level of capacity that they commit to offering during the contract period, meaning providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, a range of measures have been put in place to ensure that additional costs have not been passed on to parents and these have been largely successful.  Most notably, ELC and SAC employers benefit from an exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will operate until April 2022. </p>  <p>  Between the end of EWSS to the start of Core Funding in September 2022, a Transition Fund will be available to providers.  This is also contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  Communications issued to providers following the Budget about Core Funding and the Transition Fund.  Further extensive communications will issue to the sector to give further details on the new funding streams.</p></reply>

The model seeks to allow groups in a community setting to support refugees arriving in a Community Sponsorship Group (CSG).  </p>  <p>  The Community Sponsorship Ireland model began as a pilot scheme in December 2018.  Following this successful pilot, the Government launched the initiative nationally as a mainstream programme in 2019.</p>  <p>  Since then, 20 families have settled across 20 different rural and urban communities throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  A further 36 Community Sponsorship groups are at various stages of development across 14 counties. </p>  <p>  At the start of 2021, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) commissioned four Regional Support Organisations (RSOs).  They have the role to oversee the recruitment, support, coordination and training of Community Sponsorship groups across 7 regions throughout Ireland and to promote Community Sponsorship at a local level. </p>  <p>  The formation of Community Sponsorship groups has been somewhat delayed by Covid-19.  As the effects of the pandemic lessen and normal interactions begin throughout the country, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) will be in a position to work more intensively with Regional Support Organisations and communities who wish to welcome refugees.  The IRPP is currently working with communities and with Regional Support Organisations to use Community Sponsorship as an important means to support Afghan refugees, including judges, who have come to Ireland since August 2021.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt that Community Sponsorship will continue to be an important strand in the resettlement of refugees and in their integration into Irish life and culture.</p></reply>

I initiated a pre-JLC process in December 2020 and I was happy to see this result in an Establishment Order being signed  by Minister English which came into effect in July and JLC members being appointed in November.  This JLC is now meeting and considering the issues.</p><p>As part of estimates process for Budget 2022, I engaged extensively with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the package of measures for this year.  A major new development for the early learning and childcare sector announced as part of the budget was the introduction of a new Core Funding stream, specifically designed to support the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order by the JLC, along with affordability for parents and sustainability for services. </p><p>Investing in Core Funding to support the JLC process was also part of the recommendations of an Expert Group on a new funding model for the sector, <i>Partnership for the Public Good </i>published in December. </p><p>&euro;69 million has been allocated for Core Funding to operate from September 2022.  This is equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year and is a very substantial additional investment in the sector. </p><p>The precise implications of the funding for staff terms and conditions depends on the agreement by the JLC. However, I believe that the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay and the development of career frameworks which are fundamental to improving quality in the sector and supporting the retention and progression of staff.</p></reply>

Provision has been made in Budget 2022 to further increase this entitlement from five weeks to seven weeks for eligible parents from July 2022. </p><p>Parent&rsquo;s leave was introduced with a view to the transposition of EU Directive 2019/1158, which provides that Member States must provide for a minimum period of two months' parental leave for each parent which cannot be transferred. The intention behind the principle of non-transferable leave in the Directive is to encourage fathers to make use of their right to such leave. It also facilitates the reintegration of mothers in the labour market after they have taken maternity and parental leave. This is further supported through the provision of Parents&rsquo; Benefit.</p><p>It is important to note that the entitlement under the 2019 Act is for each parent in their own right and is not an allocation per family. The Act was drafted in such a way as to take account of the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent. In effect this means that more than two individuals could have an entitlement to the leave.</p><p>There are currently no plans to amend the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 to provide for an additional entitlement for lone parents as it would impact on the intention of this leave.  However, I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by lone parents and will examine where additional supports could be provided to them.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022, published in November 2019, is the primary policy vehicle to achieve this vision.</p>  <p>  The Strategy pursues objectives under four thematic pillars providing a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible and included, treated equally, healthy and feel safe and supported. With a view to making progress towards these high-level objectives, it contains over 100 actions.</p>  <p>  To offset delays in the strategies implementation due to the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I extended its lifetime into 2022.  It will be reviewed as part of the process of developing a successor strategy.</p>  <p>The LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy arose from the National Youth Strategy, which was published in 2015. This broader youth strategy identified LGBTI+ young people as a specific group to be considered in the context of focused provision for marginalised and disadvantaged young people. Following this, the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy was published in June 2018. As with the Inclusion strategy, its lifetime was extended into 2021 to off-set delays in its implementation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the strategy is now underway and the subsequent report will be available in due course.  </p></reply>

Almost one year ago, I published a <i>White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service</i>setting out how we intend to achieve this. I am pleased to provide the House with an update on our progress so far. </p><p><b>Accommodation</b></p><p>Under the new system set out in the White Paper, international protection applicants will no longer spend long periods living in congregated settings. Instead, following an initial four month stay in a Reception and Integration Centre, they will move to independent accommodation &ndash; in the White Paper this is referred to as &lsquo;Phase Two accommodation&rsquo; - in houses and apartments in towns and cities across the country. This represents a major change and my Department is taking the necessary steps to put this new accommodation model in place.</p><p>I recently approved an ownership model for this accommodation, under which either Approved Housing Bodies or my Department will be the designated owners of the properties acquired under the new model. </p><p>The City and County Management Association has developed and approved a Local Authority allocation key. This key provides for a distribution of Phase Two accommodation across the country and is assisting this Department and the Housing Agency in identifying suitable properties for purchase for Phase Two accommodation.  </p><p>Again working with the Housing Agency, my Department has recently begun to acquire Phase Two accommodation. I am pleased to say that, under our current rate of progress, we plan to have some of this accommodation ready for applicants to move into later this year.  Draft criteria for selecting applicants to move into this accommodation have been presented to the Programme Board for consideration. </p><p><b>Integration</b></p><p>With respect to integration, the House will be aware that the White Paper commits to the principle of 'integration from day one' for all international protection applicants. To this end, my Department is currently developing an Integration Programme. In collaboration with the Local Authorities, we are designing the supports that will be needed at a local level, and the structures required to co-ordinate and deliver them. This will expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection.</p><p>A key enabler for applicants to move into the community and live independently will be the availability of an income support payment. A detailed policy paper for this payment has been drafted and the focus is now on establishing the structures to put the income support payment in place.</p><p><b>Implementation and Monitoring</b></p><p>I have appointed a Programme Board to oversee the transition to the new model. Membership of this board includes officials from relevant Government Departments and agencies, a representative with lived experience of International Protection, representatives of non-governmental organisations working in the area of asylum seeker and refugee integration, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and independent experts in housing and change management. To date, the Board has met on five occasions and its next meeting is scheduled for 17th February.</p><p>A three-person External Advisory Group (EAG) has also been established which will provide independent oversight of the reform process contained in the White Paper. Its members are Catherine Day, David Donoghue, and Lorcan Sirr. The EAG has met on two occasions to date.  </p><p>A dedicated Transition Team has been established in this Department to drive the implementation of the reforms set out in the White Paper. Ending Direct Provision and putting in place the new system with its focus on human rights, on not-for-profit delivery, and on integration from day one, requires a whole-of-Government approach. The Transition Team is therefore working closely with key stakeholders across Government to plan, design, and implement the changes described in the White Paper. </p><p>The Transition Team is currently developing a detailed implementation plan. This plan sets out the approach that will be taken to ensure that the new system of international protection is in place by 2024. Currently inputs to this plan are being sought from other key stakeholders who have responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants.</p><p>Recommendations of <i>Report of the Advisory Group on the Provision of Support including Accommodation to Persons in the International Protection Process</i>helped to inform the development of the White Paper and served as the basis from which we are building the new model.</p></reply>

The second  reduction was in 2018 whereby the number of points at which a child could become eligible for ECCE was reduced down to one (September) and the age of eligibility was further reduced. </p>  <p>  A child must now have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year). This has allowed children to avail of a full two years of ECCE. This change was based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. This has now allowed children to avail of a full two years of ECCE.</p>  <p>  There is no situation in which a child is only entitled to one year of ECCE and the current arrangements ensure that all children have the same entitlement, unlike the 3 entry point system. It should also be noted that whilst there is one point at which the child becomes eligible, they can enter ECCE at any time during the 2 year cycle.</p>  <p>I would note that my Department will commence a 12 month review of ECCE this year which will consider whether ECCE is meeting its objectives and subject to the findings consider whether any changes need to be made.

A further &euro;2.2m was secured in capital carryover bringing total capital funding available to &euro;10.5m in 2021. The upgrading of the fire safety measures in existing early learning and childcare services was the key objective of the 2021 Capital Programme, with &euro;10.5 million available funding.</p>  <p>  The first tranche of capital grants were assigned in May 2021 to existing services to improving fire safety standards.

Eligible expenditure included shelters and play equipment.  Outdoor play enables children to explore and engage with the natural world, while being a simple and effective method of infection control. </p>  <p>  During 2021, my Department successfully secured &euro;70m in the revised National Development Plan (NDP) allocation.

This will include setting eligibility criteria, designing and developing the application process, and establishing approval criteria. This 2022 allocation is for Childminding and Parent and Toddler Groups, who maintain 2021 allocations.

There are 30 CCC, located nationwide, who are funded by my Department to provide support and guidance to local early learning and childcare providers and to familes accessing these services.  </p>  <p>  In 'First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families', my Department committed to completing a comprehensive review of the operating model for ELC and SAC. The work of CCC was in scope of this review, in addition to the work of other organisations in the operating model.</p>  <p>  The ELC and SAC sector in Ireland has grown substantially in the past decade. The objective of the Review is to ensure that the operating model is fit for purpose to implement policy relating early learning and childcare to the scale and standards required in an evolving and expanding sector, with the citizens of Ireland at its heart as core beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  An independent external contractor has been engaged by my Department to undertake an assessment of the current operating mode and to identify options for  reform.  An Oversight Group, chaired by my Department, was also established and met regularly throughout the process. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that this Review has concluded and a report on the Review is being finalised.

Children&rsquo;s First Guidance 2017 includes information on the statutory obligations for those individuals and organisations under the Act. It also sets out the best practice procedures that should be in place for all organisations providing services to children. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory body with responsibility for child protection and welfare services.  If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be vulnerable, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. Referrals to Tusla increased by 8% in 2021. </p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify where a child is listed on the Child Protection Notification System. There is a 24/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.   </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved.</p>  <p>  Where a referral to Tusla outlines a welfare concern, Tusla can respond directly or refer the child and family to a family support services in the locality. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking information on the number of children throughout the country by region who are currently in need of or in receipt of support. I have asked Tusla to consider the Deputy's request from a child welfare and protection perspective and to respond to the Deputy directly as appropriate. </p></reply>

This marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022, including the Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability.  </p>  <p>  Core Funding will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year. It will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme.  </p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, my Department has been aiming to ensure the sustainability of services and prevent the additional costs from public health measures being passed on to parents.  These efforts have been successful and average costs to parents have not increased.  ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) until April 2022. </p>  <p>  From the end of EWSS to the start of Core Funding in September 2022, a Transition Fund will be available to providers.  This is also contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  The introduction of fee control measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, and further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also announced an extension in the age of children who are eligible for the universal NCS subsidy and a change to how 'wraparound hours' for NCS subsidy are determined.  These measures were also recommended by the Expert Group.  </p>  <p>  The fee management system, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver significantly improved affordability for parents.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 began the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.  </p></reply>

The SIT funding includes support workers and assistance for employment and enterprise development. </p><p>Significant funding is provided by my Department to support the work of the Traveller Mediation Service and the Traveller Counselling Service.</p><p>My Department is working to advance projects that increase the visibility of Traveller culture and heritage.  Funding is provided to a number of cultural initiatives including an allocation of &euro;100,000 for Traveller Pride Week<b></b>to empower national, regional and local organisations to celebrate Traveller and Roma culture and diversity. A project is also being progressed with the National Museum of Ireland to develop an online portal to the Traveller Culture collections.  </p><p>My Department supports a number of projects which specifically address the needs of Roma. for example, funding is provided to C&aacute;irde to establish a group of Roma women as peer advocates within their community.  The project aims to provide training, development of skills in literacy, basic computer skills and develop links between participants and relevant services and supports.</p></reply>

In this regard I have also scheduled a meeting with Minister O&rsquo;Brien this month to further this work.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will know, addressing Child Poverty was identified as a priority action under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and it will remain a priority in the successor framework being developed by my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department actively engages with colleagues across government in our efforts to tackle child poverty, and will continue to prioritise family leave, early learning and care, and child centred family support services. </p>  <p>  Of course as Minister for Children, I am committed to contributing in any way I can to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to tackle child poverty, and in Budget 2022 I secured an additional &euro;84m to help address and counter child poverty. This funding is additional to my Department's significant annual spending on youth services and on supports for children and young people, with almost &euro;640m being spent on child care support programmes and almost &euro;900m allocated to Tusla for services to deliver better outcomes for all our children, and particularly for those most at risk and vulnerable.</p>  <p>  I believe that significant advancements can be made through my Department&rsquo;s coordination of the EU Child Guarantee, an important initiative which aims to combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services.   </p>  <p>  I will publish our National Action Plan for the Child Guarantee by March 2022.  The commitments under the Guarantee address critical matters such as free access to early childhood education and care; education; healthcare for children in need; healthy nutrition including a healthy meal each school day; and adequate housing.</p>  <p>  Tackling child poverty and effectively implementing the Child Guarantee will require the commitment and active and sustained participation of my colleagues across government to ensure it is collaborative, integrated and, ultimately, impactful.</p>  <p>  As part of the EU Child Guarantee process, and in developing the successor national policy Framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I will be engaging with my cabinet colleagues to consider the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people. </p>  <p>  In terms of child poverty focused structures, I have an open mind on how best to address this complicated issue though at this time I have no plans to introduce a child poverty unit.  That said, my Department has established a new EU and International Unit which, among other responsibilities, will lead on the coordination across Government of the necessary actions emerging from the EU Child Guarantee. This will enable us to pursue a coherent agenda in relation to child poverty.</p></reply>

It was independently chaired and comprised of national and international experts across multiple fields.  It met 21 times and has now completed its work. </p><p>The report of the Expert Group, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A new Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare</i>, was published on 7 December 2021 following consideration by Government and acceptance of its 25 recommendations. Work has now commenced on implementation of these recommendations. </p><p>Announcements in Budget 2022 signaled the commitment to the first stage of implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. Full implementation of all recommendations will be progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process.</p><p>I was very happy to have had the opportunity to meet the chair of the Expert Group in advance of the Estimates process to allow the emerging recommendations to inform the developments being introduced in Budget 2022. </p><p>In particular, a new Core Funding stream for services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability and the establishment of an Employment Regulation Order, is being introduced and will be worth up to &euro;69 million in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year. Participation in Core Funding will require services not to increase fees to parents above the September 2021 rates.</p><p>A Transition Fund will be also available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the phasing out of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of the new Core Funding stream in September.  Transition Fund will also include the condition that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels.  </p><p>Budget 2022 also announced an extension in the age of children who are eligible for the universal National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidy and a change to how 'wraparound hours' for NCS subsidy are determined.  These measures were also recommended by the Expert Group.  </p><p>The recommendations of the Expert Group are designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff. The report of the Expert Group is available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/report/.</p><p>The new funding model outlined in <i>Partnership for the Public Good</i>comprises four key elements: two new elements (Core Funding and Tackling Disadvantage funding) and two elements which are developments on the existing funding approaches of the ECCE programme and the NCS. </p><p>These four elements, and their associated conditions, will form an interlocking and integrated system of funding which is designed to ensure progress on each of the main goals of ELC and SAC policy, and move in the direction of enhanced public management. </p><p>In order to deliver such significant change, the Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Division within the Department. Officials has been reconfigured and scheme development and ICT planning is underway in collaboration with Pobal in order to put in place the systems and processes for services to apply for Core Funding, calculate allocations, disburse funding and report on funding. </p><p>An impact monitoring element of this approach to funding is also being developed which will capture data on key indicators that it is anticipated will be addressed through the scheme including workforce pay, qualifications, turnover rates, non-contact time etc.</p><p>Progress on the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be reported in the context of the Annual Implementation Report for the <i>First 5</i>whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.</p></reply>

If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency. </p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect, the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. Referrals to Tusla increased by 8% in 2021. </p>  <p>  Tusla has an out of hours emergency number for AGS which provides advice to the AGS based on the circumstances and also can identify where a child is listed on the Child Protection Notification System. There is a 24/7 'out of hours' social work team available in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Cork and on call social workers in other areas. Tusla has a network of emergency foster care placements for children in need of emergency care out of hours.   </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved. </p>  <p>  In April 2021 Tusla published research undertaken by National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG) which examined the actions undertaken by Tusla social workers when AGS transfer custody of a child to their care, following the AGS removing the child under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. </p>  <p>  A total of 452 cases recorded in Tusla&rsquo;s Section 12 database for the period July 1st 2016 to June 30th 2017 were analysed. The findings showed that most of the children were aged 15 to 17 years and there were slightly more boys than girls. The research also showed that the most commonly reported reasons for invoking a Section 12 were: </p>  <p>  - Severe parenting difficulties </p>  <p>  - Parental Alcohol/Drug Abuse </p>  <p>  - Child behaviour difficulties.</p>  <p>  As the data for the report was collected in 2016/2017 many of the findings of the report, and subsequent recommendations, have been addressed through ongoing service development and improvement in Tusla, including, as mentioned, the standardised processes of communication between Tusla and AGS.</p>  <p>  In relation to children in institutions, HIQA inspect all Tusla children's residential centres and the Registration Unit in Tusla inspect and register voluntary and privately run children's residential centres. Reports of inspections are available on the HIQA and Tusla websites. </p></reply>

It is particularly important now that we are developing a successor policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People. </p>  <p>  On Thursday, 27 January I launched a public consultation which will give children and young people, parents, practitioners and others working with children and young people, as well as the wider public, the opportunity to input into the successor framework. This consultation seeks general views on what is going well in children and young people's lives, and what is not going well. I am looking forward to working with my officials to ensure the feedback we receive from the whole of society influences the new policy framework when the consultation closes on Monday, 28 February. </p>  <p>  However, I also recognise that we need to take additional steps to listen to the voices of groups who have not been heard sufficiently in the past. My Department has studied the many consultations undertaken by Government in the recent past to identify cohorts with whom specific consultation will be required. My Department will also make use of existing Government consultations to inform a policy framework which will deliver meaningful change in children and young people's lives. </p>  <p>  The new policy framework will be developed to incorporate the EU Child Guarantee National Action Plan, which I will bring to government shortly. The plan will address a number of critical matters: securing free access to early childhood education and care; education; healthcare for children in need; healthy nutrition; and adequate housing. </p>  <p>  With a strong focus on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and having regard to the government's wellbeing framework, the new framework will be one which can promote social progress and better standards of life and deliver the special care and assistance due to all children, particularly the most vulnerable. </p></reply>

Secondly, I would like to commend our children and young people for the way they have dealt with the impact of the pandemic on their lives. The loss of social outlets during lockdowns has been felt across our society and my Department has put a number of measures in place to aid the recovery of our children and young people from the impacts of the pandemic. </p><p>Given the importance of early learning and childcare for children, their families, and society more broadly, I have put in place a range of supports for the early learning and childcare sector since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>Supports include tailored funding arrangements during periods of closure and restricted access to services, a range of capital programmes, an antigen programme, sector-specific infection prevention and control guidance, and access to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). </p><p>Ensuring that early learning and childcare services can continue to operate safely for children, families and staff, is among the key objectives of these supports.</p><p>While there has been an easing of many restrictions more broadly, the current position is that early learning and childcare services should continue to operate under sector-specific infection prevention and control guidance. This approach is in line with schools and is in effect until 28 February 2022. </p><p>To defray the additional costs associated with this guidance and to ensure these costs were not passed onto parents through higher fees, early learning and childcare providers continue to be eligible to access the EWSS, with an exemption to the turnover rule, which I negotiated for the sector. With the value of EWSS at standard rates since 1 February, estimated to cost &euro;22m per month, the support under EWSS remains in excess of what is required to support the implementation of sector-specific infection prevention and control guidance.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, my Department has been engaging with children and young people to learn about their experience during the pandemic.</p><p>In the summer of 2020, my Department, the Department of Health and the youth sector, collaborated with SpunOut.ie to undertake an online survey of young people&rsquo;s experiences of COVID-19. A Youth Advisory Group worked with officers from my Department to guide the development and analysis of the consultation.</p><p>The consultation asked young people about what has been working well for them and the challenges in maintaining their wellbeing during COVID-19. This engagement by my Department gave young people a chance to provide us with feedback on what could be useful in improving their mental health and wellbeing over the coming months.</p><p>The &lsquo;Supporting Children&rsquo; media campaign which ran from June to September 2020, and for a further six weeks following the increased restrictions at the beginning of 2021, was also created in response to the pandemic and the identification of a need for awareness raising in respect of the systems and supports available to vulnerable children, young people and families. </p><p>The Growing up in Ireland Survey has tracked the outcomes for children before and during the pandemic. The survey showed that many children spent less time with friends and participated in organised activities less during the pandemic.</p><p>Children and Young People Services Committees (CYPSC) have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and have utilised my Department&rsquo;s programme funding to help coordinate initiatives in response to identified needs for children and young people and their families.  Examples of this important work include the delivery of school meals, family educational and activity packs, and food packs to local families. This work is being done in collaboration with local partners in the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary sector, such as the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  This work is ongoing, with CYPSCs continuing to identify and address the needs of disadvantaged communities throughout the pandemic. </p><p>Supporting parents and enabling them to fulfil their roles will be vital as the country recovers from the impacts of the pandemic.</p><p>My Department is currently finalising a national model for parenting supports, which seeks to support all parents to be confident and capable in their parenting role, and to achieve the best outcomes for children and families. The model will be published later this year, and recognises the importance of all persons who play a parenting role in the lives of children and young people. </p><p>Recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic will also be a key focus in the successor framework to <i>Better Outcomes; Brighter Futures,</i>which is currently being developed by my Department.</p></reply>

All were allocated a Social Worker and had a Care Plan. School placements, medical treatment and dental treatment were provided. The young people were enrolled in English language support and had therapeutic supports available to them. </p>  <p>  In addition, the young people had recourse to legal advisors and were supported in their applications for reunification with displaced family members. </p></reply>

It is also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme.  </p><p>- The <b>Income Assessed Subsidy</b>is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. It is means tested and will be calculated based on individual circumstances. Those on the lowest incomes will receive the highest subsidies. </p><p>The NCS is  designed to be flexible and accommodate busy parents&rsquo; lives. The attendance rules for the scheme facilitate the need for flexibility and recognise that, in practical terms, parents are constrained by a range of individual circumstances. </p><p>The Scheme acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across different families. That is why subsidies are offered on an hourly basis. The NCS allows for flexible arrangements to be made depending on the parents&rsquo; needs. </p><p>The Scheme has been designed to be flexible in its application process as well. The online application allows for the parent to complete the process at their own pace, and parents have the option of completing a paper application by post. The system caters for applications from all family types, and no one family type is in any way disadvantaged.</p><p>As part of the monitoring, review and evaluation of the NCS, Frontier Economics was commissioned to undertake a formal review of the first year of the NCS, with the report published in December 2021. The report noted that childcare costs in Ireland have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS was designed to make childcare more affordable and, in some instances, free. In this regard, the report highlights that among claimants of the income-assessed subsidy, around a third were lone parents. It further noted that one parents had a substantially higher mean hourly rate than couples, leading to a substantially higher mean weekly value for claims.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I announced a number of changes to the NCS, which will be of significant benefit to many parents. </p><p>These changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services by extending the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 - benefitting up to 40,000 children. </p><p>A further change will remove the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children.</p><p>Finally,  I would note the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, mentioned above, is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks, and the programme year runs from September to June. A child must have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year). </p></reply>

As part of the <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions</i>, the Government committed to progressing this legislation as a priority. </p><p>My Department gave serious consideration to all possible options, including the question of whether current data protection law is sufficient to allow full unredacted access to birth certificates and birth information in all cases. In December 2020, I received correspondence from the Data Protection Commissioner that dealt with a number of matters, including the Government commitment to advance legislation to provide access to birth certificates and birth information.</p><p>In that correspondence, the Commissioner stated that, in the absence of this bespoke legislation, data protection law is being tasked with striking the balance of rights between the right to identity and the right to privacy and data protection, and that data protection law alone cannot reconcile the conflict between these distinct and separate rights. The Commissioner also confirmed that the right to access data is not absolute.</p><p>My Department has continued to consult the Data Protection Commission (DPC) throughout the process of preparing the legislation and matters raised by that Office have been addressed in the drafting of the Bill.  The Department completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) following the publication of the Heads of Bill which was shared with the DPC.  As is good practice, the DPIA was updated to take account of the development of the Bill. The DPIA was published alongside the Bill and other explanatory material in January 2021, and can be found on my Department's website.  </p><p>The DPC participated in the pre-legislative scrutiny process, appearing twice before the Joint Oireachtas Committee. They signaled their support for the legislation at those appearances, and outlined their engagement with my Department. They also provided a general comment on the draft DPIA as a &quot;considered approach to identifying and mitigating any risks to the personal data of individuals arising from the operation of the Bill's provisions, both in terms of those making requests under the Bill and receiving data, and those other persons and third parties to whom the data might relate&rdquo;. </p></reply>

This pilot is one initiative as part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes has been implemented in a number of countries including Scotland, whereby parents receive a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the Baby Box, informed by the commitments in the First 5 strategy, and these may include safety items, toys to support early development and books.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.  </p>  <p>  This action was delayed by the reassignment of personnel to the Covid response.  The preparation to advance the initiative is now proceeding with the first meeting of the project advisory group held on December 13.  It is envisaged that the pilot rollout will get underway early in 2022.  A key element of the pilot is the evaluation.  It is hoped the pilot evaluation report will be finalised in Q3 of 2022.  Once the learning from the pilot has been considered, the next steps to achieve a national rollout can be agreed.</p></reply>

The strategy focuses on the period of early childhood and takes a joined-up, cross-government approach to supporting babies, young children and their families during their early years. The Programme for Government negotiated in 2020 reaffirmed commitment to First 5 implementation. </p>  <p>  The Strategy sets out four goals, nine objectives, five building blocks and over 160 actions to realise the First 5 vision.  It identifies the First 5 big steps including access to a broader range of options for parents to balance working and caring; a new model of parenting support; new developments in child health; reform of the Early Learning and Care system; and a package of measures to tackle early childhood poverty. </p>  <p>  The Phase 1 Implementation Plan, published in May 2019, covers the first three years of the ten year strategy and identifies key milestones for each action across 2019, 2020 and 2021.  An Implementation Office, supported by an Inter Departmental Group, monitors progress and produces an Annual Implementation Report. </p>  <p>  The implementation structures of the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures framework, including the Advisory Council, provide further support and oversight for implementation. The measurability of the actions committed to, the oversight structures, and the transparent approach to monitoring are described by the Advisory Council as &lsquo;a model for other strategies&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The Annual Implementation Report for 2019 monitored progress on all 305 milestones for 2019, illustrating that 69% of milestones were met by the end of 2019.  By the end of 2020, 90% of 2019 milestones were met.</p>  <p>  The Annual Implementation Report for 2020 is currently being finalised and when published will show continuing and significant progress being made on 2020 milestones, notwithstanding the significant impact of Covid-19 during that year and since.</p>  <p>  Major examples of progress include:</p>  <p>  - the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit to five weeks for each parent</p>  <p>  - the extension of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks for each parent, along with an increase to 12 in the age of eligible child for whom this leave can be taken</p>  <p>  - development and publication of healthy eating guidelines and a children&rsquo;s food pyramid for 1-5 year-old</p>  <p>  - significant progress on a range major reform initiatives in Early Learning and Care related to funding, childminding, workforce development and the operating model</p>  <p>  Clearly the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on progress in 2020 given the significant requirement of the civil and public service to respond to the public health emergency and put in place alternative arrangements across many of the major action areas in the strategy including early learning and childcare services, education and, most obviously, health services. </p>  <p>  Despite this, there are many examples of good progress that have been achieved across Government to realise the vision set out in First 5.  The 2020 Annual Implementation Report will be published in Q1 this year and will outline a full account of year two of implementation. The 2021 Annual Implementation Report will follow in Q3.</p></reply>

The National Centre will stand as a National Memorial in honour of those who were resident in Mother and Baby Homes, County Homes, Industrial Schools, Magdalene Laundries and related institutions.</p><p>This project also provides a basis for several other interdependent initiatives. I believe this project will make a significant contribution in our journey of recognising and learning from the failures of the past, acknowledging the hurt which continues to be felt by survivors, and seeking to rebuild a relationship of trust with those who were so profoundly wronged. </p><p>The Secretary General to the Government has been appointed to lead a cross-Government process to advance work on a National Memorial and Records Centre. This process, which will include engagement with survivors, will develop an overarching vision and proposed approach for the creation of the National Centre. Once this initial work is complete a comprehensive proposal will be brought to Government for approval. </p><p>The National Centre will be designed to include an archive of records relating to institutional trauma, alongside personal accounts of survivors lived experiences, as well as presenting the historical and social context. More generally, my Department has already appointed an Archivist and established a dedicated Information Management Unit to lead on the preservation of, and access to, our records, including the Commission&rsquo;s archive. Enactment of the recently published Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 will also assist to safeguard relevant records.</p><p>In addition to the National Centre, work is being advanced in conjunction with the local authorities to deliver on the commitment to support local memorialisation initiatives across the country. Furthermore, financial support is available from my Department through the Commemorative Grant scheme to support survivor groups in commemorating their experiences in a manner which fits their own specific needs.  </p><p>As we have learned from our consultations, memorialisation is very important to survivors although it can mean many different things to different people.  In recognising this variety of perspectives, further consultation will be undertaken to ensure these developments are informed by those most centrally involved with these experiences.</p></reply>

Following a competitive funding call launched in August 2020, 18 successful projects located throughout Ireland were granted funding totalling almost &euro;2.2 million over the three year period.

The legislation required to establish the Scheme is currently being developed as a matter of priority, with a view to opening the Scheme for applications in 2022.</p><p>My Department has also published two substantial pieces of draft legislation. </p><p>The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 was published on 12 January and passed second stage in the D&aacute;il on 20 January. This landmark legislation will provide a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to their origins.</p><p>Turning to the theme of dignified burial, I have carefully considered the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative report on the General Scheme of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill. The children in Tuam deserve an appropriate burial and I am determined to deliver legislation which achieves this dignity for them and their families.  The Bill is now close to completion. I intend to publish it in the coming weeks and move it through the Houses of Oireachtas as quickly as possible.</p><p>A progress report on implementation of the Action Plan will be published annually and laid before the Houses.  This monitoring will be supplemented by the preparation of quarterly bulletins.  These updates will be published on my Department's website and issued directly to any person who provides their contact information for my Department's dedicated mailing list.</p><p>I am aware of the urgency and sensitivity of this work and it is an absolute priority for myself and the Government.</p></reply>

Recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. </p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early years educators or school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  In December last, I published the Nurturing Skills, the Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022 to 2028. Actions in Nurturing Skills to develop career pathways and promote careers in the sector will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment, to make the sector more attractive to potential workers. </p>  <p>  A key enabler for Nurturing Skills will be the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services. I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher rates of pay that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee.</p>  <p>  I am also committed to supporting providers in responding to current challenges. Over recent weeks, a Sub-Group of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum was convened to discuss immediate staffing pressures resulting from Covid-19 and additional measures that may be needed.</p>  <p>  One proposal which was agreed is a temporary measure that has been in place during December and January specifically to help services respond to Covid-19-related staffing shortages through the temporary employment of students on recognised courses of study who are deemed to have achieved the equivalent of a level 5 qualification in early learning and care.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.500.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300081#WRK04500"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for his question. The transition to independent living for those leaving care is a critical one, and in Ireland these young people are offered a wide range of supports, known as aftercare. Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving the care of the state at 18 years of age. Aftercare services build on and support the work already undertaken by many including foster carers, social workers and residential workers in preparing young people for adulthood. </p>  <p>  The main statutory provisions for aftercare are set out in Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991, subsequently amended by the 2015 Child Care Amendment Act. The statute sets out the eligibility criteria for the aftercare service and imposes a statutory responsibility on the Child and Family Agency, Tusla to carry out an assessment of the needs of an eligible child on attaining the age of 18 years and prepare an aftercare plan. The aftercare plan aims to clearly outline the supports required for the person in their transition to adulthood and independent living and is  developed by the social worker together with the child or young person, who participates in all aspects of the plan and therefore has a voice in decisions affecting them. The plan will outline needs such as education, training, employment, health, wellbeing, accommodation, finance, budgeting, social networks and supports, family access and contact, personal and social issues, and supports needed from other services. </p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18 years of age. The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships, secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.  Aftercare provision currently incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support, delivered through aftercare workers or drop in services.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also important elements of the aftercare service.              </p>  <p>  For children with disabilities the same robust system is in place to support the transition from foster care into adulthood and independent living. However, given the additional challenges of their disability, a Joint Protocol and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been agreed between Tusla and the Health Services Executive which places specific emphasis on both agencies working together to assist in the planning for the young person&rsquo;s transition into adulthood.  The Protocol describes how both Agencies will work together to provide a person-centred pathway to meet the needs of children with a complex disability and their families, and outlines a number of principles guiding the provision of care to these individuals.</p>  <p>  Where independent living is deemed appropriate for young people with disabilities, a plan is put in place for the child to transition with appropriate supports. Where independent living is not deemed suitable it may be more appropriate for the child to remain with their foster carers into adulthood. Planning in partnership with the HSE should take place, as per the protocol, to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangement. As the HSE is not a foster care agency this normally takes the form of a "Home Share" placement with the existing foster carers who have an established bond and caring relationship with the young person.</p></reply>

It was published in December 2021. It provides important evidence of the additional costs that people with a disability face in their day-to-day lives. The Cost of Disability in Ireland report was considered by the NDISSG in December 2021, within 24 hours of publication.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy. As the evidence in the Cost of Disability in Ireland report has implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government approach is required to develop appropriate and timely responses and to ensure that everyday costs are reduced for people with disabilities and their families. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the coordination of this whole-of-government response is being carried out under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS). The NDIS is one of two national policy frameworks through which the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland are progressively realised. In addition to advancing key actions under the NDIS, my Department supports the implementation and monitoring of the NDIS by coordinating the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG). The Group is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D., and is attended by representatives of Departments, Agencies and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  At the next NDISSG, which will take place in March, the Group will discuss the approaches to be adopted to act on the findings and conclusions of the report.  The Group will examine meaningful action to reduce day to day costs for people with disabilities in Ireland. Aligning the findings and recommendations of the Cost of Disability in Ireland report to the NDIS will ensure that recommendations can be properly considered at whole of government level and that progress against actions taken will be monitored by the NDISSG and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  In addition to this approach to future policymaking, the government has taken action in Budget 2022 to respond to the additional costs faced by people with disabilities.  Measures include:</p>  <p>  - A &euro;5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments including people with disabilities and carers, with proportionate increases for qualified adults, with effect from January.</p>  <p>  - A &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over and &euro;2 for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments.</p>  <p>  - An increase in the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 per week.</p>  <p>  - A &euro;25 per week increase to the upper earnings disregard  for Disability Allowance and Blind pension from &euro;350 to &euro;375.</p>  <p>  - An increase to the Wage Subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 an hour, thereby encouraging more employers to employ people with a disability.</p>  <p>  - An increase in the Capital/Savings disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000  </p>  <p>  - An increase in the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p></reply>

This is just under half the total in use at one time. </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2022, my Department published a Request for Tender to procure additional accommodation for singles, couples and families seeking international protection. This tender process is a key plank in the Department&rsquo;s strategy to end reliance on emergency accommodation as wetransition toward a new International Protection Support Service.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the International Protection Support Service Transition Team of my Department is progressing a detailed implementation plan for the new system. This is set out in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service,  which I published in February of last year. </p>  <p>My Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the County and City Management Association (CCMA) on developing the new Accommodation Model and wrap-around services for residents.</p></reply>

This includes children who arrive as part of relocation programmes and children who arrive alone at Irish ports and not as part of relocation efforts.</p>  <p>  While there is an active recruitment programme in place in Tusla for general foster carers, this targeted initiative known as &lsquo;F&aacute;ilte Care&rsquo; aims to: (i) identify and recruit specialist care providers through a targeted campaign; (ii) provide a period of online support for specialist carers recruited in this way in the initial stages of a placement and; (iii) create a pool of specialist carers from which to draw as more SCSIP arrive.</p>  <p>  The first targeted campaign for carers for SCSIP took place in Autumn 2021.

The work of the Committee will help to strengthen the Government&rsquo;s approach to combatting individual and institutional racism and will build on the anti-racism actions included in the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS) and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS). The Committee will also examine international best practice in combatting racism and will benchmark its actions against these standards.</p>  <p>  On 21 April 2021, I was pleased to publish the Anti-Racism Committee&rsquo;s Interim Report, which sets out the Committee&rsquo;s initial ideas and plans for developing the National Action Plan Against Racism. The publication of this Action Plan will fulfil a key commitment within the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  On the same day as the publication of the Interim Report, the Committee launched the public consultation phase of its work, which ran for twelve weeks from 21 April until 14 July. During this phase, the Committee accepted written submissions, conducted an online survey, and held a series of consultation sessions with stakeholders  in order better to understand the nature and different forms of racism that are present in Ireland today.  There were 14 consultation sessions which took place between May and July, and these were attended by approximately 170 people in total.  These sessions addressed different themes such as access to justice; media and new technologies; and others identified by the Committee as being of particular concern in the fight against racism.  I was pleased to see that over 100 written submissions were also made.</p>  <p>  Having completed its public consultation, the Anti-Racism Committee is now engaged in the preparation of the National Action Plan Against Racism. My Department is supporting the Committee in its drafting of the Plan, and the Committee aims to submit it to me shortly, within the next two months.

However, dumping of low-level radioactive waste in the Atlantic was carried out by a number of European countries between 1949 and 1982.    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) carries out an annual programme of radioactivity monitoring in the Irish marine environment.  While the influence of radioactive releases from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s and the Chernobyl accident in 1986 can be seen, there is no evidence of releases from dumping sites having a measurable impact on Irish waters or the coast in the analysis of shore-line samples taken.</p>  <p>  Questions relating to specific threats posed by military activity should be addressed to the Department of Defence.</p></reply>

The Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications has committed to developing a storage policy that supports the 2030 CAP targets with a decision to be published early next year. In combination, the CRU will be reviewing the regulatory treatment of storage, including licensing, charging and market incentives which is to be completed by the end of 2023.    </p>  <p>  EirGrid has reported that a number of battery projects have been contracted via two mechanisms: SEM Capacity Auctions and DS3 Systems Services. These routes offer different but essential services to the power system on the island of Ireland. Planning policy and related guidelines are a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) in the first instance and not one in which I have any direct function. As such, it would ultimately be a matter for the minister of that department to bring battery storage guidelines forward, in consultation with my Department, in the event they are required. To date, there have been no discussions between DECC and the DHLGH on this subject and any decision to engage in such dialogue would arise following a determination of the need for such guidelines.</p></reply>

These schemes are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Grants for listed buildings are available in certain circumstances subject to the scheme eligibility criteria and terms and conditions being met. Detailed information on the grants is available at www.seai.ie.  </p><p>A substantial proportion of buildings in Ireland are classified as traditionally built buildings. These tend to be stone or brick buildings which were designed to be vapour permeable. Generally speaking such buildings would have been constructed before 1940. It is important that the materials and techniques used in energy efficiency upgrades of traditional buildings are suitable for the buildings in question including for use with vapor permeable construction where applicable. For example a stone wall with lime based mortar will need a lime based plaster render to remain vapour permeable. Listed buildings are generally a subset of traditional buildings.</p><p>Central policy responsibility for listed buildings would be a matter for the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH). To support the proper upgrade of traditional buildings a new Guidance Document - &ldquo;Energy Efficiency in Traditional Buildings&rdquo; is being developed by DHLGH. My Department and the SEAI are participating in the steering group overseeing the project. The objective is to finalise the guidance having regard to submissions received in the pubic consultation process with a view to publishing it this year. </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.     I appreciate people's frustration when they are living close to a fibre network owned by a commercial operator, but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 21 January, almost 294,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 11 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary and over 54,400 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.  In County Limerick surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Hospital, pre-works are under way in the Deployment Area of Adare and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Limerick, with over 12,000 premises surveyed, almost 5,000 premises under construction and over 2,500 premises now available to order or pre-order.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Limerick through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 21 January, 454 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. The BCP located at Kildimo GAA Club is approximately 3.2km from the premises referred to and is connected with high speed broadband in advance of the deployment of fibre in the area. BCP&rsquo;s are also installed at Askeaton Community Centre, Caherline Community Centre, Glenmore Community Centre, Coolcappa Community Centre, Cappamore Community Centre, Galbally GAA Club, Glenroe GAA Club, Hospital Herbertstown GAA Club, Patrickswell GAA Club, Shanagolden Education Resource Centre (LCETB), Rathkeale Riverside Training Workshop (LCETB) and Halla &Iacute;de Naofa. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Limerick East Educate Together National School, Gerald Griffin National School, Tinnatarriff National School, Knocknadea National School, Coolcappa National School, Anglesboro National School, Mountcollins National School, Killinure National School, Donoughmore National School, Caherline National School and Scoil Naomh Muire have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers on a competitive basis as entirely commercial and operational matters for them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base. The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the continuing upward trend in international gas prices where we are a price-taker. In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas. In Ireland CRU has indicated that the wholesale cost of generating electricity makes up approximately 40% of the final retail price. Various commentators, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), have stated that several demand and supply factors have contributed to a tightening of the European gas market, including most recently geopolitical tensions. While some of these conditions, for example weather related, can be expected to improve others are more unpredictable. The IEA states that international forward prices as of the beginning of January indicate that the high gas price environment is expected to last into 2022. Prices are expected to decline somewhat in the second half of 2022 on improving supply availability, although remaining well-above historical averages.</p><p>The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy where Government supports are considerable. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. In the nearer term, Government has further responded to the current price crunch by bringing in a suite of measures in Budget 2022 utilising the social welfare system to assist households, including the most vulnerable, with projected funding of &euro;146 million. My own Department has allocated &euro;109 million to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to provide energy efficiency upgrades to people in, or at risk of, energy poverty in 2022. In addition, a &euro;215m Scheme has been approved by Government to credit all domestic electricity account holders with &euro;100 in 2022.</p></reply>

This includes homes that are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.  The SEAI aims to significantly reduce the waiting list in 2022, on the basis of working first on homes that are longest on the waiting list.</p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for residential and community retrofit this year. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households in the Warmer Homes Scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.548.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300083#WRM00400"><p>The premises referred to in the Question are located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.     I appreciate peoples frustration when they are living close to a fibre network owned by a commercial operator, but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 21 January, almost 294,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 154,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 11 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon and Tipperary and over 54,400 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties. In County Dublin surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Lusk, and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Skerries, with almost 4,000 premises surveyed to date and over 3,600 premises under construction.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Dublin through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 21 January, 454 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Newbridge House &amp;amp; Farm (approx. 3.6km from the premises referred to), Man O War GAA Club, Stars of Erin GAA / Dublin Mountain Community Centre, Tyrrelstown Community Centre, Fingal Ravens GAA Club, Glenasmole Community Centre, Applewood Community Centre, Fingal Liam Rodgers Centre and Luttrellstown Community Centre. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Balscadden National School has been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

The YAC will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student rates to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private car transport with the associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  For PSO services, it is likely the YAC will be supported through the existing Leap card platform; delivery mechanisms to deploy the YAC on commercial public transport services are less straightforward. The National Transport Authority (NTA), who has statutory responsibility for fare regulation, has commenced work in relation to the implementation of the new fares&rsquo; structures for young adults, and this includes examining how to integrate private operators into the scheme and the estimated cost for this.</p>  <p>  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

Preparations are also underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles including managing the delivery of EV charging infrastructure across the country.</p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. There are a number of incentives currently available to both private individuals, public sector organisations and businesses to support the installation of vehicle charging infrastructure. The national charging infrastructure strategy will review and, where appropriate, supplement and enhance these schemes, but I outline the incentives currently available below, for your information. </p><p>Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future. </p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>A report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at </p><p>In terms of existing incentives for charging points, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme later this year to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p><p>In addition, as part of the national charging infrastructure strategy, a destination charge point scheme is being developed by my Department which will provide funding for electric vehicle charging facilities at commonly accessed destinations. In this regard, I am minded to allow certain key publicly owned facilities at which members of the public access state services to apply for funding under this scheme to help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.597.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300084#WRN01300"><p>The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment.  The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the Help to Buy scheme itself would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question as to whether my Department will consider the introduction of a new scheme, similar to the HTB scheme, to assist first-time buyers of homes that are not new builds, it would be usual that proposals for tax expenditure measures would be assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.   </p>  <p>  A scheme along the lines proposed by the Deputy would provide no incentive effect for encouraging the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile the policy objective, lead to a narrowing of the tax base and a strong and convincing case for the benefits and outcomes need to be articulated in order for due consideration to be given for the commitment of scarce taxpayer resources for such reliefs.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may know, in my Budget 2022 address, in addition to announcing an extension of HTB for a further year, I also undertook that a formal review of the scheme would take place in 2022. The intention is that the review will be fundamental in nature, and that it will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022.</p></reply>

In particular, under Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code, a regulated firm that intends to cease operating, merge with another, or to transfer all or part of its regulated activities to another regulated firm, must:</p>  <p>  - provide affected consumers with at least two months&rsquo; notice to enable them to make alternative arrangements if they so wish; </p>  <p>  - ensure all outstanding business is properly completed prior to any transfer, merger or cessation of operations; or, in the case of a transfer or merger, inform customers as to how continuity of service will be provided following a transfer or merger; and</p>  <p>  - in the case of a merger or transfer of regulated activities, inform customers that their details are being transferred to the other regulated entity, if that is the case. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, on 25 June 2021, the Central Bank issued an industry letter regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. These expectations reflect its assessment of possible risks to consumers during periods of change and reinforce previously communicated expectations, based on its experience of prior events. The Central Bank expects that, by clearly outlining its expectations, this will inform regulated entities&rsquo; actions and decisions to ensure that customers&rsquo; interests are protected and potential risks are mitigated.</p></reply>

In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in Annex III of the VAT Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate from VAT.  Within its rates structure, the EU VAT Directive also allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III. Currently Ireland has a standard VAT rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.  Ireland also holds a number of derogations, under which is it permitted to retain some historic VAT arrangements, under strict conditions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is enquiring about the VAT rates applicable to certain categories of goods: food, fuel and fertiliser.</p>  <p>  Under Article 110 of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to continue to apply zero or very low rates of VAT where they already had these in place at 1 January 1991.  On this basis, Ireland continues to apply a zero rate of VAT to basic food products, but is not permitted to extend the scope of this derogation.  Other food items are subject to either the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% or the standard rate of 23%.</p>  <p>  Under another derogation, Ireland has retained its historic application of one of the reduced rates of VAT, 13.5%, to the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use and under the Directive the rate applicable to such services cannot be reduced below 12%.</p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the supply of motor fuel, specifically petrol and diesel, is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. There is no discretion under the Directive for Ireland to remove these supplies from the standard rate.</p>  <p>  As a further derogation related to historic arrangements, Ireland applies the zero rate of VAT to fertiliser, provided such fertiliser is supplied in units of not less than 10 kilos; otherwise, the standard rate of VAT applies.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that VAT returns do not require traders to separately identify the VAT amount associated with their supply of specific products or services. Therefore, the information required to estimate the cost that would be associated with reducing the VAT rate on specific items (even were this legally possible) is not readily available. </p>  <p>  Future tax changes are generally taken in the context of the Budget. Deputies will be aware that my officials prepare a series of papers containing tax options for the Tax Strategy Group to be considered in the context of the budgetary process, alongside a wide range of submissions from various stakeholders and lobby groups.</p></reply>

The Policy Statement commits the Civil Service to implementing a policy of blended working for the future that can provide flexibility to both employees and their employers in a manner that supports the continued delivery of high quality services to Government, the public and business while providing employees, where appropriate, with choice and opportunity. </p>  <p>  Remote working in the Civil Service, post COVID, will be facilitated on a blended basis.  In this context, Officials in my Department have been working with, and continue to work with employers across the Civil and Public Service to develop a Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service. This Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the sector and can assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public sector. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Framework will be finalised over the coming weeks following conclusion of the engagement with employee representatives.  Once finalised, the Framework will be rolled out to all civil service organisations and will inform the development of organisational blended working policies which will be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each Department/Office.</p>  <p>  On Tuesday 23 January, my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Public Enterprise and Employment published details of a new law which will give employees the right to request remote working.  The Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2021 will, for the first time, provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  When the proposed legislation is enacted, the Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service will be reviewed and, where necessary, will take on board any requirement to meet obligations in line with the legislation.</p></reply>

My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the Review.

The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be overstated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. </p>  <p>  The intention of the Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme is to research the impact a basic income grant scheme would have on artists and creatives work patterns by providing the opportunity to focus on their practice, and to minimise the loss of skills from the arts as a result of the pandemic and to contribute to the sectors gradual regrowth post pandemic. </p>  <p>  Like all income the grant payment will be reckonable for both income tax and social welfare means test purposes.  However, the level of tax paid and/or the impact on a social welfare payment will depend on each person's individual circumstances.  </p>  <p>  The means testing of social welfare payments is a statutory function of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD and I have no statutory role in that regard. Engagement on the pilot scheme has been ongoing between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Basic Income for the Arts scheme is not a social welfare payment, it is a grant payment and is a pilot scheme to research the impact of a basic income for the arts.  Consequently, it will be delivered on an administrative and not legislative basis.   </p>  <p>  I believe that the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector post pandemic and it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 47,600 new build social homes and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026. Under Housing for All, each local authority was required to prepare a Housing Delivery Action Plan, setting out details of social and affordable housing delivery in the period 2022-2026. </p><p>The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever standalone affordable housing legislation was enacted last July, establishing a basis for four new affordable housing measures. These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through; (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands; (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental; (3) a First Home shared equity scheme; and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>The delivery of affordable housing, in accordance with the schemes set out in the Affordable Housing Act, 2021 and the funding being made available, will be underpinned by local authorities' housing Delivery Action Plans. In drawing up their plans, each local authority assessed the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) and will plan provision accordingly. My Department is currently liaising with local authorities to finalise affordable housing targets at local authority level for the period 2022-2026.  </p><p>In September 2021, I issued social housing targets for build and long-term lease to all local authorities for 2022-2026. Details of the targets for each local authority are set out in the table below. There will also be a limited number of social homes delivered through acquisitions, with current projections limiting acquisitions to 200 new social homes per annum. </p></reply>

To resolve these, I asked the Workplace Relations Commission to engage with all parties aimed at reaching a collective agreement on a Framework for the future delivery of water services. In order to address the interests and concerns of each party to the transformation process, any such Framework must seek to accommodate:  </p> <blockquote> 	a.  The need to ensure Irish Water is given direct control of water services to provide for the safe and effective delivery of water services for citizens and to provide water services that meet the needs of a modern society and economy; <br /><br />b.  The union position that there is no forced transfer of the workforce; and<br /><br />c.  The need for local authorities to cease their involvement in public water services while also ensuring that they retain their capacity to continue to deliver on the full range of their vital statutory local government services and fulfil their social and economic development roles. </blockquote>  <p>In the context of such a wider overarching agreement on water sector transformation, it is recognised that local authority staff who transfer to Irish Water would do so on a voluntary basis.  Engagement at the WRC is ongoing at present. The Government believes it will be possible to reach a collective agreement which addresses the interests and concerns of all parties.</p></reply>

The comprehensive changes include:</p>  <p>  - The current 90% maximum grant will be increased to a 100% grant for all remediation options 1-5.</p>  <p>  - The maximum grant cap for option 1 (demolition and rebuild) will be increased from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000. </p>  <p>  - The grant calculation methodology in respect of option 1 remediation will be based on a cost per square foot with grant costings to be set by my Department following receipt of information on up to date construction costs from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). An indicative rate of &euro;145 per square foot for the first 1,000 sq foot with a sliding scale thereafter has been announced by my Department and this will be subject to review as required in line with construction cost changes.

Ireland is deeply concerned by the human rights abuses against civilians in Libya, including migrants and refugees. An important area of EU support to Libya remains migration management, including support to Libyan communities that host a particularly high number of migrants as well as to refugees and migrants themselves, and the protection of vulnerable groups. In strengthening the capacity of the relevant Libyan authorities, the focus of the EU is on training in Search and Rescue as well as in Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  In March 2022, the EU launched EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI to contribute primarily to the implementation of the UN arms embargo on Libya, however it also contributes to the disruption of the business model of human smuggling and trafficking networks through information gathering and patrolling by planes. Ireland currently has three Defence Forces personnel deployed in staff office posts at the Operational Headquarters (OHQ) of EUNAVFOR MED Operation IRINI in Rome. In addition, the European Union Integrated Border Management Assistance Mission in Libya (EUBAM Libya) was established in 2013. The protection and promotion of human rights is a central principle of EUBAM.  </p>  <p>  As well as support for migration and border management, important areas of EU assistance to Libya include protection of vulnerable populations; strengthening capacity for resilience; and recovery, stability and socio-economic development, including support to Libyan communities that host a particularly high number of people on the move as well as to refugees and migrants themselves. Key EU partners in Libya include UNHCR, the International Organisation for Migration and UNICEF. </p>  <p>  Ireland condemns all human rights violations and abuses against refugees and migrants. At the 2019 Global Refugee Forum, Ireland undertook a number of pledges to help improve the situation of refugees and migrants, including yearly funding to the International Organisation for Migration, who are a key partner in the Libyan migrant response. We continue to work closely with our EU partners on issues related to migrants and asylum seekers in Libya and elsewhere, and to ensure that the lives, welfare and rights of migrants are protected.</p></reply>

This process has already delivered a number of transformational improvements for citizens at home and abroad, in particular, the rollout of the Passport Online service. Passport Online can now be accessed by first time applicants, both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world. In 2021, approximately 90% of all applications were made online.</p><p>The next major reform underway is the replacement of the core technology underpinning the Passport Service. The current system, the Automated Passport System or APS, was launched in 2004 and will be replaced by a more modern, integrated system. An extensive procurement process, overseen by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), concluded in April 2021 with the award to a consortium led by Global. The Passport Issuance and Processing System (PIPS) contract was signed in September 2021 and the project officially commenced in November 2021.  This complex project is currently at an early stage and officials from my Department are actively working with the vendor to outline the high level design of the new system. Extensive detailed design, testing and phased implementation is to follow over the remainder of this year and much of 2023.  It is intended that the new system will be substantially operational by the end of 2023.</p><p>This will ensure the Passport Service benefits from a standard, scalable and resilient technical platform, capable of handling increased application volumes, while maintaining the high standards of security that are a hallmark of the Irish Passport. The Passport Online Service will remain in place as the fastest, easiest and safest way for citizens to apply.</p></reply>

Between January 2021 and May 2021, many Passport Service staff members were redeployed to assist with the national response to Covid-19 in essential public service roles, such as assisting the Department of Social Protection in the processing of Covid-19 related benefits, providing consular assistance to Irish citizens overseas and assisting the Public Appointments Services. During this period, emergency passport services were maintained and Passport Service staff assisted citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel. Taking account of Covid-19 protocols in place at that time, 67,000 passports were issued during that period.</p><p>At the end of the period of Level 5 restrictions and in the context of the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021&rdquo;, I advised the Government of my decision to categorise the Passport Service as an essential service and to scale up operations. Passport Service operations began scaling up on 4 May 2021. At this point, notwithstanding the excellent efforts of the Passport Service staff, a Covid related backlog of 89,000 passport applications had developed as customers continued to apply for non-urgent passports while services were disrupted. The figures in the table below show that a high number of applications were processed beyond the issue-by date. However, a significant proportion of these were received during the first four months of 2021 and could not be processed during Level 5 restrictions.  </p><p>The online Passport Tracker provides applicants with an indication of how their application is progressing through the system and gives an estimated issue date based on the current average application processing time. Given that this is an indication only of the estimated issue date based on current averages, this projected issue date is not an intended guarantee of delivery on that date.  This issue date relates to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants to not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures consistently show that 45% of applications at a point in time are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. Passport applications that are incomplete cannot be processed by the Passport Service.  The 41,434 applications cancelled in 2021 are primarily applications where no documentation was submitted within the six month of the application being made. <table>    <tr>       <th>2021</th>       <th>Issued on issue-by date </th>       <th>Issued before issue-by date </th>       <th>Issued after issue-by date </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Online Renewal Adult </td>       <td>36,270 </td>       <td>241,679 </td>       <td>75,506 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Online Renewal Child </td>       <td>8,669 </td>       <td>29,169 </td>       <td>56,282 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Online First Time Adult </td>       <td>1,931 </td>       <td>7,776 </td>       <td>21,541 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Online First Time Child </td>       <td>992 </td>       <td>7,918 </td>       <td>18,168 </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <td>Passport applications cancelled in 2021 </td>       <td>41,434 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

In November 2021 Government agreed to significantly expand these security requirements by means of legislating for the application of a set of Electronic Communications Security Measures, which have also been published for public consultation.  Aspects of internet infrastructure are also covered by the Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), as transposed by S.I. 360 of 2018, which also has some requirements around physical security.</p>  <p>  As part of the development of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, the Department engaged in a broad-ranging consultation process, including with all other Departments. At that time the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outlined that resilience is built into the system to mitigate against any damage to submarine cables. High capacity and multiple routes provide resilience in the event of route failure.  Business Continuity Planning is of interest to all major international corporations. Where damage has occurred to a cable in the past, the operators have shared a cable while repairs are made.  Under the National Cyber Security Strategy, an updated detailed risk assessment of the vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyber attack is being performed.</p>  <p>  The Defence Organisation, including the Naval Service, has no unilateral powers of enforcement in relation to damage, criminal or otherwise, to undersea cables or other communication links in Ireland&rsquo;s EEZ.  While the Defence Forces are aware of active subsea fibre optic cables landing on the island of Ireland, the locations and security of these telecommunication resources does not rest with the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Any contemplated enforcement at sea by the Naval Service would be incident-specific and progressed in conjunction with the relevant Lead Department or in an Aid to Civil Power to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

It accounts for around 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-03a.739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022020300087#WRQ03600"><p>My Department has provided guidance to schools in relation to the recording and reporting of COVID-19 related absences. COVID-19 related absences arising from pupils/students who have been requested to self-isolate by a medical professional or for students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 must be recorded in accordance with the school&rsquo;s normal procedures for the notification and recording of absences. However these COVID-19 related absences should be noted by the school as explained absences.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current COVID-19 related environment that schools are now operating in, the statutory requirements for reporting pupil absenteeism will continue as normal. In this respect the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires the principal of a recognised school to maintain records of the attendance or non-attendance on each school day of each pupil registered at that school which is reported to Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) receives notifications of absences from school in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. TESS is very aware that some students will be absent for Covid-19-related reasons. Absences are reported to TESS as explained and unexplained, and together they make up the cumulative number of days marked absent. This has remained the reporting requirement throughout Covid 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Daily school attendance data is collected and held at local school level and collected by Tusla at the aggregated level through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Absence Report (SAR). Any child who misses 20 school days must be reported to Tusla by law, however this may not result in any intervention, particularly if the absences are explained. Where schools have a concern about a child&rsquo;s attendance they are required to make a referral to TESS Education Welfare Service. TESS views all school attendance referrals from a child welfare perspective with the intention of finding solutions that will enable and support students to attend, participate and be retained in education.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  There are 3,500 places available on the online programme over 4 years.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and a new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme last September.</p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Schools may offer a module of Martial Arts, with an external or internal, qualified instructor, in addition to Physical Education lessons.</p>  <p>   Choices regarding educational services are made by individual schools and their boards of management, not by the Department. Schools are free to choose whatever resources they feel supports the delivery of the curriculum in their school. My Department provides clear guidance to schools on the engagement of outside speakers and on the use of external resources to assist in delivering the curriculum. These guidelines are most recently outlined in updated circular 0042/2018 for primary schools and 0043/2018 for post primary schools. Where an external facilitator is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school.  He or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it.</p>  <p>  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. In SPHE, students have opportunities to explore different themes which focus on developing self-awareness and respect for others, and the skills of self-management, communication, coping, decision-making and relating to others.</p>  <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe Programme is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme. The programme seeks to enhance children&rsquo;s self-protective skills by participation in lessons on safe and unsafe situations, bullying, inappropriate touch, secrets, telling and stranger danger. The primary SPHE programme as a whole is also due to be updated by the NCCA as part of the work resulting from the NCCA&rsquo;s review of RSE provision in schools.</p></reply>

There are currently approximately 145 schools across the country offering this subject to their students. </p>  <p>  The approach to the provision of the subject by schools has been informed by the valuable learning gathered from the phased introduction of LCCS since September 2018. </p>  <p>  Uniquely, this also included a Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Discover funded research project to track the development of progress of teachers of the subject during the first two years of the subject rollout. A Department led group was formed to assist in, and have oversight of, this research study and its findings.</p>  <p>  The introduction of this new subject to schools is supported by a Leaving Certificate Computer Science Support Framework. This framework represents a collaboration between the Department of Education, the Computers in Education Society of Ireland (CESI), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), the Irish Universities Association (IUA), higher education institutions, Ibec, the Technological Higher Education Association (THEA) and SOLAS.  </p>  <p>  The framework puts in place key actions to promote a broad take-up of the subject at both ordinary and higher level.

However, following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; monthly youth unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the PUP &ndash; increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020. </p><p>Following the phased reopening of the economy over the latter half of 2021, most young people closed their PUP claims and returned to work, with the CSO estimating that there were approximately 321,000 young people in employment by Q3 2021 &ndash; significantly more than before the pandemic. This recovery resulted in a sharp downward trend in youth unemployment rates, with the standard youth unemployment rate falling to a low of 9 percent, and the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure to 10.2 percent, by end-November 2021.</p><p>While a slight increase was observed in the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure of youth unemployment following the temporary reintroduction of public health restrictions in early December, I am confident that the vast majority of these young people will shortly return to work, following the widescale easing of restrictions.</p><p>While it is welcome that the youth unemployment rate has reduced and returned to pre-pandemic levels, it is critical to continue to minimise potential scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs during the pandemic and young people who face difficulties or higher barriers to entry.</p><p>Accordingly, my Department has introduced &ndash; with funding allocated in Budget 2022 &ndash; a series of targeted employment supports under <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025</i>, the Government&rsquo;s employment services strategy. These include:</p><p>- Expanding the JobsPlus scheme to 8,000 places and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers in particular, by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years.</p><p>- Launching the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more. While the programme has no age limit, it should be particularly attractive to young people looking to gain valuable work experience. 4,000 places on the programme have been ring-fenced for young people.</p><p>- Ring-fencing at least 1,000 out of the 3,000 additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for long-term unemployed young people.</p><p>My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities. These are likely to be of particular relevance to young people seeking to enter the labour market for the first time. As part of Budget 2022 and Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are providing an additional 50,000 further education and training places to help more people, including young persons, to have the opportunity to upskill or reskill for employment into a new sector. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

While some elements of the means testing arrangements are common to all schemes, there are some elements which vary from scheme to scheme.</p>  <p>  The assessment of savings and other capital reflects the fact that there is an expectation that persons with reasonable amounts of capital are in a position to use those savings to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means tested welfare payment.</p>  <p>  In the means assessment for a personal rate state pension non-contributory entitlement, the first &euro;20,000 of capital an applicant holds is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  For disability allowance, an applicant can have up to &euro;50,000 in savings and still receive the full rate of payment; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  Where a person has been in receipt of disability allowance immediately before becoming entitled to state pension non-contributory, and could stand to lose out financially due to the different means testing criteria, legislation provides that the rate of state pension non-contributory payable is at least equal to the due rate of disability allowance applicable in the same circumstances. This ensures that disability allowance recipients are not financially worse off when they move to receive state pension non-contributory. This provision has been applied in the case of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion. The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.</p><p>Carer's Benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for someone in need of full-time care and attention. A person may be eligible for Carer's Benefit if they have enough PRSI contributions. Carer&rsquo;s Benefit is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks for each person being cared for. It can be taken in one block or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks. The current weekly rate is &euro;225.00.</p><p>To be eligible for Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, a person must have at least 156 contributions paid at any time between their entry into insurance and the time they make a claim for Carer's Benefit. They must have:</p><p>- 39 contributions paid in the relevant tax year or</p><p>- 39 contributions paid in the 12-month period before the start of Carer's Benefit or</p><p>- 26 contributions paid in the relevant tax year and 26 contributions paid in the year before that.</p><p>The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the year in which a claim is made. So, for claims made in 2022, the relevant tax year is 2020.</p><p>PRSI contributions at Class A, B, C, D, H and E are counted towards Carer's Benefit.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review. However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in an overall budgetary context and in the light of available financial resources.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1), the Government extended the Social Welfare Acts to provide for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with, or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. Changes to the eligibility conditions for the payment have been made on an ongoing basis in line with changes to public health advice.</p>  <p>  The most recent change has been that the duration of payment for those considered a probable risk was reduced to 7 days from 14 January 2022. From that date, asymptomatic people who are close contacts and who have had their immunity boosted are not required to restrict their movements and are not entitled to receive enhanced Illness Benefit. Immunity is considered boosted if the person has received a booster or third vaccination or has had a Covid-19 diagnosis since 1st December 2021. This change complies with public health guidance in relation to a person's vaccination status.</p>  <p>  Enhanced Illness Benefit is hence not payable for an asymptomatic parent who stays at home to care for their child who is ill with Covid-19. This is similar to the situation for parents caring for children with any other illness.</p>  <p>  If, however, a parent in this situation starts showing symptoms of Covid-19, they should immediately self-isolate and, in this circumstance, can apply for enhanced Illness Benefit. Where a person has a Covid-19 diagnosis they may be paid for up to 10 weeks with appropriate medical certification from their GP.</p>  <p>  This Department will continue to keep the situation in relation to enhanced Illness Benefit under review in light of evolving public health guidance, to assist people who cannot work due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that claim processing is up to date, with processing targets met, or exceeded, on average for all the main scheme areas.</p><p>Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory). As the actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at over &euro;300,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life.</p>  <p>  Where a person enters the social insurance system over the age of 56 they will not be able to make sufficient social insurance contributions to be awarded a State Pension (Contributory) on reaching 66 years of age because it has a minimum contribution requirement of 520 contributions (i.e. 10 years). In such cases a level of social insurance refund may be applicable.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95%  of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory). Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his/her own right. The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension. The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment. The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved. The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process. It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model, phasing out of the Yearly Average approach, allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes and measures to enhance pension provision for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years).</p>  <p>  The report was referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for its views which were published yesterday. Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically. My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any specific recommendation.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.</p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland. It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty. This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Calculation of an applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to State pension (contributory) is based on their social insurance record from their date of entry into insurable employment until pension age, currently 66 years.  Pension entitlement depends on factors such as a person&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment. Depending on an applicant&rsquo;s individual social insurance history, their entitlement is assessed under a number of different tests to determine if they qualify for a pension. Where an applicant satisfies the criteria under more than one of these entitlement tests, the most financially beneficial rate of pension will ultimately be awarded.</p><p>According to the most recent records of the Department as of 31 December 2021, there are some 46,000 cases where State pension (contributory) was disallowed between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021 - typically, because the initial application based on their Irish insurance record  did not satisfy the scheme conditions - and which were subsequently awarded and are in payment at 31 December 2021. <table>    <tr>       <th>SPC claims disallowed and then awarded as at 31/12/2021</th>       <th><div> 2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020 </div></th>       <th><div> 2021</div></th>       <th><div> Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td><div> 16,377</div></td>       <td><div> 14,200</div></td>       <td><div> 15,577</div></td>       <td><div> 46,154</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Please see below the most recent available figures for the number of State pension (contributory) claims which were disallowed in each of the past three years and remain disallowed.  These figures do not include applicants who have since died.  Recently disallowed figures in 2021 may include cases where entitlement is still being assessed under further tests, such as on the basis of applicants&rsquo; foreign employment records. <table>    <tr>       <th>SPC claims disallowed and not awarded as at 31/12/2021</th>       <th><div> 2019</div></th>       <th><div>2020 </div></th>       <th><div> 2021</div></th>       <th><div> Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td><div>3,939 </div></td>       <td><div>3,544</div></td>       <td><div>4,763</div></td>       <td><div>12,246</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For those who do not qualify for the State pension (contributory), there are other State pension payments available, depending on an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  State pension (non-contributory) is a means-tested, residency-based payment for persons of pension age, based on the applicant's share of assessable household means.  The maximum rate payable equates to 95% of the maximum rate of state pension (contributory).</p><p>If a person&rsquo;s spouse has a State pension (contributory), the person may qualify for an Increase for qualified adult (IQA) payable with their spouse&rsquo;s pension (means-tested on their own means). The rate of IQA payable may amount to 90% of the maximum State pension (contributory), depending on the rate of State pension (contributory) in payment to the person&rsquo;s spouse and the person&rsquo;s own means, solely or jointly held.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To date, over 870,000 people have received payment under the scheme at a cost of &euro;9 billion and over 28 million payments have issued.</p>  <p>  The PUP scheme closed to new applications on 8 July 2021. </p>  <p>  The PUP scheme re-opened from 7 December 2021 to support persons who had lost their income from employment on or after that date as a result of the decision to temporarily impose restrictions on the trading of certain business sectors to slow the spread of COVID. These restrictions had a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality, the night-time economy, and the arts and entertainment sectors. </p>  <p>  The re-opening of the PUP scheme was specifically targeted at persons who were directly affected by the trading restrictions introduced on 7 December 2021. It did not involve a general re-opening of the scheme. The PUP scheme subsequently closed on 22 January 2022 following the lifting of restrictions on that date.</p>  <p>  Just over 48,000 individuals benefitted from the re-opening of the PUP scheme since 7 December. Processing of claims is up to date. Where a person did not qualify or supplied insufficient information to enable a decision on their claim, they were notified of this. Where a person subsequently contacted my Department to query the non-payment of their claim, follow-up action took place. Currently, there are no processing backlogs. </p>  <p>  COVID (Enhanced) Illness Benefit is a scheme that was introduced in March 2020, to support people who are incapable of work or who are required to self-isolate, as a result of a COVID diagnosis or being a probable source of infection.  To date a total of 416,175 COVID Illness Benefit related claims have been processed of which 382,587 have received a payment.  </p>  <p>  The majority of the standard Illness Benefit claims are automatically processed once medical certification from a GP and an application from the customer has been received.  </p>  <p>  Applications for COVID Enhanced Illness Benefit increased significantly during January due to transmission of the Omicron variant.  92% of these applications are processed within a week. Applications that require officer review to ensure eligibility for payment can take longer to process.  My officials are working to clear all claims as quickly as possible with additional resources allocated to this work as a priority. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has a particular case which he wishes to query, my officials are available to assist.</p></reply>

It was published in December 2021. It provides important evidence of the additional costs that people with a disability face in their day-to-day lives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy. As the evidence in the Cost of Disability in Ireland report has implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government approach is required to develop appropriate and timely responses and to ensure that everyday costs are reduced for people with disabilities and their families. </p>  <p>  For this reason, the coordination of this whole-of-government response is being carried out under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS). The NDIS is one of two national policy frameworks through which the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland are progressively realised. In addition to advancing key actions under the NDIS, my Department supports the implementation and monitoring of the NDIS by coordinating the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group (NDISSG). The Group is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D., and is attended by representatives of Departments, Agencies and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  The Cost of Disability in Ireland report was considered by the NDISSG in December 2021, within 24 hours of publication. Indecon International Research Economists presented the findings of their research to the NDISSG and it was agreed that at the next NDISSG, which will take place in March, the Group will discuss the approaches to be adopted to act on the findings and conclusions of the report.  The Group will examine meaningful action to reduce day to day costs for people with disabilities in Ireland. Aligning the findings and recommendations of the Cost of Disability in Ireland report to the NDIS will ensure that recommendations can be properly considered at whole of government level and that progress against actions taken will be monitored by the NDISSG and the Disability Stakeholder Group. </p>  <p>  Although the report provides an estimated additional cost range for people with a disability, the exact additional costs for any individual person with a disability will vary considerably depending on, for example, the age of the individual, the severity of disability, the nature of the disability and the household type. Through the NDIS, we will explore cross-Government ways in which the different dimensions of additional costs can be addressed fairly, equitably and sustainably. </p></reply>

The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is currently supporting more than 55,000 families to offset these costs, with a recent review of the NCS revealing that:</p><p>-  38% of families reported that half or more of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p><p>-  56% reported that they had more money to spend; and </p><p>-  28% reported that they were working more (with 8% reporting they would not be in work without the NCS).  </p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability and reduce the impact that this might have on choices about employment.</p><p>The recommendations of an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for early learning and childcare were adopted by Government in December.  This marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>The Expert Group recommended a number of developments to the NCS.  The recommendations include extending the universal subsidy to all children under 15 which was announced in Budget 2022.  The report also recommends increasing the value of the universal NCS subsidy and revising the approach to calculating subsidies for families with multiple children.  </p><p>The new funding model also recommends a new approach to fee management.  This will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access a new funding schemes in 2022.  </p><p>The introduction of this requirement (with the approach to fee management to be developed over time) means that parents will not be faced with fee increases, and the full affordability effects of the NCS, the NCS reform announced in Budget 2022 and indeed any reforms to the NCS in future Budgets can be fully realised.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach has confirmed that the Minister for Justice will have the leading role. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a number of commitments in respect of DSGBV, including a plan for additional refuge spaces. Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review examines current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services, unmet need and proximity to refuge by local communities. The Review has made a number of recommendations on the location of refuge facilities, funding and future configuration of services that will support the needs of victims of DSGBV. </p>  <p>  Government will be guided by the recommendations of the Review. I expect that the implementation process for the Review will identify priority areas where there is greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV. A draft of the Review has been shared with all stakeholders on the Monitoring Committee of the 2nd National DSGBV Strategy and it will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Tusla allocated &euro;28m in core funding for DSGBV services and an additional &euro;2m in contingency funding to address challenges arising from COVID-19.  Core funding of services will increase to &euro;30m for 2022 and additional resources have been allocated to address the recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s Accommodation Review.  </p>  <p>  The impact of Covid and recent tragic events have shown the horrific effect of DSGBV on women, communities and society. In recent weeks I have been involved in discussions with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice as part of considerations by the Government to address the impact of DSGBV. The Minister for Justice will soon publish the 3rd National Strategy on DSGBV which I believe will present a comprehensive and targeted response to the critical issues involved, with a particular focus on prevention. </p></reply>

Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved.</p>  <p>  In relation to dialogue regarding children at risk, the Department chairs a statutory interdepartmental committee on Children First where matters of risk and safeguarding, across all Government areas, are reviewed regularly. </p></reply>

Members include disability organisations, disabled people's organisations (DPOs), individuals with disabilities and family members and support groups. They represent a wide and diverse set of experiences of disabilities which ensures a huge amount of knowledge and experience is available.  </p><p>The Network is not the only means by which my Department seeks to fulfil its UNCPRD obligations. My Department has the coordinating role in respect of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the steering group of which is chaired by my colleague Minister Anne Rabbitte T.D.. Incorporated into this structure is the Disability Stakeholder Group, which provides independent monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy.  It is a voluntary group of 26 individuals with expertise and lived experience of disability.  Members include DPOs, representatives from disability organisations, alongside individuals, persons with lived experience, family members and academics.  The current iteration of the DSG (DSG 6) commenced this year following an expression of interest for members last Summer.  </p><p>In addition to these two more formal consultation groups, my Department also seeks to use wider public consultation through submissions, surveys and online and in person workshops to ensure that as many views from disability groups and stakeholders are collated and incorporated into policy developments.  </p></reply>

The Acts cover nine grounds of equality, including that of disability.  In addition, the Acts prohibit discrimination in the provision of accommodation services against people who are in receipt of rent supplement, housing assistance, or social welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  Where an individual considers that they have been discriminated against based on one of the named grounds, it is open to them to make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  </p>  <p>  My Department conducted a consultation seeking the public&rsquo;s views on a review of the Equality Acts (Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015), which ran from July to December last year. The review will examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and promoting equality, including in relation to disability. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. Our determination to improve services and supports for people with disabilities and their families is clear in our Programme for Government. My colleague at the Department of Health, Minister Donnelly, secured an additional package of &euro;115m in Budget 2022 (including &euro;10m one-off Covid funding for specialist community-based disability services which are delivered or funded by the HSE, and builds on the &euro;100m funding allocated in 2021 to enhance these specialist disability services.   </p>  <p>  The Disability Capacity Review to 2032 sets out the Disability Social Care Demand and Capacity Requirements up to 2032.  This review has carefully drawn on best available evidence and information to estimate the scale of current outstanding need for HSE-funded disability services, and how the scale and shape of need is likely to evolve over the years to 2032. </p>  <p>  Work is underway on preparing an Action Plan for Disability Services 2022-2025, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to work towards implementing the Disability Capacity Review.</p></reply>

Youth Officers provide an important support role to my Department in the co-ordination and administration of youth services at local level. My officials hold quarterly meetings with the ETBs and these meetings assist my Department in identifying service needs and emerging issues, particularly for vulnerable young people. </p>  <p>  The UBU scheme which is operated by the ETB's is underpinned by the Area Profile, Needs Assessment and Service Requirement (APNASR) process. </p>  <p>  The APNASR Tool allows each Education and Training Board (ETB) to gather and use available demographic data and local knowledge to produce an area profile of their functional area. </p>  <p>  The ETB carries out an analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data to identify and evidence the needs of young people.  This results in a Service Requirement that is the basis for an application by organisations under UBU Your Place Your Space.  This process ensures equality for all youth services applying for UBU Your Place Your Space Funding. </p>  <p>  DCEDIY also maintains close contact with 30 national youth organisations which it funds under the Youth Service Grant Scheme. The Minister and officials meet formally with these organisations twice a year to share knowledge and information on developments or challenges in the youth sector. This provides a forum for organisations to give information on national issues but also identify specific locations that require additional focus. Throughout Covid-19, the Department engaged with a representative group from the sector on pandemic specific issues including the regular updating of national guidelines for the youth sector relating to COVID.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department also meet formally with youth organisations on an individual basis when the need arises and also maintain informal contacts.  </p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic, the Department will continue to ensure there is sufficient engagement with this important sector which provides enormous value to young people.</p></reply>

Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for the greater number of separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports and airports.</p>  <p>  SCSIP who arrive in Ireland are received into care. These children are placed by Tusla either in specialist residential care centres with a maximum of six children, or with specifically recruited foster families. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card, access to education services and have a social worker allocated to them.    </p>  <p>  The basis for care of a SCSIP is different from the general child in care population; they are not received into care to protect them from their family but rather for welfare reasons due to their separation from their primary carers, which can be  as a consequence of war or persecution. </p>  <p>  The right to family reunification is a well-established principle of human rights law and of particular relevance to SCSIP. Given that it is a statutory right of SCSIP to apply for family reunification Tusla is of the view that its role is to ensure that those rights are upheld and further, to support the applicant in their application for family reunification as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Consequently, reunification work has evolved to be a key piece of the support Tusla staff provide to SCSIP in State care and who are eligible to apply.  The process of reunification is commenced as soon as the young people come to the attention of Tusla with an aim to re-establish contact with the family of origin as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Centre of Excellence has oversight of the implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>and supports ongoing work to implement the <i>Framework </i>through funding initiatives, centralised support and monitoring of annual progress. As part of monitoring requirements, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress on implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>on an annual basis. </p><p>All publicly funded HEIs have action plans in place to address this issue and have assigned responsibility to a member of senior leadership, most often in the form of the Vice-President for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. The HEA Centre of Excellence works closely with these stakeholders to both support and monitor progress in our goal to end sexual violence and harassment in higher education institutions. This work includes funding and support of targeted projects, such as the Speak Out anonymous reporting tool that was launched last year. </p><p>An expert Advisory Group was established in 2021 to advise my Department and the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion on policy relating to addressing sexual violence and harassment in Irish higher education institutions. This group of experts provides advice on consent framework implementation and future areas of priority in relation to ending sexual violence and harassment in higher education. The advisory group consists of the independent members of the original task force that developed the framework and other relevant experts and stakeholders. The group is currently developing an implementation plan following the recent publication of reports on student and staff experiences of sexual violence and harassment. The recommendation mentioned by the Deputy will come before the advisory group for consideration as part of its ongoing work in this area.</p></reply>

A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.</p><p>The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p><p>My Department will now work with the Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in the HEA, the higher education sector and the HEA Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) to implement the recommendations in these reports. </p><p>Data from annual HEI progress updates to the HEA on implementation of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>and the findings of the survey reports will provide an evidence base for any funding and priority areas identified in the reports&rsquo; recommendations. My intention is to develop an implementation plan to consolidate the advances that have been made in this area since the publication of the <i>Framework for Consent in HEIs</i>in April 2019. The HEA Advisory Group will act as the implementation oversight group, working alongside the HEA's Centre for Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion and my Department. </p></reply>

In line with the prevailing public health advice, my Department has implemented a suite of measures to help reduce the spread of the virus. This has unavoidably led to a reduction in processing capacity across many business areas at certain times. However, it is important to say that citizenship applications have continued to be accepted and decisions have issued at all times during the pandemic.</p><p>Last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were delivered, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p><p>From the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This is freeing up valuable staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. </p><p>Following an initial assessment of new applications, all applicants are issued with an acknowledgement and an application reference number. It is open to any applicant to contact the Citizenship Division of my Department at <i>www.citizenshipinfo@justice.ie</i>at any time, for an update on their application.</p><p>A number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times to between 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022.  </p></reply>

The IPS intends piloting  electric vehicles at two sites, to determine deliverables and suitability to its requirements. Two charging points will be installed to facilitate this pilot project. These will be for IPS fleet vehicles only at this juncture.I am advised that current market analysis by the IPS indicates that there are no viable electric vehicles that will currently facilitate a move to electric vehicles for prisoner escort cellular transport, based on current commercial vehicle range capacities and reliability. </p><p>As part of any expansion of an electric vehicle programme, the IPS will need to establish a national network of electric vehicle charging points at prisons and other IPS sites. </p><p><b>Courts Service</b></p><p>Works to facilitate the installation of car chargers were included in the specifications for the seven courthouses under the Courts Bundle PPP project, which were delivered in 2017/18. A similar approach will be taken for all future courthouse construction/refurbishment projects.</p><p>Currently, there are electric car chargers installed at Wexford Courthouse and Mullingar Courthouse. Chargers are currently being installed at the Mulgrave Street Limerick and Anglesea Street Cork courthouses. There are plans to install chargers at Waterford Courthouse, Letterkenny Courthouse and Drogheda Courthouse in the near future. In each case, two car charging spaces are being provided. The Court Service does not have any electric vehicles. </p><p><b>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</b></p><p>There are currently 49 electric vehicle charging points installed at sixteen Garda station locations, as detailed in the table below. The Fleet Management and Estate Management divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently liaising to identify and prioritise additional Garda stations for electric vehicle charging point installation.</p><p>There are currently 11 electric vehicles in operation across the Garda fleet.  A further 30 have been ordered with expected delivery in Q2 2022. It is planned that these electric vehicles will be allocated to Garda Stations that currently have charging points. There are currently 3218 vehicles in the Garda fleet, of which electric vehicles represent 0.34%, with an anticipated rise to 1.27% at the end of 2022. </p><p>The purchase and allocation of vehicles is made on the basis of identified operational demands and the availability of resources, and is reviewed on a continual basis. The allocation of Garda vehicles is monitored and reviewed on a continual basis to ensure the best match with operational requirements.   <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Location </b></th>       <th><b>No of EV Charging Points </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fitzgibbon Street </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballymun </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Claremorris </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cong </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Knock </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Garda HQ </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Garda College </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rathfarnham </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blanchardstown </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Letterkenny </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drogheda </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westport </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Airport </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Athlone </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stepaside </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>49</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is ongoing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible in 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of finalising a Family Justice Strategy, which will set out a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. </p>  <p>  To develop the new strategy, a Family Justice Oversight Group was established by my Department. To assist its work, this Group has engaged in a phased consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. As part of the consultation process, two advisory groups have also been established comprising a subset of (1) NGOs and (2) practitioners and academics to further engage on issues emerging from the initial consultation phases.</p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. As part of the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill, specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge. An action to publish the new family justice strategy will be included in Justice Plan 2022. </p>  <p>  To better inform further discussion on parental alienation, my Department arranged for research to be carried out last year, with the Research and Data Analytics Unit of my Department having prepared a research brief.</p>  <p>  Following a competitive tender process in May, research commenced on this important work in June. The aims of the research included to:</p>  <p>  - Identify the various definitions and characteristics of parental alienation being used internationally.</p>  <p>  - Investigate what is known about the prevalence of this issue (in Ireland or internationally) through examination of the literature.</p>  <p>  - Identify and outline the various approaches and responses being taken in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of parental alienation (legislative and otherwise).</p>  <p>  - Describe, outline and evaluate any studies which have examined the effectiveness of these various international approaches and assess the relevance of these studies to the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that a draft report was received by my Department at the end of November and is now being reviewed. It is also my intention to commence a public consultation on the topic in the coming weeks. Both the research and consultation will, I expect, create a deeper understanding of the issue, and inform my Department&rsquo;s consideration of policy and law in this area.</p>  <p>  The best interests of the child will of course be paramount in any considerations.</p></reply>

I am currently leading work on a new whole of government Domestic, Sexual, Gender Based Violence strategy to tackle these horrendous crimes.</p>  <p>  This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic violence.</p>  <p>  The Strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. In the coming weeks, I will begin a final round of consultation so that I can publish the strategy and associated implementation plan as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, depending on the circumstances of the individual case, a perpetrator of domestic violence may be charged with specific offences such as an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, murder, manslaughter, a sexual offence, the offence of coercive control, or the offence under section 33 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 of contravention of a domestic violence order.</p>  <p>  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but also to the individual offender; in that process, identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present. Section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 provides that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in the context of a marriage, civil partnership or an intimate and committed relationship, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing. This sentencing provision applies to any offence that involves violence or the threat of violence to a person. </p>  <p>  These provisions, as with all criminal legislation, are kept under review to ensure they remain effective, proportionate and fully compliant with due process and the Constitution. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that I recently announced my intention to publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation.  While both are covered by existing law, I will be proposing changes to make the law clearer and stronger.</p></reply>

In June 2019, the Government approved the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of such cameras by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The Bill will also provide for the extension of the circumstances in which Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) devices may be used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My Department engaged extensively with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Garda oversight bodies and strategic partners during the preparation of the General Scheme, as well as the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on 29 April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of March 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.  </p>  <p>  I should point out that while this will not be an excessively long Bill, the issues that it addresses such as privacy rights and data protection, are complex.  All use of recording devices under the Scheme is linked to Garda functions, namely the investigation, detection, prevention and prosecution of criminal offences, public order and public safety, and safeguarding the security of the State. </p>  <p>  While Garda&iacute; have extensive common law powers at their disposal when carrying out their functions, it is important to have in place a modern and robust statutory framework to set standards and procedures in relation to the use of recording devices and to provide appropriate oversight of the use of the powers, in particular where they could infringe on the privacy or data protection rights of citizens.</p>  <p>  Digital recording technology for policing purposes continues to evolve.  A number of safeguards will have to be built in to the legislation to ensure that any intrusions into a citizens private life are necessary and proportionate and are for justifiable policing purposes.  </p></reply>

The programme provides investors with the opportunity to invest in Ireland. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest. To date, more than 1,400 IIP applications have been approved for investment with a value of over &euro;1 Billion.  </p>  <p>  The IIP has been subject to a number of reviews, both internal and external, in recent years and the second phase of the review referred to by the Deputy is being considered by my officials.

It is a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting: fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Data Protection Commission have carried out an in-depth, independent review of community CCTV schemes. My Department is incorporating amendments into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill to address these findings. </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill 2021 was approved by the Government and published on the 29th April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. The General Scheme was also submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report was received in December 2021 and is currently being examined by my officials. It is my intention to publish the Bill by the end of March 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year. </p>  <p>  This Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. It is expected the Bill will be enacted in 2022.  The legislation, once enacted, will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p>  <p>  I am informed that  &euro;1m funding has been allocated in the Garda vote for the CCTV Scheme for 2022.</p></reply>

The Commissioner is also responsible for determining the deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State under the Act and, as Minister, I play no role in these independent functions.</p><p>The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels.

Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department have any role in the processing of individual vetting applications. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016, provides for certain convictions to become spent once 7 years have passed since the date of conviction. </p>  <p>  In general and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the following convictions may become spent:</p>  <p>  1. All convictions in the District Court for motoring offences which are more than 7 years old subject to the proviso that spent convictions for dangerous driving are limited to a single conviction.</p>  <p>  2. All convictions in the District Court for minor public order offences which are more than 7 years old.</p>  <p>  3. In addition, where a person has one, and only one, conviction (other than a motoring or public order offence) which resulted in a term of imprisonment of less than 12 months or a fine, that conviction is spent after 7 years. This provision applies to either a District Court or Circuit Court conviction.</p>  <p>  4. A conviction resulting in a non-custodial sentence can also become spent after 7 years. This means such a sentence imposed by a court of imprisonment for a term of 2 years or less, the execution of the whole of which is suspended for a period specified by the court and that suspension is not subsequently revoked in whole or in part by the Court, and is not in addition to a custodial sentence.</p>  <p>  There is no formal procedure to be gone through to have a conviction declared spent. If the conviction is eligible to be spent, it becomes spent once seven years has passed from the date of conviction.</p>  <p>  It is important to understand that while a conviction may become spent under Irish law, this does not mean that the conviction ceases to be part of the person's criminal record. The effect of the Act is that, although it remains part of the person&rsquo;s criminal record, the person will not be penalised in law or incur any liability for failing to disclose a spent conviction. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that in some cases, disclosure of a spent conviction is required in circumstances including for example for specified work, such as with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, or applying for a public service vehicle, private security, taxi or firearm licence. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not required to expunge the details of such offences from the Garda PULSE system and a court may also admit or require evidence regarding a spent conviction in certain circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government commits in the Programme for Government to reviewing the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 and to broaden the range of convictions that are considered spent. As part of this review process, a public consultation on spent convictions was launched in October 2020. My Department is continuing work on identifying and assessing the possible implications of amending the 2016 Act so that the fairest possible outcomes can be achieved for the public.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team. Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  When separated children seeking international protection arrive at an Irish port the International Protection Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Border Management Unit contact Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to assess the child&rsquo;s circumstances. </p>  <p>  I have been informed that Tusla&rsquo;s assessment of the child&rsquo;s circumstances includes an assessment of how the child arrived in Ireland, and includes any concerns in relation to child trafficking. </p>  <p>  Separated children may present for reunification, sometimes with an agent, to be reunified with a family member in Ireland or the UK.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that under Tusla&rsquo;s obligations under the Child Care Act, 1991, and Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, 2015, Tusla considers the risk of harm that a young person(s) may be in, including working with other state agencies on the possibility that the child may have been trafficked.  </p>  <p>  If required, the child is received into care until a more extensive child protection and welfare assessment can be undertaken and interagency working continues as required. If the outcome of the Social Work assessment is that the child is at risk of harm and should not be reunified with the alleged guardian/parent, then in accordance with the Tusla/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na joint protocol, Tusla forwards notifications of child abuse (indicating suspected trafficking) to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who determine if a crime has been committed and any criminal investigations into trafficking.</p></reply>

Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide. Staff in these section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive those cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants. They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements. While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission in relation to a process of pay restoration for staff employed in Section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. Only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process were included.  </p>  <p>  It must be acknowledged that Section 39 organisations are privately owned and run and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee. </p>  <p>  Consequently, it would not be appropriate for the Department of Health or the Minister of Health to comment on terms and conditions of employment within the private sector.</p>  <p>  Pay restoration is absolutely limited and only applicable to those included in the initial WRC agreement. I can also confirm that there is no scope to revisit the eligibility criteria for the process and that from a Departmental point of view, the process has reached a final resolution.</p></reply>

These initiatives include: </p><p>- GP Liaison Nurses to manage direct referrals from GPs to ED; </p><p>- Geriatric Community Support; </p><p>- Enhancement and expansion of Frailty Intervention Therapy Team models; </p><p>- Community Response Teams (nursing and therapies); </p><p>- Community respiratory admission avoidance teams; </p><p>- Expansion of the National Ambulance Service Pathfinder initiative </p><p>- Additional home support hours and </p><p>- COPD outreach teams. </p><p>Emergency Departments across the country are experiencing high attendance levels. The EDs must prioritise those with serious or life threatening injuries and illnesses.  There are other options available to those requiring less urgent care. For example, many patients with limb injuries can go to an Injury Unit and others with illnesses needing less urgent treatment can be seen and treated by their GP or referred by their GP to an Assessment Unit the following day. </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised regarding the emergency department at Tallaght University Hospital, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In that respect, officials from my Department and from the HSE have held two rounds of discussions with the IDA, the most recent on 17 December last when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, including &euro;10m provided in the Budget, on top of the 2022 Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million.</p>  <p>  The Department / HSE has offered increased fees across a number of items and proposed the reintroduction of the Scale and Polish item. They also made it clear that these interim measures are designed to shore up the existing Scheme, pending the full root-and-branch review of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  These proposals were expedited to address not only the problem of access for patients, but also concerns expressed by dentists about the viability of the DTSS, and to some extent, to bring about alignment with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by dentists for PRSI patients.</p>  <p>  The Department is anxious to move the process on, in the interests of patients, and is hoping to meet the IDA again in the next couple of weeks to progress matters.</p></reply>

Under section 7 of the Act, a review of the operation of the Act must be initiated within three years of the commencement of the Act, i.e., before January 2022. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, the review will comprise a three-part approach to appraise the operation of the Act, with strands focusing on service users, service providers and a public consultation. Independent research commissioned to inform the service user and service provider strands will form key elements of the review. </p>  <p>  As I stated during my appearance before the Joint Committee on Health on 8 December, it was my intention to appoint an independent Chair to lead the second phase of the review of the operation of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  </p>  <p>  As the costs involved in contracting an independent Chair to conduct the review were estimated as exceeding &euro;25,000, the advice I received was that the Department was obliged under procurement rules to tender for the appointment.  </p>  <p>  Given the expertise required for the position, a small number of candidates, identified as having suitable experience, were contacted and invited to tender for the role of independent Chair.</p>  <p>  Following the tender process, I have now appointed Ms Marie O'Shea B.L. as the independent Chair for the second phase of the review. Ms O&rsquo;Shea has legal expertise, as well as experience in project management and in healthcare sector research. I look forward to receiving the Chair's final report, incorporating her conclusions and any recommendations, in due course.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Department is precluded from funding the purchase of equipment such as Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS) equipment by contractors under TAMS, unless they are also farmers.</p>  <p>  Under the terms and conditions for the LESS measure, the scheme is open to farmers who:</p>  <p>  (i) hold a Department identifier </p>  <p>  (ii) prior to submitting the online TAMS II application have a minimum of 5 hectares of land owned and/or leased or rented which have been declared under the Basic Payment Scheme or equivalent in the year of application or preceding year, or </p>  <p>  (ii) are engaged in the breeding, rearing or fattening of pigs and have a minimum of 60 production units at the time of application in accordance with Annex B of the Scheme; </p>  <p>  (iv) Nitrates Derogation applicants (as defined under Statutory Instruments 605 of 2017, 65 of 2018, 40 of 2020) are no longer eligible to apply and receive approval for LESS equipment. Furthermore, applicants farming at or above 170 kgs/N per hectare (as defined under Statutory Instrument 529/2020) in the year of application or the preceding year, will not be eligible for approval after 15 April 2022. Applicants farming below 170 kgs/N per hectare continue to be eligible for LESS equipment Or </p>  <p>  (v) in the case of a co-operative, all the members of the co-operative have to each independently meet the eligibility criteria laid down in (i), (ii) or (iii) above.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that a new Capital Investment Scheme under Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan will, if approved, provide support to the same category of applicants as TAMS II i.e. farmers or groups of farmers.

Critically, the availability of this volume of timber, at nearly 8.5 million cubic metres, stabilised supply to the processing sector in 2021. This is the highest volume ever issued in a single year. </p>  <p>  In addition, 264 kilometres of forest roads were licensed, more than double the target in the Climate Action Plan 2019. This is also the highest ever volume of forest roads issued in a single year. The number afforestation licences remained static, with 502 afforestation licences issued, which represents 4,245 ha of forestry.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of January 2022, the Department had 4,803 licence applications on hand. This figure has reduced from 6,100 in August 2021.  There will always be applications in the system, making their way from application stage to a licence.  The Forestry Licensing Plan for this year is currently being finalised and will be published shortly. It will build on the momentum achieved in 2021 and will focus on increasing the number of afforestation licences issued. We will continue to keep resources under review and will implement all practical process improvements which result from the review and analysis in train under Project Woodland.  </p>  <p>  Afforestation has not improved as we would like with just over 4,200 ha approved last year. Improving afforestation licensing is a key priority for 2022.  A greater concern for all of us must be that the number of afforestation applications has continued its downward decline in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Reversing this trend, I believe requires a concerted effort now, from everybody with an interest in seeing more trees planted in Ireland.  2022 will be a big year for farmers, with the arrival of a new CAP and new Forestry Programme and it is important that the benefits of afforestation are well understood by them.  My Department is, as always, ready to play its part and assist in improving communications.  We understand of course that licensing forestry activities has a role to play hence the importance attached to improved licensing output in 2022.  However, positive messaging around the benefit of afforestation is the responsibility of all, particularly those with a direct line of communication to farmers and landowners.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, I remain fully committed to delivering a licensing system which will meets the needs of the sector and of society and recent licensing trends demonstrate that we are making progress towards achieving this.</p></reply>
